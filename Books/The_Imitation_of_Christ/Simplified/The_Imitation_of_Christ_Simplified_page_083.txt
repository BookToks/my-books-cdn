Even if someone accuses you unfairly, don’t let it bother you too much.

And don’t get too proud if others prove you innocent. Remember, I am the one who looks deep into people’s hearts and thoughts. I don’t judge just by what things look like on the outside. What people think is good might actually be wrong to Me.

MY STUDENT, Lord God, You are a fair judge, strong and patient. You know how weak and flawed people are. Be my strength and my confidence because I can’t trust my own feelings completely. You know things I don’t, so I should be humble when people accuse me and accept it calmly. Please forgive me when I fail to do this and help me be stronger.

Your mercy is more important to me than trying to defend myself. Even if I don’t see any fault in myself, I can’t say I’m right without Your mercy. No one can be made right without it.

THE FORTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER  
EVERY CHALLENGE MUST BE ENDURED FOR ETERNAL LIFE  

MY CHILD, don’t let the hard work you do for Me wear you out, and don’t let problems bring you down. Let My promises give you strength and comfort. I can reward you more than you can imagine.

You won’t have to work or suffer forever. Wait a little while, and the bad times will end quickly. One day, all pain and trouble will be gone. Everything that passes with time isn’t important.

Do your best in everything you do. Work honestly in My field. I will be your reward. Write, read, sing, cry, stay quiet, pray, and face hardships bravely. Eternal life is worth all these struggles. Peace will come on a day only I know. Then there won’t be day or night like now, but endless light, brightness, peace, and rest. You won’t ask, “Who will save me from this painful life?” or say, “I’m sad that life goes on.” Death will be gone, and health will never fail. There will be no worries, only joy and good company.

If you could see the eternal crowns and great glory of the saints in heaven — people who were once looked down on and almost forgotten — you would immediately humble yourself completely and choose to serve others instead of wanting to be in charge.

You wouldn’t want the easy, happy days of this life. Instead, you’d be glad to suffer for God, seeing it as the best thing, being counted as nothing by others.
