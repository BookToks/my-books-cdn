Even Your saints, Lord, who now are happy with You in heaven, waited patiently and believed in Your glory while they were alive. What they believed, I believe too. What they hoped for, I hope for, and where they reached, I trust I will get there by Your grace. Meanwhile, I will live by faith, encouraged by the example of the saints. I will also find comfort and guidance in the holy Books, and especially in Your holy Body, which is my special refuge.

I feel I need two things in this life without which it would be very hard to live. Trapped in this body, I admit I need food and light. So, You have given me Your sacred Flesh to refresh my soul and body, and Your word to guide my steps. Without these, I could not live properly, because God’s word is the light of my soul and Your Sacrament is the Bread of Life.

These two can be called the two tables, one here and one there, in the Church’s treasure house. One is the altar table, which has the holy Bread that is the precious Body of Christ. The other is the table of divine law, which holds the holy teaching that shows the true faith and leads people to the Holy of Holies.

Thank You, Lord Jesus, Light of eternal light, for the table of Your holy teaching, prepared for us by Your servants—the prophets, Apostles, and other wise people.

Thank You, Creator and Savior of people, who to show Your love to everyone, have prepared a great feast. You gave us not a lamb as food, which was a symbol of Yourself, but Your own precious Body and Blood. This makes all believers happy at Your sacred meal, filling them with the cup of salvation that has all the joys of paradise. The holy angels feast with us too, but with even more happiness.

Oh, how great and important is the job of the priest! He is given the honor to bless the Lord with sacred words, to hold Him in his hands, to receive Him with his tongue, and to give Him to others!

Oh, how pure those hands must be, how clean the lips, how holy the body, how pure the heart of the priest whom the Author of all purity visits so often. No words but holy and good ones should come from the lips of the priest who often receives Christ’s Sacrament. His eyes should be modest and used to looking at the Body of Christ. His hands should be pure and lifted up to heaven as they handle the Creator of everything.

To priests, especially, it says in the law: “Be holy, because I, the Lord your God, am holy.” Let Your grace, almighty God, help us so that we who have taken on the priest’s work may serve You worthily, purely, and with a good heart. And if we can’t live as perfectly as we should, at least help us to feel sorry for the wrong things we have done and, with humility and good will, serve You even better in the future.
