If you don’t get what you want, or if for some reason it’s taken away, blame yourself and your mistakes. Sometimes, a small problem blocks the good things from coming to you, even if that problem feels big. But if you get rid of this problem, whether it’s big or small, and handle it perfectly, you will get what you’re asking for. When you give yourself fully to God and don’t ask for things just because you want them, but trust Him completely, you will feel peaceful and connected with Him. Nothing will feel as good or make you as happy as doing what He wants.

Anyone who honestly tries to focus on God and stops caring too much about other people or things will be ready to receive grace and love from God. When God sees a heart that’s empty of selfish stuff, He fills it with His blessing.

The more someone gives up worldly things and stops putting themselves first, the faster and stronger this great grace will come to them. It will lift their heart higher and higher.

Then they will feel amazed and happy because God’s hand is holding them, and they have trusted Him completely. This person is truly blessed because they look for God with all their heart and don’t waste their time on themselves. When they receive Holy Communion, they earn the grace to be united with God because they don’t focus on their own thoughts or comfort but on honoring God above all.

Chapter Sixteen: We Should Tell Christ What We Need and Ask for His Help

Dear kind and loving Lord, I want to receive You with all my heart. You know how weak I am and all the problems I face, how often I feel sad, tempted, dirty, and troubled.

I come to You for help and comfort. I talk to You because You know everything about me and are the only one who can truly help and comfort me.

You know what I really need and how little good I have.

Here I am, poor and empty, asking for Your grace and mercy.

Feed me when I’m hungry. Warm up my cold heart with Your love.

Open my eyes with Your presence. Make all the things of this world feel less important to me, turn hardships into patience, and make me forget about lowly things.

Lift my heart up to You in heaven and don’t let me get lost here on earth.

From now until forever, let You be the sweetest thing to me, because You alone are my food and drink, my love and joy, my happiness and everything good.
