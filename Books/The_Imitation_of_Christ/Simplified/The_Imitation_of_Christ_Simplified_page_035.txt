Chapter Seven: Loving Jesus More Than Anything

You are lucky if you understand what it means to love Jesus and if you can put Him first, even if it means being tough on yourself. Let go of all other loves because Jesus wants to be the most important one in your life.

Loving people or things can be tricky and change all the time, but loving Jesus is real and lasts forever. If you hold on to people or things, you might get hurt when they fail, but if you trust Jesus, He will always make you stronger.

So love Jesus and keep Him as your best friend. He won’t leave you like others might, and He won’t let you be truly lost. One day, whether you want to or not, you’ll have to let go of everything. That’s why you should hold on tight to Jesus in life and even in death. Trust Him because He alone can help when everyone else fails.

Jesus wants your heart all to Himself. He won’t accept anything that belongs to someone else. If you learn to let go of everything else, Jesus will happily live inside you.

If you look for help only from people, you’ll often be disappointed because people are weak and changeable. Don’t rely on anything shaky because everything in life fades away like grass and flowers.

If you only judge people by how they seem on the outside, you’ll get fooled a lot and be unhappy if you expect them to make you feel better or give you what you want. But if you look for Jesus in everything, you will find Him. If you only look for yourself, you will find trouble. Not looking for Jesus hurts you more than anything else in the world ever could.

Chapter Eight: Being Close Friends with Jesus

When Jesus is close, everything feels okay and nothing seems too hard. When He’s not near, everything feels tough. If Jesus doesn’t speak to your heart, nothing else can really comfort you, but if He says just one word, it brings great peace.

Remember how Mary Magdalene stopped crying as soon as she heard, “The Master is here and wants you”? That’s a happy moment when Jesus turns sadness into joy.

Without Jesus, life feels dry and empty. Wanting anything besides Him is silly and pointless. Losing Jesus is worse than losing the whole world. Because without Jesus, the world can’t really give you anything good. Life without Him is like being in a terrible place, but life with Him is like living in a beautiful paradise. If Jesus is with you, no enemy can hurt you.
