Oh, if these things really touched your heart, how could you ever complain even once? Shouldn't we accept all hardships for the chance of eternal life? Honestly, losing or gaining God’s kingdom is a big deal.

So, look up to heaven. See Me, and all My saints with Me.

They went through hard times in life, but now they are happy. They feel comforted. Now they are safe and at peace. They will stay with Me forever in My Father’s kingdom.

The Forty-Eighth Chapter  
THE DAY OF ETERNITY AND THE TROUBLES OF THIS LIFE  
THE DISCIPLE  

Oh, happy home in the city above! Oh, bright day of forever, a day never darkened by night, always lit by the highest truth! A day full of joy and safety, never changing for the worse! I wish this day would come soon, and all these temporary things would end! It shines brightly on the saints in heaven, but for us who wander on earth, it feels far away like looking through a glass. The people in heaven know how joyful that day is, but we, the exiled children of Eve, feel sad because this life is hard and slow.

The days we live now are short and full of trouble, sadness, and pain. People make many mistakes, get caught up in many feelings, are scared by many fears, and weighed down by many worries. We get distracted by too many things and trapped by useless stuff. We face many wrong ideas and get tired from working hard. We are tempted, weakened by pleasures, and suffer from not having enough.

Oh, when will these bad things stop? When will I be free from the bad habits that hold me down? When, Lord, will I think only of You? When will I truly be happy in You? When will I be free, without any problems for my mind and body?

When will there be real peace, safe and calm inside and outside? Oh good Jesus, when will I stand and look at You? When will I see the glory of Your kingdom? When will You be everything to me? Oh, when will I be with You in the kingdom You made for Your loved ones forever?

I am poor and far away in a hard place, where every day there are fights and big troubles. Please comfort me and ease my sadness. All I want is You. Anything this world gives me feels heavy. I want to be close to You, but I can’t reach it. I want to hold on to heavenly things, but this world and my own feelings pull me down. I want to be above everything in my mind, but my body forces me to be stuck with them. So, I fight inside myself, feeling unhappy and like a burden, while my spirit wants to rise up and my body wants to fall down. Oh, how much I suffer inside when I think about heaven; when I pray, many distracting thoughts rush in!

Oh my God, don’t stay far from me or be angry with Your servant. Shoot Your lightning and chase them away; send Your arrows and make the enemy’s tricks run away.
