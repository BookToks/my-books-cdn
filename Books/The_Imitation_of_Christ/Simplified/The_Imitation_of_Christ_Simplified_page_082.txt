Always try to come to Me, who knows what’s really in people’s hearts. Don’t get confused by every rumor or story you hear. Instead, want everything—inside you and around you—to happen the way I want.

It’s really helpful to avoid looking for attention from others. Don’t try to show off or do things just to get people to admire you. Instead, focus hard on doing what helps you grow and become a better person. Many people have gotten hurt because they showed off their good qualities too quickly. It’s much better when your kindness and goodness stay quiet during this life, which is full of challenges and struggles.

Chapter Forty-Six: TRUST GOD WHEN OTHERS TALK BAD ABOUT YOU

My child, stand strong and trust Me. Words are just words—they fly around but can’t really hurt you. If you’ve done something wrong, think about how you can fix it. If you haven’t, be ready to accept being treated unfairly for God’s sake. It’s not hard to handle mean words now, since you’re not ready for bigger problems yet.

Why do small things bother you so much? It’s because you still care too much about what people think. You don’t like being told you’re wrong and try to make excuses because you’re scared to be looked down on. But if you look deeper inside, you’ll see you still want people to like you. If you don’t want to be embarrassed or criticized, that shows you’re not truly humble or free from caring about the world.

Listen to what I say, and you won’t care about thousands of people’s words. Imagine if everyone said the worst things possible about you—would it really hurt if you ignored it like a blade of grass? Could it even pull out one hair from your head?

People who don’t keep their hearts focused on Me and don’t have God in their minds get easily upset by mean words. But those who trust Me and don’t rely on their own opinions won’t be afraid of what others say. I am the one who judges and understands all secrets. I know everything that happens, who hurts and who gets hurt. Those words came from Me, and I allowed them so that people’s true thoughts can be shown. I will judge both the guilty and the innocent, but first, I test them quietly.

People’s stories aren’t always true, but My judgment is true and will never be wrong. Many don’t see this, and only a few understand it. Even if it looks unfair to some, it can’t be wrong.

So always come to Me when you have to make a choice, not trusting only yourself. A good person won’t be shaken no matter what happens from God.
