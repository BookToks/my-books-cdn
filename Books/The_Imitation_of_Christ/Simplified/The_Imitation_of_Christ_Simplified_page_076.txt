Without this, no good relationship can last or will last.

I’ve told you many times, and I’ll say it again: forget about yourself, give up your selfishness, and you will find great peace inside. Give everything without expecting anything back. Trust me completely and without doubt, and you will truly have me.

Your heart will be free, and darkness won’t take over you.

Work hard for this, pray for this, want this—to get rid of all selfishness and follow Jesus openly, to stop living for yourself and live forever for me. Then all useless worries, bad thoughts, and extra cares will disappear. Also, too much fear will leave you, and unhealthy love will die.

The Thirty-Eighth Chapter THE RIGHT WAY TO HANDLE OUTSIDE THINGS; TURN TO GOD IN TROUBLE

My child, you must work hard to be free inside, to control yourself in everything you do, so that everything serves you and not the other way around. You should be the boss of your actions, not a slave or just someone doing a job. You should be a free person, like a true child of God, who looks beyond this world to what lasts forever. You see temporary things with one eye and things of heaven with the other. You don’t get stuck on temporary stuff but use it properly as God, the great Creator, planned.

Also, don’t be satisfied with just what you see on the outside. Don’t look at things with only your physical eyes. Instead, like Moses, go inside your heart to ask God for advice in every situation. Sometimes you’ll hear God’s answer and learn a lot about now and the future. Moses always went to the tabernacle to find answers and prayed for help in danger and from bad people. You should do the same—go to the quiet place in your heart and ask God for help.

That’s why, as we read, Joshua and the people of Israel were tricked by the Gibeonites because they didn’t first ask God for advice. They trusted too much in nice words and were fooled by fake holiness.
