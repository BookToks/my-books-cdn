Because he loved God more than people, he chose God’s happiness over human comfort. You should also learn to let go of a close and important friend for the love of God. Don’t feel too sad if a friend leaves you, because in the end, we all have to say goodbye to each other.

A person has to struggle hard against their own feelings before they can fully control themselves and focus all their love on God. When someone trusts themselves, it’s easy to rely on comfort from others. But a true follower of Christ, who really wants to be good, doesn’t look for comfort or fun things. Instead, they choose to face tough challenges and hard work for Christ’s sake.

So, when God gives you spiritual comfort, accept it with thanks. Remember it’s a gift from Him, not something you earned. Don’t get too excited or proud. Instead, be humble and careful in everything you do, because this feeling won’t last forever and hard times will come again.

When that comfort goes away, don’t lose hope right away. Be patient and wait quietly for God to visit you again, because He can give you even more comfort later.

This is not strange for anyone who knows how God works, because many great saints and prophets have gone through this too. One of them said, "When I was doing well, I thought I would never be shaken." But when God’s grace left him, he said, "You hid Your face, and I was troubled." He didn’t give up; instead, he prayed more, saying, "I will cry out to You, Lord, and ask for help." In the end, God answered him and helped him, turning his sadness into joy.

If this happened to great saints, then we who are weak should not give up just because sometimes we feel strong and sometimes weak. The Holy Spirit comes and goes as He wants. Job, a holy man, said, "You visit him early in the morning and test him suddenly." So, what can I hope for or trust in except God’s great mercy and the promise of His grace? Even if I have good people around me, holy books, and beautiful songs, they don’t help much when God’s grace leaves me and I feel empty inside.

At these times, the best thing to do is to be patient and accept God’s will.

I have never met a truly religious and devoted person who hasn’t felt God’s grace go away sometimes or felt less passionate. No saint was ever so close to God that they didn’t face temptation before and after. In fact, anyone who hasn’t been tested by hard times for God’s sake is not ready for God’s highest blessings. Usually, temptation comes before comfort, and God promises comfort to everyone who has been tested.
