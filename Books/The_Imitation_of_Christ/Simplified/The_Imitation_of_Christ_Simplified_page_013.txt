Chapter Nine: Obedience and Following Rules

Obeying and living under someone in charge is really important. It’s safer to follow than to be the boss. Many people obey because they have to, not because they want to. These people get upset easily and won’t feel peaceful unless they obey fully out of love for God.

No matter where you go, you won’t find real rest except by humbly following authority. Many people think they’ll be happier if they change places, but that’s not true.

Everyone wants to do what they like and be around people who agree with them. But if God is with us, sometimes we have to give up our own ideas to have peace.

Also, who is so smart to know everything? Don’t trust your own opinions too much. Be ready to listen to others. Even if your idea is good, accepting someone else’s for God’s sake is better. I’ve heard it’s safer to listen and accept advice than to only give it. Sometimes refusing to agree with others shows pride and stubbornness.

Chapter Ten: Avoiding Gossip and Idle Talk

Try to avoid gossip as much as you can. Talking about worldly things, even if honest, distracts us because it makes us focus on pride.

Many times I wish I had stayed quiet and not talked with others.

Why do we gossip when it often leaves us feeling bad? We do it because we want to feel better by talking and to clear our tired minds. So, we talk about things we really like or really dislike. But sadly, this talking is often useless and stops us from feeling peace inside.

So, we need to be careful and pray so we don’t waste time.

When it’s the right time to speak, say something helpful.
