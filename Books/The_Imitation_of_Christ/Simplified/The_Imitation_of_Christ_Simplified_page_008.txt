Jesus tells us to copy His life and habits if we want to be truly wise and free from the blindness in our hearts. So, our main goal should be to learn about how Jesus lived.

Jesus’ teaching is better than all the advice from the saints, and if you have His spirit, you will find something very special in it. Many people hear the Gospel a lot but don’t care much because they don’t have Jesus’ spirit. But if you want to really understand Jesus’ words, you need to try to live like Him.

What’s the point of talking smart about God if you don’t have humility and end up upsetting Him? It’s not being smart that makes a person holy and good, but living a good life that pleases God. I would rather feel sorry for my mistakes than just know the definition of being sorry. What good is it to know the whole Bible and all the ideas of smart people if we don’t have God’s love and grace? Everything is empty and meaningless except loving God and serving only Him.

The smartest thing to do is to look for heaven by not caring about the world’s stuff. It’s useless to chase money that will disappear. It’s useless to want honor and be full of pride. It’s useless to follow selfish desires that will bring punishment later. It’s useless to want to live a long time but not care about living well. It’s useless to only care about now and not think about the future. It’s useless to love things that don’t last and not look forward to the happiness that lasts forever.

Remember this saying: “The eye is never satisfied with seeing, and the ear never gets enough of hearing.” Try to stop loving only what you can see and focus more on what you cannot see. People who follow their bad desires hurt their conscience and lose God’s grace.
