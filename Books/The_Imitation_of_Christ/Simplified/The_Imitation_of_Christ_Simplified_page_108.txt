Chapter Eight: Christ’s Sacrifice on the Cross and Our Offering

When I willingly gave Myself to God the Father for your sins, with My hands stretched out and My body naked on the cross, I became a complete sacrifice to calm God’s anger. In the same way, you should be ready to offer yourself to Me every day during Mass, pure and holy, with all your feelings and abilities, and with as much true devotion as you can.

What I want most is for you to give yourself fully to Me. I don’t care about anything else you might give, because I want you, not your gifts. Just like having everything means nothing if you don’t have Me, whatever you give won’t please Me unless you give yourself.

So, give yourself to Me completely and offer yourself fully to God—your offering will be accepted. Remember, I gave Myself fully to the Father for you, even giving My Body and Blood as food so I could be all yours, and you could be Mine forever.

But if you rely on yourself and don’t offer your free will to Mine, your offering won’t be complete, and our connection won’t be perfect. So, if you want to receive grace and true freedom in your heart, always offer yourself freely to God before you do anything. This is why so few people are truly free inside—they don’t know how to give themselves up completely.

My word is clear: "Anyone who does not give up everything they have cannot be My follower." If you want to be My follower, give yourself to Me with all your heart.

Chapter Nine: Offering Ourselves and Everything We Have to God, Praying for All Disciples

Everything in heaven and on earth belongs to You, Lord. I want to give myself to You freely, to be Yours forever. Today, with a sincere heart, I offer myself to You, Lord, to serve You forever, to honor You, and as a never-ending praise. Please accept me with this holy offering of Your precious Body, which I also offer to You today, in the presence of the angels who quietly watch, for my salvation and for all Your people.
