BOOK FOUR AN INVITATION TO HOLY COMMUNION THE VOICE OF CHRIST

Come to Me, all of you who are tired and carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. The bread I give is My Flesh, which gives life to the world. Take it and eat: this is My Body, given for you. Do this to remember Me. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood lives in Me, and I live in them. The words I have spoken to you are full of spirit and life.

THE FIRST CHAPTER THE GREAT RESPECT WE SHOULD HAVE WHEN RECEIVING CHRIST

DISCIPLE

All these words are Yours, O Christ, eternal Truth. Even though they were not all said at once or written in the same place, they are true because You said them. I must believe them and be thankful. They belong to You, and because You said them, they belong to me too, since You said them to save me.

I gladly accept Your words from Your mouth so they can stay deep in my heart.

Your words are so kind, full of love and sweetness, and they encourage me. But my sins scare me, and my guilty conscience worries me when I think about coming close to these great mysteries. Your sweet words invite me, but my many faults make me feel heavy.

You tell me to come to You with confidence if I want to be close to You, and to receive the food that gives eternal life and glory.

"You say, 'Come to me, all you who are tired and carrying heavy loads, and I will give you rest.'"
