What is our life, compared to theirs? The saints and friends of Christ served God even when they were hungry, thirsty, cold, or naked. They worked hard, stayed awake at night, fasted, prayed, and thought deeply about God. They faced many troubles — the Apostles, martyrs, confessors, virgins, and all who wanted to follow Jesus! They didn’t care about their life on earth because they wanted to live forever with God.

The holy hermits lived very simple and strict lives in the desert. They faced many serious temptations and were often attacked by the enemy.

They prayed to God a lot and fasted strictly. They were very passionate and wanted to become spiritually perfect. They fought hard to overcome bad habits. They were honest and pure in their love for God. During the day, they worked, and at night, they prayed for a long time. Even while working, they kept thinking about God. They used every moment wisely; they felt there was never enough time to serve God, and while thinking about God, they forgot about their own needs.

They gave up all riches, honors, friends, and comforts. They wanted nothing from the world. They barely took care of their own bodies and found it hard even to do that. They were poor in material things but rich in goodness and grace. Even though they looked poor on the outside, inside they were full of God’s love and comfort. They stayed away from the world but were very close to God. They thought little of themselves and were ignored by others, but God loved them very much. They lived humbly and obeyed simply. They were kind and patient, growing every day in their spiritual life and gaining God’s great favor.

They are examples for all religious people, and their example should inspire us to be better, more than lazy people tempt us to be careless.

At the start of their holy communities, all religious people were very passionate!

They prayed with great devotion and competed to be more virtuous. They had strong discipline and showed great respect and obedience to their leaders. Their actions still prove that they were holy and brave men who defeated the world’s temptations.

Today, anyone who just doesn’t break the rules and can patiently do their duties is seen as great. We have become so lazy and careless!

We lose our original passion very quickly and even feel tired of life because of laziness! Don’t fall asleep in trying to be good, especially when you’ve seen so many examples of devoted people!

The life of a good religious person should be full of every virtue so that inside they are just like what others see on the outside. It makes sense that there should be much more goodness inside than we can see, because God sees everything inside us. We should respect God the most, wherever we are, and live pure in His sight like angels.
