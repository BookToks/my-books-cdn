Because of this, he feels sad when he has to give up what he wants; he gets angry quickly if someone criticizes him. But if he gives in to his desires, he feels guilty afterward because following his feelings didn’t bring him the peace he wanted.

Real peace comes from resisting these strong feelings, not from giving in to them.

A person who only cares about physical things and shallow attractions won’t find peace, but someone who is passionate and spiritual will.

The Seventh Chapter: AVOIDING FALSE HOPE AND PRIDE

It’s useless to trust in people or things made by humans.

Don’t be embarrassed to help others because you love Jesus or to seem poor in this world. Don’t think you can do everything on your own—trust God. Do what you can, and God will help your good intentions. Don’t trust only your own knowledge or anyone else’s cleverness, but trust God’s grace, who helps humble people and humbles those who are proud.

If you have money, don’t brag about it or about having powerful friends. Be thankful to God, who gives everything and wants to give Himself the most. Don’t boast about how you look or your physical strength because sickness can spoil these things easily. Don’t be proud of your talents or skills because they are gifts from God.

Don’t think you’re better than others, or you might be seen as worse by God, who knows what’s in your heart. Don’t be proud of your good actions, because God judges differently than people do, and what people like might not please God. If you see good in yourself, look for even more good in others to stay humble. Thinking less of yourself than others doesn’t hurt you, but thinking you’re better than anyone can cause harm. Humble people live in peace, but proud people often feel jealous and angry.

The Eighth Chapter: AVOIDING BEING TOO CLOSE TO EVERYONE

Don’t share your deepest thoughts with just anyone. Talk about important things only with someone wise and who respects God. Avoid hanging out too much with young people you don’t know well or strangers. Don’t try to impress rich people or spend a lot of time with important people. Instead, spend time with humble, simple, and good people and talk about things that help you grow. Don’t get too close to any woman, but pray for all good women. Try to be close only to God and His angels, and avoid seeking attention from others.

We should care for everyone, but being too familiar with everyone isn’t a good idea.

Sometimes, people think others like them because they have a good reputation with strangers, but the people who know them well might not respect them. We often think others like us by just being around, but our faults can actually annoy them.
