But why would You come to me? Who am I that You would offer Yourself to me? How can a sinner like me stand in front of You, and how can You choose to come to a sinner? You know me, and You know I don’t deserve this.

So, I admit I’m not worthy. I recognize Your goodness. I thank You for Your kindness and love. You do this because of who You are, not because of anything I’ve done; so I can understand Your goodness better, love You more, and become more humble. Since this is what You want, I’m happy about it too. I just hope my sins don’t get in the way!

Oh, sweetest and kindest Jesus, You deserve so much respect, thanks, and endless praise for letting us take Your holy body, something no one can truly explain how special it is!

But what should I think about when I receive Communion, when I come close to my Lord? I can never honor You enough, but I really want to receive You with all my heart. What better thought is there than to be completely humble before You and to praise Your endless goodness above myself?

I praise You, my God, forever! I look down on myself and come before You knowing I’m unworthy. You are holy, and I am a sinner! Yet You humble Yourself to come to someone like me who can barely look up to You!

Look, You come to me! You want to be with me! You invite me to Your special meal! You want to give me heavenly food—the Bread of Angels—which is actually Yourself, the living Bread who came down from heaven to give life to the world.

Look how much love this shows! How kind You are! You deserve so much thanks and praise for this! How good and helpful Your idea was to give Yourself as food! How sweet and wonderful is this meal You give!

How amazing is what You do, Lord! How powerful You are! How true Your words are! You spoke, and everything was made. What You commanded happened. It’s amazing and hard to understand, but true—that You, my God, true God and man, are fully present under the simple forms of bread and wine, and don’t get used up when someone eats You!

You, the Lord of everything, who don’t need anything, chose to live inside us through this Sacrament. Please keep my heart and body clean, so I can joyfully and purely celebrate Your mysteries often and receive what You have prepared for my salvation, honoring You forever.
