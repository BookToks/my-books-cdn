Many people travel a long way to honor the relics of saints, amazed by their amazing deeds and the beautiful shrines built for them. They look at and kiss the sacred relics wrapped in silk and gold; and they feel, You are here with me on the altar, my God, Saint of saints, Creator of people, and Lord of angels!

Often, when people see these things, they are just curious or excited by something new, and they don’t really change their lives. Especially if they just visit different places without truly feeling sorry or serious. But here, in the Sacrament on the altar, You are fully present, my God, Jesus Christ, and through You we receive the full gift of eternal salvation, whenever we receive You with respect and faith. We come not out of silliness, curiosity, or wanting pleasure, but with strong faith, hope, and real love.

O God, hidden Creator of the world, You treat us so wonderfully! You kindly offer Yourself to be received in this Sacrament by those You have chosen! This is beyond what we can understand.

This special gift attracts the hearts of faithful people and fills them with love. Your true followers, who want to change their lives, often receive great grace and love for goodness during Holy Communion.

Oh, the amazing and hidden power of this Sacrament is only understood by Jesus’ faithful followers. Those who don’t believe or live in sin can’t feel it! It gives spiritual grace, restores lost goodness, and heals the damage caused by sin. Sometimes, its grace is so strong that not only the mind but even the weak body feels stronger because of it.

Still, it is sad and pitiful how often we ignore this and are cold-hearted, not eager to receive Christ, who is the hope and reward for everyone who will be saved. He makes us holy and saves us. He comforts us now and will bring us eternal happiness in heaven. Because this is true, it’s sad that many people don’t pay much attention to this holy Mystery that fills heaven with joy and keeps the whole universe going.

Oh, how blind and hard-hearted people are when they don’t appreciate such a wonderful gift and instead become careless because they see it every day! If this holy Sacrament happened in only one place and was celebrated by only one priest in the whole world, how eager do you think people would be to come there and watch the holy ceremony! But now there are many priests and Mass is said in many places so that God’s grace and love can be shown more clearly as Holy Communion is shared all over the world.

Thank You, Jesus, Good Shepherd forever, for feeding us poor people with Your precious Body and Blood, and inviting us with Your own words to take part in these holy Mysteries: "Come to Me, all you who work hard and are tired, and I will give you rest."  

I trust in Your goodness and mercy, Lord. I come like someone sick to the Healer, like someone hungry and thirsty to the Fountain of life, like someone who needs help to the King of heaven, as a servant to my Lord, a creature to my Creator, a soul in sadness to my gentle Comforter.
