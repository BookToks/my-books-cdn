The priest is God’s helper, using God’s word as He has told him to. God is always there — the main Creator and invisible Worker, who controls everything and everyone obeys Him.

In this special Sacrament, you should trust God more than your own feelings or anything you can see. So, come close with respect and awe. Think about who gave you this role by placing hands on you — the bishop’s hands.

Look! You have become a priest, chosen to celebrate Mass! Now make sure you offer sacrifices to God faithfully and at the right times, and live a good, blameless life. Your job is not easier now; instead, you have more rules to follow and must be even holier.

A priest should have all good qualities and be a role model for others. He shouldn’t live like ordinary people but aim to be like angels and perfect people on earth. Wearing special clothes, the priest acts for Christ, praying to God for himself and everyone else, humbly asking for help.

He has the sign of the Lord’s cross in front and behind him. The cross in front reminds him of Christ’s suffering, which he should follow closely. The cross behind him reminds him to be ready to suffer for God if others cause problems.

The cross in front helps him feel sorry for his own sins, and the cross behind helps him feel sorry for others’ sins. He knows he must stand between God and sinners, never giving up on praying and offering until he receives God’s grace and mercy.

When the priest celebrates Mass, he honors God, makes the angels happy, strengthens the Church, helps people who are alive, brings peace to those who have died, and gains blessings for himself.

When I think about how holy You are, Lord, and how weak I am, I get scared and confused. If I don’t receive Communion, I lose life, but if I receive it unworthily, I upset You. So, what should I do, my God and helper? Teach me the right way. Show me a simple prayer or practice to get my heart ready to receive Your Sacrament with respect and true feeling, so it helps my soul or even helps me celebrate this great sacrifice.
