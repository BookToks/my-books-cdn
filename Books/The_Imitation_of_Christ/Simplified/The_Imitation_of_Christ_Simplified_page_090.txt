It doesn’t mix with outside things or with comfort from the world. Get rid of anything that blocks grace if you want to receive it.

Try to spend time alone inside yourself. Like being by yourself. Don’t look for people to talk to, but instead pray to God so your mind stays humble and your heart stays clean.

Think of the whole world as nothing special. Choose to be with God more than doing anything else, because you can’t focus on Me and enjoy outside things at the same time. You need to stay away from friends and acquaintances and keep your mind free from temporary comfort. That’s why St. Peter tells Christians to live like strangers and travelers in this world. Someone who isn’t attached to the world will feel strong and confident when they die. But weak souls don’t know what it’s like to be separate from everything, and people who only think naturally don’t understand the freedom spiritual people have. But if you want to be spiritual, you must give up both strangers and friends and be most careful about yourself.

If you fully control yourself, it will be easier to control everything else.

The greatest win is to overcome yourself. If you can make your desires listen to your reason, and your reason listen to Me in everything, then you really control yourself and the world.

If you want to reach this high level, start seriously and cut out any secret selfish love for yourself or for things of this world. Most bad habits come from loving yourself too much. When you beat this bad habit and control it, you will feel great peace right away.

But since most people don’t try hard to fully die to themselves or stop thinking about themselves, they stay stuck and can’t raise their spirit above themselves.

Anyone who wants to be free with Me must kill all their selfish feelings and not hold onto any person or thing with selfish love or desire.

MY CHILD, pay close attention to the feelings of nature and grace, because they act very differently and are hard to tell apart.
