It is there You show me who I really am—what I’ve been and what I’m becoming; I didn’t even know that I was nothing. Left on my own, I am completely weak. But if You look at me for just a moment, I instantly feel strong and filled with new happiness. It’s amazing that I, who normally sink down because of my own weight, am suddenly lifted up and kindly held by You.

It is Your love that does this. You kindly hold me up, help me when I need it, protect me from many dangers, and save me from countless troubles. When I loved myself in the wrong way, I lost who I was; but by looking only to You and truly loving You, I have found both myself and You. And through that love, I have become even more humble. You, my sweet Lord, treat me better than I deserve, beyond anything I could hope or ask for.

Thank You, my God, because even though I don’t deserve any gifts, Your kindness and goodness never stop doing good things for people, even for those who don’t appreciate You or are far from You. Please change us so we can be thankful, humble, and devoted, because You are our salvation, our courage, and our strength.

The Ninth Chapter: ALL THINGS SHOULD BE ABOUT GOD IN THE END

My child, I must be your ultimate goal if you really want to be happy. When you think this way, your feelings—which often focus the wrong way on yourself or other things—will become pure. If you only think about yourself, you will fail inside and feel empty.

So, put everything first with Me, because I gave you everything.

Think about everything as coming from the greatest good, and so all things must go back to Me, their highest source.

From Me, both the poor and the rich get the water of life like from a living fountain. Those who serve Me happily will receive grace again and again. But if someone wants to take pride in things without Me, or enjoy good things as if they belong to them alone, they won’t find true joy or happiness. Instead, they will feel burdened and upset in many ways. So, you shouldn’t take credit for any good or praise any person, but give all glory to God, because without Him, people have nothing.

I have given everything. I want it all to be returned to Me, and I expect to be thanked. This is the truth that stops pride.

Where God’s grace and true love exist, there is no envy, selfishness, or narrow-mindedness. God’s love wins over everything and makes the soul stronger and bigger.
