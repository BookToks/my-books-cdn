Remember why you started this journey and think about Jesus on the cross. Even if you’ve been trying to follow God for a long time, you should feel ashamed if, with Jesus’ example in front of you, you don’t try harder to be like Him.

If someone focuses deeply and sincerely on Jesus’ life and suffering, they will find everything they need in Him. They don’t have to look for anything better than Jesus.

If Jesus came into our hearts, we would learn so much, so fast!

A religious person who cares deeply does what they’re told and does it well. But someone lazy and careless has problems all the time and feels empty inside because they can’t find comfort inside themselves or outside either. A religious person who doesn’t follow their rules risks serious trouble, and anyone who wants to be free and do whatever they want will always be unhappy because something will always bother them.

How do many religious people who live in strict communities manage? They rarely leave, spend time thinking about God, eat simple food, wear plain clothes, work hard, talk little, stay up late praying, get up early, pray a lot, read often, and follow strict rules. Think about groups like the Carthusians and Cistercians, monks and nuns who get up every night to sing praises to God. It would be embarrassing if you got lazy in serving God, especially when so many others are already happy praising Him.

If all you had to do was praise God with your heart and voice, and never had to eat, drink, or sleep, but only focus on spiritual things, you would be much happier than you are now, stuck dealing with your body’s needs! It would be great if we didn’t need those things and could always enjoy the soul’s spiritual refreshment, which sadly, we rarely do.

When someone stops looking for comfort from anyone else, they start to truly enjoy God. Then, no matter what happens, they feel okay. They won’t get too excited about good things or too upset about small problems. They will fully trust God, who is everything to them, who never dies or disappears, and who controls everything as He wants.

Always remember your final goal and don’t forget that lost time can’t be gotten back.

Without care and effort, you won’t gain goodness. When you start to get lazy, that’s the start of bad things; but if you work hard and stay passionate, you’ll find peace and have fewer problems thanks to God’s help and love for doing what’s right.

A passionate and hardworking person is ready for anything. It takes more effort to fight bad habits than to work hard physically. If you don’t fix small mistakes, you will slowly fall into bigger ones.

If you spend your day well, you’ll feel happy at the end. Watch yourself, wake yourself up, warn yourself, and no matter what happens to others, don’t forget about yourself. The more you push yourself, the more you will improve.
