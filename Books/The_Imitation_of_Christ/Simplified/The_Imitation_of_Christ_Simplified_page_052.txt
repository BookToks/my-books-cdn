If you are truly wise, you will be happy only in Me, because no one is good except God alone, Who should be praised and blessed above everything.

The Tenth Chapter: To Ignore the World and Serve God Is Sweet

The disciple speaks again. Lord, I will talk and not be silent. I will speak to my God, my Lord, and my King in heaven. Oh Lord, how great is the kindness You have saved for those who love You. But what are You to those who love You? What are You to those who serve You with all their heart?

The joy You give to those who love You is beyond words. You have shown me the sweetness of Your love, especially by making me when I didn’t exist, by bringing me back to serve You when I had gone far away, and by telling me to love You.

Oh Source of never-ending love, what can I say about You? How can I forget You, Who still remember me even when I was lost and broken?

You have shown mercy to me beyond all hope, and given me grace and friendship I don’t deserve.

What can I give You back for this kindness? Not everyone can give up everything, leave the world behind, and live a religious life. Is it a big thing that I serve You, when every creature is meant to serve You? It shouldn’t seem like much; instead, it’s amazing that You accept someone as poor and unworthy as me to serve You. Everything belongs to You, even what I have and use to serve You. Heaven and earth, which You made to serve people, are ready and do what You command every day. But even that is small, because You have angels to help people—and more than that—You Yourself have chosen to serve people and promised to give Yourself to them.

What can I give for all these thousands of gifts? I wish I could serve You every day of my life! I wish I could serve You even one day in a worthy way!

You truly deserve all service, honor, and endless praise. You are my Lord, and I am Your poor servant, ready to serve You with all my strength, praising You without getting tired. This is what I want to do—this is my wish. Please help me with whatever I lack.

It is a great honor and glory to serve You and to ignore everything else because of You. Those who gladly give themselves to Your holy service will receive great grace. Those who give up all worldly pleasures for Your love will find the sweetest comfort from the Holy Spirit. Those who choose the hard path for Your name and leave worldly worries behind will find great peace of mind.

Oh sweet and joyful service to God, which makes a person truly free and holy! Oh holy life of serving God, which makes a person like the angels, makes God happy, scares away evil spirits, and earns the respect of all believers! Oh service that should be wanted and loved forever, where the greatest good is given and joy is found that will never end!
