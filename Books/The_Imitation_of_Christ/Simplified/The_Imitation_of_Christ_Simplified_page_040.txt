Then he will truly feel poor and empty inside, and like the prophet, he may say, "I am alone and poor." But no one is richer, stronger, or freer than the person who can let go of everything and see themselves as the least of all.

The Twelfth Chapter THE ROYAL ROAD OF THE HOLY CROSS

For many people, the saying "Give up what you want, carry your cross, and follow Me" sounds really hard. But it will be even harder to hear the final words: "Go away, cursed, into eternal fire." Those who accept the cross and follow it now don’t need to be scared of this judgment day. When the Lord comes to judge, the sign of the cross will be in the sky. Then everyone who lived with the cross and followed Jesus will come confidently to Him.

So why are you scared to carry your cross when doing so can win you a kingdom? In the cross, there is salvation, life, protection from enemies, heavenly sweetness, strength of mind, joy in your spirit, the best kind of goodness, and perfect holiness.

There is no saving your soul or hope for eternal life without the cross.

So take up your cross and follow Jesus, and you will get eternal life.

Jesus showed the way by carrying His own cross and dying on it for you. He wants you to carry your cross too and be ready to die for Him. If you die with Him, you will live with Him. If you share His suffering, you will share His glory.

Look, everything is in the cross, and your life depends on how you handle dying on it. There is no other way to true peace and life except the way of the holy cross and dying to yourself every day. No matter where you go or what you do, you will always have some kind of suffering to deal with, whether you want it or not. So you will always have a cross to carry.

You might feel physical pain or have troubles in your soul. Sometimes God might feel far away, sometimes people around you will bother you, and worst of all, you might get tired of yourself. You can’t run away or fix it with anything else; you have to accept it as long as God allows.

God wants you to learn how to handle hard times without always feeling better, so you can fully give yourself to Him and become more humble through suffering. No one understands Jesus’ suffering better than the person who has suffered like He did.
