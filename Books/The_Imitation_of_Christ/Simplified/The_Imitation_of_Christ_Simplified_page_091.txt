Only a man who is spiritual and understands himself inside can truly see this. Everyone wants good things and tries to do good through their words and actions. Because of this, many people are tricked by things that only look good.

Nature is sneaky and attracts many people, trapping and fooling them while always looking out for itself. But grace is simple, avoids anything that looks bad, doesn’t trick anyone, and does everything purely for God, who is its ultimate goal.

Nature doesn’t want to die, be controlled, or lose. It won’t calm itself or be made to obey. Grace, on the other hand, wants to control itself and die to selfish desires.

Grace fights against pleasure, wants to obey, hopes to be controlled, doesn’t want to use its freedom for itself, loves discipline, and doesn’t want to rule others. Instead, it wants to live, stand strong, and always be under God, willing to humbly serve every person for God’s sake.

Nature works for itself and looks for what it can get from others.

Grace doesn’t think about what helps itself but cares about what helps many people. Nature likes being honored and respected, but grace gives all honor and glory to God. Nature is afraid of shame and being looked down on, but grace is glad to suffer for Jesus’s name. Nature loves comfort and rest.

Grace, however, can’t stand doing nothing and gladly works hard. Nature wants rare and beautiful things and dislikes cheap or rough stuff. Grace enjoys simple and humble things, doesn’t hate roughness, and doesn’t mind wearing old clothes.

Nature cares about money and is happy about gaining things on earth. It gets sad when it loses something and upset by harsh words. Grace looks to forever things and doesn’t hold on to temporary stuff. It isn’t bothered by loss or mean words because it treasures and finds joy in heaven where nothing is lost.

Nature is greedy and likes taking more than giving. It loves having private stuff. Grace is kind and open. Grace avoids selfishness, is happy with little, and believes giving is better than receiving.

Nature wants to be around people, its own body, fun things, and to be busy. But grace draws close to God and goodness, avoids worldly things, hates selfish desires, controls its actions, and feels shy when seen in public.

Nature likes comfort it can enjoy with its senses, but grace looks for comfort only in God, finding joy in the highest and best things, above anything you can see.

Nature does everything for itself and wants to be paid back or praised for good deeds. It wants people to think well of its gifts and actions. Grace wants nothing of this world and only asks God for what is needed to get eternal life.

Nature is happy to have many friends and family, boasts about noble birth, flatters the powerful, praises the rich, and sticks with people like itself. Grace loves even enemies and isn’t proud of having many friends. It doesn’t care much about status or birth unless the person is also good. Grace prefers the poor over the rich.
