Your cell will feel special to you if you stay in it, but if you don’t, it will feel tiring. At the start of your religious life, if you stay in your cell and stick to it, it will soon become a good friend and a big comfort.

In silence and calm, a devoted soul grows in goodness and learns the hidden meanings of Scripture. There, she finds many tears to wash and clean herself every night, so she can feel closer to her Creator the more she stays away from the noisy world. God and His holy angels come close to those who stay away from friends and others.

It’s better to be unknown and focus on saving your soul than to ignore it and do amazing things. It’s good for a religious person to rarely go out, avoid being seen by others, and not want to see them.

Why want to see what you can’t have? “The world and its desires pass away.” Sometimes your body wants to go out, but after, what do you get except a troubled mind and a heavy heart? Fun times often end in sadness, happy nights in gloomy mornings. All physical pleasures start sweet but end with regret and pain.

What can you find outside your cell that you can’t find inside? Look at heaven, earth, and everything around—they are all made from the same things. What can you see under the sun that will last? You might think you’ll be fully happy, but you can’t be, because even if you see everything, it’s just an empty show.

Look up to God in heaven and pray for your sins and mistakes. Leave silly things to silly people. Focus on what God has told you to do. Close the door and call Jesus, your Beloved, to you. Stay with Him in your cell because nowhere else will you find such peace. If you hadn’t left it or listened to useless gossip, you would have stayed more peaceful. But since you sometimes like to hear news, it’s right that you feel sadness from it.

If you want to grow in goodness, live in respect of the Lord, don’t expect too much freedom, control your senses, and avoid foolish things. Sadness can open the way to many blessings that wild behavior usually destroys.

It’s amazing that anyone who thinks about their hard life and the many dangers to their soul can ever be truly happy here. Careless and ignoring our faults, we don’t feel the real sadness in our souls and often laugh when we should cry. True freedom and true joy only come from fearing the Lord and having a clear conscience.

Happy is the person who can let go of all worries and think deeply with a sorry heart. Happy is the person who throws away everything that can hurt or weigh down their conscience.
