THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
I have been teaching prophets from the very beginning, and even now I keep speaking to everyone. But many people don’t listen. Many ignore My voice. Most people pay more attention to the world than to God. They want to follow what feels good instead of what God wants. The world offers small, temporary things, and people chase after them eagerly. I offer great and eternal things, but people’s hearts become dull. Who really serves and obeys Me with as much care as they serve the world and its leaders?

"Be ashamed, Sidon, because even the sea speaks." If you want to know why, listen: for a small reward, people will travel far; but for eternal life, many barely move. They want a little prize, and sometimes fight badly in court over a small amount of money. They will work day and night for something worthless or empty. But for something good that never changes, for a reward beyond value, for the highest honor and eternal glory, it’s sad to say that people don’t want to even try. Be ashamed, lazy and complaining servant, that people are more eager to ruin themselves than you are to live. They find more joy in useless things than you do in truth.

Sometimes their hopes fail them, but My promises never fail, and I never turn away anyone who trusts Me. What I promise, I will give. What I say, I will make happen, if a person stays faithful and loves Me until the end. I reward all who do good and strongly support those who are devoted to Me.

Write My words in your heart and think about them carefully, because you will need them when you face hard times. What you don’t understand now will become clear when I come to you. I usually visit My chosen people in two ways — through hard times and through comfort. Every day I teach them two lessons — one that corrects their wrongs, and one that encourages them to grow in goodness. Anyone who has My words but ignores them will be condemned at the end.

A PRAYER FOR THE GRACE OF DEVOTION  
O Lord my God, You are my only good. Who am I to even talk to You? I am Your poorest, lowest servant, worse than I even know or dare to say. But please remember me, Lord, because I am nothing, have nothing, and can do nothing. You alone are good, just, and holy. You can do everything, give everything, and fill everything. Only sinners You leave empty. Remember Your kindness and fill my heart with Your grace, You who never let Your work be wasted. How can I live this hard life without Your mercy and grace to comfort me? Don’t turn away from me. Don’t delay coming to help me. Don’t stop comforting me, or my soul will become like dry, empty land. Teach me, Lord, to do Your will. Teach me to live worthily and humbly before You, because You are my wisdom. You know me perfectly, and You knew me even before the world was made and before I was born.
