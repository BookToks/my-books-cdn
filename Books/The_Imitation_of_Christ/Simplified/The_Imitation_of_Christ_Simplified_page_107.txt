Chapter Seven: Checking Your Conscience and Deciding to Change

First of all, God’s priest should come to this special celebration and receive the Sacrament with a humble heart, full of respect, faith, and a true desire to honor God.

So, take a good look at your conscience. Try your best to clean it by feeling sorry for your sins and confessing them honestly. This way, you won’t feel guilty or weighed down, and you can come close to God freely. Remember all your sins and feel sad about them, especially the mistakes you make every day. If you have time, quietly tell God in your heart about all the problems your desires have caused.

Feel sorry because you are still too focused on the world, your own feelings, and selfish desires. You often don’t control your senses, waste time on silly thoughts, care too much about outside things and not enough about what’s inside you. You laugh and have fun too much and don’t feel sad enough for your mistakes. You like comfort and pleasure but don’t work hard or show strong faith. You’re curious about new things and pretty things but don’t accept being humble or sad easily. You want lots of things but don’t like giving, and you hold on too tightly to what you have. You talk too much, don’t stay quiet enough, act without discipline, and make a mess with your actions. You eat too much, don’t listen to God enough, rest too much, and don’t work hard enough. You enjoy useless chat but are sleepy during prayer times and want to finish them fast. You lose focus, don’t say prayers carefully, celebrate without much feeling, receive Communion without heart, get distracted quickly, rarely stay fully focused, get angry fast, take offense easily, judge others, and are too harsh in blaming people. You’re happy when things go well but weak when they don’t. You make good promises but hardly ever keep them.

After you have confessed these faults and feel really sorry because of your weakness, decide for sure to change your life little by little and become better. Then, with full trust, offer yourself completely to God, like a sacrifice from your heart. Give both your body and soul to God’s care, so you can be worthy to come close, offer a sacrifice to God, and receive the Sacrament of His Body in a good way. There is no better gift or stronger way to wash away sin than to give yourself fully to God while receiving the Body of Christ in Mass and Communion.

If someone really tries and is truly sorry, no matter how many times they ask Me for forgiveness, “As I live,” says the Lord, “I don’t want the wicked to die but to turn away from their sins and live.” I will forget their sins and forgive them all.
