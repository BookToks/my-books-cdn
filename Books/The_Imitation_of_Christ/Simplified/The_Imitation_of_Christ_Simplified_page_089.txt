You will say: the hard times we go through now don’t even compare to the amazing future that will be shown to us.

A MAN SHOULD NOT THINK HE DESERVES COMFORT, BUT RATHER PUNISHMENT

Lord, I don’t deserve Your comfort or any spiritual help.

So it’s fair if You leave me feeling empty and alone. Even if I cried a lot, I still wouldn’t deserve Your comfort. I only deserve punishment because I have hurt You many times and sinned in big ways. It’s only right that I don’t get any comfort.

But You, kind and merciful God, who doesn’t want Your work to be lost, please comfort me even though I don’t deserve it. Show me how good You are to those who need mercy. Your comfort is nothing like what people say.

Lord, what have I done to deserve any heavenly comfort? I remember I haven’t done anything good, and I’ve often sinned and been slow to change. That’s true. I can’t lie about it. If I did, You would be against me, and no one could help me. What do I deserve for my sins except hell and eternal fire?

I admit I deserve all the blame and hate. I don’t even deserve to be called one of Your faithful servants. Even though it’s hard for me to say this, I’ll confess my sins so I can better ask for Your mercy. What can I say, guilty and confused? I can only say: “I have sinned, Lord, I have sinned; please have mercy on me and forgive me. Let me grieve a little before I go to that dark place covered in death.” What do You want from a guilty sinner but to feel sorry and be humble? When someone is truly sorry and humble, hope for forgiveness grows, their troubled heart finds peace, grace comes, they are saved from punishment, and God and the sinner are reunited in a holy way.

To You, Lord, being truly sorry for sins is a gift You like, even better than sweet incense. It’s like a special ointment You would want poured on Your feet because You never reject a humble heart. This is a safe place from the enemy’s anger. Here, all the dirt from sin is wiped away.

GOD’S GRACE IS NOT GIVEN TO THOSE WHO ONLY THINK ABOUT EARTHLY THINGS

The voice of Christ: My child, my grace is precious.
