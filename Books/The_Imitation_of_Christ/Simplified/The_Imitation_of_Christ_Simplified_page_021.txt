Let’s try to get ready for death in a better way.

Jesus said, “Blessed is the servant whose master finds him watching when he comes. I tell you, he will put him in charge of everything he owns.” 

Find a good time to relax and think about God’s kindness. Don’t worry about things that don’t matter. Read things that might make you feel sad instead of just busy. If you stop talking too much and avoid gossip and rumors, you’ll have more time to think about God.

Many saints stayed away from people when they could and chose to serve God alone. One writer said, “Every time I’ve been around people, I felt less like myself.” We often feel this after long talks. It’s easier to stay quiet than to talk too much. It’s easier to stay home than to be careful all the time when you’re out. So, if you want to live a spiritual life, you need to be alone with Jesus, away from crowds.

No one is truly safe in public if they don’t first get used to being unknown.

No one is safe when talking if they don’t like being silent. No one leads well unless they can follow. No one commands well unless they know how to obey.

No one is truly happy unless they have a clear conscience.

Saints always stayed safe because they respected God; they stayed humble even when others saw their good qualities. Bad people feel safe because of pride, but that will fool them in the end.

Don’t ever think you’re completely safe in life, even if you seem very religious or holy. People who are highly respected often get into trouble because they trust themselves too much. Sometimes it’s better to face challenges often so you don’t become too proud or too comfortable.

If a person never looked for quick happiness or got caught up in worldly things, they would have a clear conscience. They would have great peace if they stopped worrying about useless stuff, thought only about God and what helps their soul, and trusted God completely.

No one deserves heaven’s comfort unless they keep feeling truly sorry for their sins. If you want real sadness for your mistakes, go somewhere private and shut out the noise of the world. As it says, “In your room, cry over your sins.” There, you will find what you often lose when you are outside.
