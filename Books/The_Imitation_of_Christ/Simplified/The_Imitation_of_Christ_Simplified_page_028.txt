Be careful and work hard in serving God. Often think about why you left the world and came here. Wasn’t it to live for God and become a spiritual person? Try your best to be perfect because soon you will get the reward for your hard work. At the time of death, you won’t feel fear or sadness.

Work a little now, and soon you will find great rest and true, never-ending happiness. If you stay faithful and work hard, God will surely be kind and reward you. Keep hoping to be saved, but don’t act like you are 100% sure, or you might get lazy and proud.

One day, a man who was unsure and worried about hope and fear felt very sad. He knelt down and prayed humbly in a church. While thinking, he said, “Oh, if only I knew if I would keep going until the end!” Suddenly, he heard God answer inside him: “If you knew, what would you do? Do now what you would do then, and you will be safe.” Feeling comforted, he accepted God’s will and stopped worrying. He stopped trying to guess the future and instead tried to find God’s perfect will in all good things he did.

“Trust in the Lord and do good,” says the Prophet; “live in the land and you will enjoy its blessings.” Many people don’t try hard to improve their lives because they are scared of how hard it will be. But those who bravely face tough challenges grow the most and become the best. A person makes the most progress and earns the most grace when they win the biggest fights against themselves and control their own desires. Everyone has their own challenges, but a hardworking person will get better than someone who is calm but doesn’t care about growing in goodness.

Two things help you get better: to stay away from bad habits you naturally struggle with, and to work hard for the good qualities you need most.

Also, try to avoid and fix the faults in others that annoy you. Use every chance to learn from good examples and copy them. But be careful not to do the bad things you don’t like in others. If you have done them before, try to fix yourself quickly. How you act affects how others see you.

It is so nice and sweet to see friends who are passionate, respectful, and well-behaved! But it is sad and painful to see them acting carelessly and not doing what they should! It hurts when they forget their purpose and focus on things that are not important to them.
