O Lord, because You were patient in Your life, especially in doing what the Father wanted, it makes sense that I, a very sinful person, should live patiently following Your will. As long as You want, I will carry the problems of this weak body for the good of my soul. Even though life now can feel really hard, Your grace makes it meaningful. Your example and the ways of the saints make life brighter and easier for those who are weak.

Life is also more comforting now than it was under the old law, when heaven seemed closed and the path to it was darker. Back then, very few people cared about reaching the eternal kingdom. The good people couldn’t enter heaven until Your suffering and holy death paid the price.

Oh, how much I thank You for showing me and all believers the right way to Your forever kingdom! Your life is our path, and through Your holy patience, we come closer to You, who are our reward. If You hadn’t gone first and taught us, who would want to follow? So many would have stayed far behind without Your holy example right in front of them. Even we who know about Your miracles and teachings are still not fully committed; what would happen if we didn’t have Your light to follow?

What are you saying, My child? Think about My suffering and the suffering of the saints, and stop complaining. You haven’t even had to suffer to the point of dying for your faith. What you’re going through is very little compared to what others faced — they were strongly tempted, troubled, and tormented in many ways. Remember how painful their troubles were, and you will find it easier to bear your own small problems. If your problems don’t seem small, maybe your impatience is making them seem worse. Whether your troubles are big or small, try to bear them patiently. The more you prepare yourself to suffer, the smarter you act and the bigger the reward you will get. You will suffer more easily if you train your mind and habits carefully.

Don’t say, "I can’t take this from that person, or I shouldn’t have to suffer this kind of thing because they hurt me a lot. They’ve accused me of many things I never did. But from someone else, I’d be okay to suffer as much as I think I should." That’s a foolish way to think because it doesn’t focus on patience or on God, who rewards patience. Instead, it judges the person and the offense. Someone who only suffers as much as they want, or only from people they like, is not truly patient. A truly patient person doesn’t think about who is causing the suffering — whether it’s a boss, a friend, or someone worse — or how many times it happens. No matter how bad or how often, they accept it gratefully as coming from God’s hand and see it as a great blessing.
