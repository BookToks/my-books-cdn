Chapter Fifty: How a lonely person should trust God

Dear Lord God, Holy Father, may You be blessed now and forever. Whatever You want will happen, and what You do is always good. Let me find joy in You — not in myself or anyone else, because You are the only true joy. You are my hope and my prize. You, Lord, are my happiness and my honor.

What do I have that You didn’t give me, without me earning it? Everything I have comes from You, everything You made is Yours.

I have been poor and struggling since I was young, and sometimes my soul is so sad it feels like crying. Sometimes I worry about the hard things coming my way. I really want the peace that Your children have, the peace You give when You comfort them. If You give me peace and holy joy, my soul will be full of songs and praise for You. But if You take Yourself away, like You often do, I won’t be able to follow Your commands. Instead, I will have to feel sorry for myself and pray, because today is different from yesterday and the day before, when Your light was shining on me and You protected me from temptations like under Your wings.

Just Father, always worthy of praise, the time has come for me to be tested.

Beloved Father, it is right that I should suffer a little for You now.

O Father, forever to be honored, the time You knew about forever is here — when for a short while I will be hurt on the outside, but inside, I will live with You always.

Let me be treated unfairly, let me be humbled, let me fail in front of people, let me suffer pains and troubles, so that I can rise again with You in the new light and be honored in heaven.

Holy Father, You have planned and wanted this. What happens is what You command. It is a kindness to Your friend to suffer and be troubled in this world for Your love, no matter how often or by whom it happens.

Nothing happens in the world without Your plan and reason. It is good for me, Lord, that You have made me humble, so I can learn how fair Your judgments are and stop being proud. It is good for me that shame covers my face so I look to You, not people, for comfort. I have also learned to fear Your mysterious judgment that comes to both good and bad people but is always fair and just.

Thank You for not sparing me from troubles but for hurting me with hard blows, causing me sadness and pain inside and out. No one under the sky can comfort me except You, my Lord God, the healer of souls, who can hurt and heal, who can bring down and lift up again.
