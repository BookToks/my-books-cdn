But it’s a problem when people focus too much on stuff that doesn’t really matter and don’t care enough about how they serve Me.

One day, Christ, the greatest teacher and Lord of angels, will come back to listen to everyone’s true thoughts. He will search everywhere, even the darkest places, and reveal what’s hidden. Then, no one will be able to argue or lie.

I am the one who can open a humble person’s mind in an instant, helping them understand more about eternal truth than years of school can teach. I teach quietly, without loud words or fights, without wanting fame or confusion.

I teach people to not care about material things or the present moment, but to seek what lasts forever. I want them to hunger for heaven, avoid pride, accept insults, trust only Me, want nothing without Me, and love Me above all else. One person who loved Me deeply learned amazing truths and said amazing things. They gained more by giving up everything than by studying tricky questions.

Sometimes I talk about simple things, other times about special secrets. For some, I show signs and stories gently, for others, I shine bright and reveal mysteries. Books have only one voice, but they don’t teach everyone the same because I am the true Teacher inside each person. I know their hearts, understand their thoughts, guide their actions, and give each person what they need.

The Forty-Fourth Chapter  
DON’T WORRY ABOUT OUTSIDE THINGS  
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
My child, it’s good for you to ignore many things and think of yourself as someone who is dead to the world, like it doesn’t affect you. It’s also smart to ignore things that bother you and focus on what brings you peace. It’s better to avoid arguments and let others have their own opinions. If you stay close to God and remember His judgment, it will be easier to handle losing in a fight.

THE DISCIPLE  
Where are we now, Lord? We get upset about temporary losses. We work hard and stress over small gains, but forget about saving our soul, which is the most important thing.

We pay attention to things that don’t really matter and ignore what is truly necessary—all because we focus too much on outside stuff. Unless we stop quickly, we will stay stuck in caring only about the surface.
