The Forty-Fifth Chapter  
NOT EVERYONE CAN BE TRUSTED BECAUSE IT’S EASY TO MESS UP WHEN TALKING  

Help me, Lord, because people can’t always be trusted. I’ve often thought someone was loyal, but I was wrong. And sometimes, I found loyalty where I didn’t expect it. So, hoping in people is a waste, but if I trust You, God, I will be saved. Thank You for everything that happens to us.  

We are weak and change our minds quickly. Who can be careful enough not to get tricked or confused sometimes? But if someone trusts You, Lord, and is honest in their heart, they won’t fall so easily. Even if problems come, You will help and comfort them fast. You never leave those who trust You till the end.  

It’s rare to find a friend who stays loyal through tough times. But You, Lord, are always completely faithful; no one else is like You.  

That holy person was very smart when they said, “My mind is steady because it’s built on Christ.” If I were like that, I wouldn’t get so worried or hurt by mean words. But how can anyone predict all problems and stop them? If the problems we expect hurt us, the ones we don’t expect can hurt even more. Why didn’t I protect myself better? Why did I trust people so easily? We are just weak humans, even though many think of us as angels.  

So, Lord, who should I trust? Only You. You are the truth and never lie or get tricked. People lie and make mistakes, especially when they talk. So, I shouldn’t believe everything that sounds true. You warned me to be careful of people, even those close to me, and not to believe everything I hear like “He’s here” or “He’s there.” I learned this the hard way, and I hope I’m more careful now, not more foolish. People say, “Be careful and keep this secret!” But while I stay quiet, they don’t—they tell others and betray me. Protect me, Lord, from people like that, so I don’t get hurt by their tricks. Help me speak only true and steady words, and keep me away from lying because I should avoid what I don’t want to suffer.  

Oh, how good and peaceful it is to stay quiet about others, not believe everything you hear, and not spread rumors too quickly.
