Many people don’t realize they look for themselves in what they do. They feel happy when things go their way, but if things don’t turn out how they want, they get upset and sad. Different opinions and feelings often cause fights between friends and even people who are religious.

Old habits are hard to change, and nobody wants to follow someone if they don’t understand where they’re going.

If you trust your brain or hard work more than you trust following Jesus, you won’t easily become truly wise. God wants us to fully trust Him and, through deep love, to go beyond just human knowledge.

The Fifteenth Chapter  
WORK DONE WITH LOVE  
Never do bad things, no matter what or who you love. But if someone really needs help, sometimes it’s okay to skip a good deed or change it to a better one. This isn’t skipping doing good, but making it better.

Without love, doing things outside doesn’t matter. But anything done with love, even if small, is important because God cares about the love behind it more than the action.

Someone who loves a lot does a lot. Someone who does something well also does a lot. And someone who works for everyone’s good, not just their own, does well.

Sometimes what looks like love is really just selfishness. People often act for their own wishes, rewards, or benefits. But someone with true love doesn’t think about themselves. They want everything to bring glory to God. They don’t feel jealous or want to feel proud; they only want God to be honored. They believe all good things come from God, and that’s where everyone will find peace in the end.

If people had even a little true love, they would see that everything on earth is pretty empty and meaningless!

The Sixteenth Chapter  
PUTTING UP WITH OTHERS’ MISTAKES  
Until God says otherwise, we should patiently accept things we can’t fix in ourselves or others. It’s better to think of these challenges as tests for your patience because without them, your good qualities don’t mean much.

Still, when things are hard, you should pray that God helps you stay calm and patient.
