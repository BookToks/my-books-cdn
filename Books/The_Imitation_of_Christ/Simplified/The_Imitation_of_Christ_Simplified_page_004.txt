We tried to put the text into English that people speak today instead of using old, confusing words found in many other translations of Christian classics. We think this makes the writing clearer and easier to understand for modern readers. Also, we used normal paragraphs instead of just short statements or verses like the original and some other versions. This helps make the reading smoother and shows how ideas connect better.

We’re not saying this version is better than the many English versions already out there, and we’re not trying to make the question of who wrote the book any more confusing.

Right now, most people believe that the Imitation was written by two or three men who were part of a group called the Brethren of the Common Life. This group was made up of priests in the Netherlands in the late 1300s. Scholars agree that Thomas Hemerken of Kempen, also known as Thomas À Kempis, later translated a collection of their writings—basically a spiritual diary—from Dutch into Latin. Thomas was born around 1380, learned from the Brethren, joined their community, and became a priest. He spent his life trying to live a perfect spiritual life and copying books for schools. These activities led to the creation of The Imitation of Christ. Although Thomas made some mistakes as an editor and translator, it’s thanks to him that The Imitation became, after the Bible, the most widely read book in the world. We are using his version here without cutting out any chapters or parts, even if some doubt who wrote them or if the style changes.

There is only one big change. The part about Holy Communion, which À Kempis called Book Three, is called Book Four here. This change makes the order easier to follow and matches what most editors think.
