Don’t be hard on people who are struggling with temptation. Instead, comfort them like you’d want to be comforted.

Temptation starts when your mind is unsure and you don’t trust God enough. Just like a ship without a rudder gets tossed around by waves, a person who isn’t careful can be tempted in many ways. Fire makes iron stronger, and temptations can make good people tougher. Sometimes we don’t know how strong we are until we face temptation.

It’s really important to watch out for temptation from the very start. It’s easier to fight it off if you don’t let it get into your mind in the first place.

Someone once said, “Fight temptation early; waiting too long lets it get stronger.” First, a thought pops into your head, then you imagine it more, then you start to enjoy it, and finally, you agree to it. If you don’t stop it early, temptation takes over. The longer you wait to fight it, the weaker you get, and the temptation gets stronger.

Some people face big temptations when they first start following God, others later on, and some deal with them all the time. Some only face small temptations. This happens because God knows what each person can handle and prepares everyone to be saved.

So don’t feel hopeless when you’re tempted. Pray to God even more, asking Him to help you. As Paul said, God will make sure the temptation isn’t too much for you to handle. Stay humble during hard times because God will save and lift up those who are humble.

Temptations and struggles show how much a person is growing. They also give chances to earn good things and become better.

It’s easy to be devoted when things are going well, but if you stay strong when things get tough, you have a chance to grow a lot.

Sometimes people avoid big temptations but fall to small ones often. This helps them stay humble and not get too confident about their strength.

Chapter 14: AVOID RASH JUDGMENT

Focus on yourself and don’t judge other people. When you judge others, you often waste effort, make mistakes, and can even do wrong. But judging yourself is always helpful.

We often think things are the way we want them to be because our feelings can trick us.

If we only wanted God, we wouldn’t get upset so easily when others disagree with us. But sometimes, inside us or around us, things pull us away from that.
