Please help me always want and choose what pleases You the most. Let Your wishes be mine. Let my wishes always follow Yours and match perfectly. Let my wishes be the same as Yours, both when wanting and not wanting, and let me not want anything except what You want or don’t want. Help me to let go of everything in this world, and for Your sake, be okay with being ignored or looked down on in this life. Give me, above all else, the desire to find rest in You, and let my heart be peaceful in You. You are the true peace of the heart. You alone are its rest.

Without You, everything is hard and confusing. In this peace, the same peace that is in You, the Most High, the forever Good, I will rest and sleep. Amen.

Chapter Sixteen: True comfort is only found in God. Whatever I want or imagine for my own comfort, I don’t look for here but in the future. Even if I had all the comforts and fun of the world, they wouldn’t last long. So, my soul, you can’t find complete happiness except in God, who helps the poor and humble. Wait a little longer, my soul, wait for God’s promise and you will get more good things in heaven than you can imagine. If you want things here too much, you will lose the forever things in heaven. Use temporary things, but want eternal things. You can’t be happy with temporary stuff because you weren’t made for that.

Even if you had everything in the world, you couldn’t be truly happy. Your real happiness is in God, who made everything—not the kind of happiness that people who love the world want, but the kind that good and faithful followers of Christ wait for, and that pure-hearted people who think about heaven sometimes get a small taste of.

All human comfort is weak and short. But the comfort that comes from the Truth inside you is real and blessed. A devoted person carries Jesus, their Comforter, everywhere and says to Him, “Be with me, Lord Jesus, always and everywhere.”

Let it be my comfort to be ready to give up all human comforts. And if I don’t feel Your comfort, let Your will and fair testing be my greatest comfort.

Because You won’t be angry forever or keep threatening forever.

Chapter Seventeen: Put all your worries in God’s hands. The voice of Christ says, “My child, let me do what I want with you.”
