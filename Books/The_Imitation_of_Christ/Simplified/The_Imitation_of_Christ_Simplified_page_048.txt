Give me more love, so I can feel deep inside how amazing it is to love and to be completely surrounded by love. Let me be carried away by love. Let me rise above myself with excitement and wonder. Let me sing about love, and let me follow You, my Love, to the highest places. Let my soul work hard praising You, happily loving You. Let me love You more than myself, and not love myself except because of You. Through You, let me love everyone who truly loves You, just like the rule of love that comes from You says.

Love is quick, honest, kind, nice, and fun. Love is strong, patient, loyal, careful, forgiving, and brave. Love never tries to get what’s best for itself because when someone only thinks about themselves, they lose love. Love is careful, humble, and honest.

Love is not weak or silly, and it doesn’t care about useless things. Love is serious and pure, steady and calm, careful with all feelings. Love listens to those in charge. Love thinks little of itself and is thankful to God; it always trusts and hopes in Him, even when things are hard, because you can’t really live in love without feeling some pain. Anyone who isn’t ready to face all problems and accept the will of the Beloved isn’t truly a lover. A lover must accept all hard and bitter things for the sake of the Beloved and should never turn away because of problems.

THE SIXTH CHAPTER: HOW TO KNOW IF YOU’RE A TRUE LOVER

THE VOICE OF CHRIST: My child, you are not yet a brave and wise lover.

THE DISCIPLE: Why, Lord?

THE VOICE OF CHRIST: Because you give up easily when things get a little tough and you want comfort too much.

A brave lover stays strong during hard times and ignores the tricks of the enemy. Just like I make him happy when things go well, I’m not upset with him when things go badly. A wise lover doesn’t care so much about the gifts from the One Who loves, but loves the One Who gives more. He cares more about the love of the Giver than the gifts and puts his Beloved above everything else. A true lover doesn’t focus on the gift but on Me, who am greater than any gift.

So it’s not all bad if sometimes you don’t feel as close to Me or My saints as you want. That good feeling you get sometimes is a sign of God’s grace and a little taste of Heaven. But don’t depend on it too much, because it comes and goes. Fighting against bad thoughts that attack you shows strength and is very good.
