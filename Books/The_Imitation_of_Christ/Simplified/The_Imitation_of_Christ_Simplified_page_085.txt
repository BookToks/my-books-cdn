Draw my attention to You and help me forget about all the things of this world. Please give me the strength to quickly get rid of all bad thoughts and to reject them. Help me, O heavenly Truth, so that nothing fake or empty can shake me.

Come, heavenly Sweetness, and make all dirtiness disappear from Your presence.

Forgive me too, and be kind to me whenever I think about anything other than You while I pray. I admit honestly that I often get distracted. Many times, my body is in one place, but my mind is somewhere else. Wherever my thoughts go, that’s where I am; and often my thoughts are with what I love. I quickly notice whatever naturally makes me happy or that I’m used to liking. That’s why You, who are the Truth, clearly said: "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." If I love heaven, I think about heavenly things gladly. If I love the world, I enjoy its good times and feel sad about its troubles. If I love my body, I often imagine things that are physical. If I love the spirit, I enjoy thinking about spiritual things. Whatever I love, I want to talk and listen about.

Happy is the person who, for Your sake, O Lord, ignores all other creatures, controls their natural desires, and fights against the desires of the body with a strong spirit, so that with a clear conscience they can offer You a pure prayer. By putting aside all earthly things inside and out, they become worthy to join the heavenly choirs.

The Forty-Ninth Chapter  
THE DESIRE FOR ETERNAL LIFE; THE GREAT REWARDS PROMISED TO THOSE WHO STRUGGLE  
THE VOICE OF CHRIST

My child, when you feel the wish for never-ending happiness coming to you from above, and when you want to leave your body to see My glory without any changes or dangers, open your heart wide and accept this holy feeling with all your eagerness. Give deep thanks to the heavenly Goodness that understands you so well, visits you so kindly, moves you so deeply, and holds you up so strongly so you don’t fall back into earthly things. You don’t get this from your own thoughts or efforts, but only by the kindness of heavenly grace and God’s attention. The reason for this is to help you grow in goodness and humility, to get ready for future challenges, to hold on to Me with all your heart, and to serve Me with a strong will.

My child, often when a fire burns, smoke also comes with the flame. In the same way, some people’s desires for heavenly things burn, but they still have temptations from physical desires. So, they don’t always act just to honor God when they pray so earnestly. Sometimes your own strong desire is like this too. When something is mixed with selfish reasons, it’s not pure or perfect.
