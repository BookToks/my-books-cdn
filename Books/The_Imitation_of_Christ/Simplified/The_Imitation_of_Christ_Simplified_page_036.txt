Finding Jesus is like finding a super rare treasure, something better than anything else. But if you lose Him, you lose more than the whole world. A person who lives without Jesus is the poorest person ever, while someone who lives with His love is the richest.

It’s important to know how to talk with Jesus and how to keep Him close. Be humble and calm, and Jesus will stay with you. Be devoted and peaceful, and He won’t leave you. But if you turn away and focus on the outside world, you might push Him away and lose His grace. And if you lose Jesus, who else can you turn to? You need a true friend to live well, and if Jesus isn’t that friend, you’ll feel very sad and alone.

So, don’t be foolish by trusting or being happy about anything else more than Jesus. It’s better to go against the whole world than to upset Jesus. Of everyone you care about, let Him be your special love. Love everything because of Jesus, but love Jesus for who He is.

Jesus Christ should be loved with a special kind of love because He alone is good and faithful. Love your friends and even your enemies because of Him, and pray that everyone gets to know and love Him.

Don’t want special praise or love for yourself because that belongs only to God, who has no equal. Don’t wish for people to focus their love on you, and don’t get caught up in loving anyone too much. Let Jesus live in you and in every good person. Stay pure and free inside, not tied down by anyone else.

If you want to feel how sweet the Lord is, come to God with a clean and open heart. You won’t find true happiness unless God’s grace prepares you and helps you give up everything to be close to Him alone.

When God’s grace is with you, you can do anything. But when it leaves, you feel weak and abandoned. Still, don’t get sad or give up. Instead, wait calmly for God’s plan and accept whatever happens, praising Jesus. After winter comes summer, after night comes day, and after storms comes calm.

Chapter Nine: NOT WANTING ANY COMFORT

It’s not hard to give up human comfort when you have God’s comfort. But it’s really amazing to live without either human or divine comfort, to accept being lonely in your heart for God’s honor, not looking for anything for yourself, and not thinking about your own worth.

Does it matter if you’re happy and devoted when God’s grace comes? Everyone wants that moment because when God helps you, life feels easier.

It’s no surprise if you don’t feel weighed down when God, the Almighty, carries you and guides you. We all like to have something to comfort us, and it’s hard to stop caring about ourselves.

The holy martyr Lawrence and his priest beat the world because they didn’t care about anything that seemed nice to them, and because they loved Christ, they patiently let go of the great priest Sixtus, whom they loved very much.
