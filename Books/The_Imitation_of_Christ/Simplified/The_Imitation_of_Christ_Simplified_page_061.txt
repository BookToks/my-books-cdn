How can someone love a life that has so much pain and suffering? How can it even be called life when it brings so many deaths and problems? Yet, people still love life and try to find happiness in it.

Many people say the world is fake and empty, but they don’t leave it easily because their wants are very strong. Some things make them love the world, while others make them hate it. Wanting things, being proud, and craving fun make them love the world. But the pain and troubles that come from those things make them tired and dislike the world.

People who only care about pleasure lose their true selves in the world. They think there is happiness hidden under the hard parts because they have never felt the joy of God or the happiness that comes from doing what is right. But those who reject the world and live for God with discipline know about the deep joy God promises. They see clearly how wrong and misleading the world is.

The Twenty-first Chapter ABOVE ALL GOODS AND ALL GIFTS WE MUST REST IN GOD THE DISCIPLE

Above everything, my soul, always rest in God. He is the true and forever peace of those who love Him.

Dear Jesus, please help me to find my rest in You more than in anything else—more than health, beauty, honor, power, knowledge, riches, joy, fame, comfort, hopes, gifts, or anything else. Help me to rest in You more than angels, everything I can see or imagine, and anything that isn’t You, my God.

You, Lord, are the best of all. You are the highest and the strongest. You are enough and bring the most comfort. You are the most beautiful, loving, noble, and glorious. You have every perfect thing that has ever existed or will exist. So, anything You give me besides Yourself is not enough. My heart cannot be fully happy until it rests in You alone, above all gifts and created things.

Who, Jesus, my beloved and pure Lover, Lord of all, will give me the freedom to fly to You and rest there? When will I be free enough to see how sweet You are, my God? When will I be able to focus completely on You so much that, because of Your love, I feel only You above everything, in a way no one else knows?
