The children of Israel once told Moses, "You speak to us, and we will listen; don’t let the Lord speak to us, or we might die." But I don’t want that. Instead, like the prophet Samuel, I ask humbly and seriously, "Speak, Lord, because Your servant is listening." Don’t let Moses or any other prophets speak to me; only You, Lord God, who inspired all the prophets, should speak. You alone can teach me perfectly. Without You, they can do nothing. 

They say good things, but they can’t give the spirit. They speak beautifully, but if You stay silent, they can’t light a fire in my heart. They bring the message; You show the meaning. They share mysteries; You explain them. They give commands; You help us follow them. They show the way; You give the strength to travel it. They work on the outside; You teach and brighten our hearts. They water the plants outside; You make them grow.

They shout words; You help us understand.

So don’t let Moses speak to me, but You, Lord my God, speak, or I will die inside and be useless if I only get advice but no fire in my heart. If I hear words but don’t keep them, know them but don’t love them, believe but don’t obey, then those words will judge me.

Speak, Lord, because I am listening. "You have the words of eternal life." Speak to comfort my soul and change my life, for Your praise, glory, and honor forever.

The Third Chapter: LISTEN HUMBLY TO GOD’S WORD.

Many don’t listen to Christ’s voice. My child, hear My words. They are sweeter than anything wise people say. My words give life and spirit. Don’t judge them with your own mind. Don’t say them just to sound good but listen quietly, humbly, and with love.

The Disciple: "Happy is the person You correct, Lord, and teach from Your law, giving peace during hard times," and so they are not alone on earth.
