Chapter Four: We Must Walk Before God Humbly and Honestly

The Voice of Christ  
My child, always be honest and simple in your heart when you walk with Me. If you do, I will protect you from evil attacks. The truth will set you free from lies and from those who want to hurt you. If the truth frees you, you will be truly free and won’t care about what people say that doesn’t matter.

The Disciple  
Lord, that is true. Please let this be true for me. Teach me Your truth. Protect me and keep me safe until the end. Let Your truth free me from bad feelings and wrong loves, so I can walk with You with a free heart.

The Voice of Christ  
I will teach you what is right and what pleases Me. Think about your sins with sadness and don’t think you are better than others because of good things you do. You are a sinner. You have many weaknesses and get caught up in them. By yourself, you don’t do much good. You fall easily, get upset easily, and fail easily. You have nothing to be proud of, but many reasons to feel humble because you are weaker than you realize.

So, don’t think your actions are great. Don’t care about things that are not important or lasting. Care most about what lasts forever. Let the truth that never ends make you happy, and let your mistakes make you sad. Don’t be afraid or hate anything except your own bad habits and sins; those should bother you more than losing things.

Some people walk with Me without being honest. Because of pride and curiosity, they want to know My secrets and understand God’s mysteries but ignore their own souls and saving themselves. Because of their pride and curiosity, and because I am against that attitude, they often fall into big troubles and sins.

Be afraid of God’s judgment! Respect the power of the Almighty! Don’t talk about God’s work without thinking about your own sins — what serious things you have done wrong and how many good things you have ignored.

Some people show their faith only through books, pictures, or outward signs. Some say My name but have little of Me in their hearts. But others, who understand and love Me deeply, always want eternal things; they don’t want to think about worldly stuff and only take care of their basic needs because they have to.
