Stars have fallen from heaven, and I — just dust — how can I be so confident? People who seemed worthy of praise have fallen deep, and I have seen those who once enjoyed great things now settling for less.

There is no holiness if You, Lord, stop helping. No wisdom if You stop guiding, no courage if You stop protecting. No purity is safe without Your watch. Our efforts mean nothing if You don’t keep an eye on us. Left on our own, we fail and fall, but with You, we rise and live. We are weak, but You make us strong. We lose passion, but You light a fire in us. So, I should see myself as humble and small! I shouldn’t think too highly of anything good in me! I should accept Your deep judgments, Lord, because I am nothing without You!

Oh, how heavy and deep it is! I feel like nothing at all! Where is glory then? How can I trust my own goodness? All pride disappears under Your judgments on me.

What is all flesh to You? Should clay be proud of the one who made it?

How can someone who truly follows God be full of pride? The whole world can’t make a person proud who lives by the truth. And someone who trusts God won’t be moved by flattering words. Even those who speak are nothing; their words fade away, but God’s truth lasts forever.

The Fifteenth Chapter: HOW ONE SHOULD FEEL AND SPEAK ABOUT EVERYTHING DESIRABLE

THE VOICE OF CHRIST

My child, this is how you should speak every time: "Lord, if this pleases You, then let it be. If it honors You, Lord, let it happen in Your name. If You think it will help me and bring good, then let me use it for Your honor. But if You know it will harm me or not help my soul, then take this desire away."

Not every wish comes from the Holy Spirit, even if it seems good.

It’s hard to know if a feeling is from a good or bad spirit, or even from yourself. Many who seemed led by good spirits were fooled in the end.

Whatever your mind thinks is good, ask and want it with fear of God and a humble heart. Above all, give everything to Me with true surrender, and say: "Lord, You know what is best for me; do what You want. Give what You will, when You will. Do with me what You know is best, what pleases You most, and honors You most. Put me where You want and treat me freely in all things. I am in Your hands; turn me whichever way You want.

Look, I am Your servant, ready to obey in all things. I don’t want to live for myself but for You — I wish I could do this perfectly and worthily!"

A PRAYER THAT GOD’S WILL BE DONE

Give me Your grace, most merciful Jesus, to be with me, work in me, and stay with me until the very end.
