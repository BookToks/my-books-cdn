Chapter Six  
THE JOY OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE  

A good person feels proud because their conscience is clear. Keep your conscience clean, and you will feel happy, even when life is hard. A good conscience can handle tough times and still bring joy. But a guilty conscience is always restless and scared.  

You will sleep well if your heart has no regrets.  

Don’t be happy unless you’ve done something good. People who do bad things never feel true peace or happiness. The Bible says, “There is no peace for the wicked.” Even if they say, “We’re safe and nothing bad will happen to us,” don’t believe them. God’s anger will come quickly, and their plans will fail.  

It’s not hard for someone who loves God to be proud during hard times because they see it as sharing in Jesus’ suffering. But praise from people doesn’t last long, and the world’s success often comes with sadness. The real pride of good people comes from their conscience, not from what others say. Their happiness comes from God and is based on truth.  

Someone who wants true, lasting glory doesn’t care about temporary fame. If a person really wants to be famous on earth, they probably don’t care much about being honored in heaven.  

A person who doesn’t worry about being praised or blamed has great peace. If their conscience is clear, they are easy to please and feel calm.  

Praise won’t make you holier, and blame won’t make you less holy. You are who you are, and in God’s eyes, you can’t be better or worse than your true self. If you think about who you are inside, you won’t care what others say. People judge by appearances, but God looks at your heart. People look at what you do, but God cares about why you do it.  

A humble person always tries to do good and doesn’t think much of themselves. It shows strong faith and purity when someone doesn’t need comfort from things around them. A person who doesn’t need praise from others trusts God completely. St. Paul says, “It’s not the one who praises himself who is accepted, but the one whom God praises.” Walking with God inside, without depending on outside things, is what it means to be truly inward.
