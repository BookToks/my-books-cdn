But you still have many things you need to give up, and unless you completely give them to Me, you won’t get what you’re asking for.

I advise you to buy from Me gold that has been tested by fire, so you can become truly rich—rich in heavenly wisdom that looks down on things that are low. Forget about worldly wisdom and being proud of yourself.

I said: trade what people think is valuable for what seems worthless. True heavenly wisdom means not thinking you’re better than others and not trying to be famous on earth. It looks small and unimportant and is almost forgotten because many people say they want it but don’t live by it. Yet this heavenly wisdom is like a very precious pearl, hidden from most people.

MY CHILD, don’t trust how you feel right now, because your feelings will change. While you live, your feelings will keep changing even if you don’t want them to.

Sometimes you will feel happy, other times sad; sometimes calm, other times upset; sometimes devoted, other times not; sometimes hardworking, other times lazy; sometimes serious, other times silly.

But a wise person who has learned well can rise above these changes. They don’t pay attention to their feelings or where their moods come from, as long as their whole mind is focused on their true goal. This way, they can stay steady, strong, and unshaken, keeping their focus on Me, no matter what changes happen around them. The clearer and more focused their goal is, the better they can handle life’s storms.

But often, pure focus gets blurry because it gets distracted by anything that looks fun or nice. It’s very rare to find someone who doesn’t want something for themselves. For example, the people who came to Bethany to see Martha and Mary didn’t come just for Jesus, but also to see Lazarus.

So, your focus must be cleaned and made pure, aimed only at Me, no matter what else tries to grab your attention.
