Your powerful hand can take this temptation away from me or make it less strong so I don’t completely fall under it, just like You, my God and my Mercy, have done many times before. The harder my situation is, the easier it is for You to help, because You are the Most High.

The Thirtieth Chapter  
THE SEARCH FOR GOD’S HELP AND TRUST TO GET GRACE BACK  
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  

My child, I am the Lord who gives you strength when things get tough. Come to Me when you don’t feel okay. The reason you don’t feel comforted is because you don’t pray soon enough. Before you pray honestly to Me, you look for comfort in other things and enjoy outside pleasures. Nothing really helps you until you understand that I am the one who saves those who trust Me. Without Me, there is no real help, good advice, or lasting fix.

Now, after the storm, be brave and get strong again by remembering My kindness. I am close, says the Lord, ready to make everything better not just fully, but more than you expect. Is anything too hard for Me? Will I promise and then not do it? Where is your faith? Stay strong and keep going. Be patient and brave, and comfort will come to you at the right time. Wait for Me; wait — and I will come to heal you.

It’s only a temptation that bothers you, a silly fear that scares you.

What good is worrying about the future? Does it give you anything but more problems? Each day has enough trouble of its own. It’s silly and useless to be sad or happy about future things that might never happen. But it’s normal for people to be tricked by these thoughts, and it shows a weak soul to be controlled by the enemy’s ideas. He doesn’t care if he wins by making you love the present or fear the future.

So don’t let your heart be upset or scared. Believe in Me and trust My mercy. When you feel far from Me, I am often very close.

When you think you have lost almost everything, you might actually be close to gaining great good.

Not everything is lost when things don’t go your way. Don’t judge by how you feel now, don’t give up when trouble comes, and don’t think all hope is gone. And don’t feel alone if I let you go through hard times or take away the comfort you want. This is the way to heaven, and it’s better for you and My other followers to face challenges than to have everything go as you want. I know your secret thoughts, and I know it helps you to be sad sometimes so you don’t get proud from success and think you are more than you really are.
