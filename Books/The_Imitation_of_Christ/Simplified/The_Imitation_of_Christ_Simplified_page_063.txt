If one person gets more and another gets less, remember that everything belongs to You, and without You, no one can receive anything. The person who gets more should not brag or think they are better than others, or act rude to those who get less. The one who is humble and thankful, even if they have less, is actually greater and better. The person who thinks they are the lowest and least worthy is the one who is ready to receive the biggest blessing.

If someone has fewer gifts, they should not feel sad, impatient, or jealous of the richer person. Instead, they should thank You with all their heart because You give freely and kindly to everyone. Everything comes from You, so You deserve praise in all things. You know what is best for each person, and it’s not for us to judge why one gets less and another more, but for You, who know everyone’s worth.

So, Lord God, I see it as a great blessing not to have many things that people think are great and wonderful. Someone who knows they are poor and weak should not be sad. Instead, they should feel happy and comforted because You chose the poor, humble, and ignored people in this world to be Your friends and helpers. Your Apostles prove this true—they were leaders in the world, but they lived simply and humbly. They didn’t complain and were happy even when people looked down on them or treated them badly because they loved You.

A person who loves You and sees all the good things You give should be happiest when doing what You want. They should be so content that they want to be the least, while others want to be the greatest. They should feel just as peaceful being last as being first, and be okay with being ignored or forgotten as much as with being honored and famous. They should want Your will and Your honor more than anything else, and this should comfort them more than all the gifts they have or will get.

The Twenty-Third Chapter  
FOUR THINGS WHICH BRING GREAT PEACE  
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  

My child, I will now teach you how to find peace and true freedom.

Try to do what others want instead of only what you want.  

Always choose to have less rather than more.  

Always try to be last and put yourself below everyone else.  

Always want and pray that God’s will is done completely in you.  

If you do these things, you will find peace and rest.
