Let Your presence fully fill me, burn in me, and change me into Yourself, so I can be one spirit with You through the gift of close union and the strong power of Your deep love.

Don’t let me leave You feeling empty and thirsty, but be kind to me like You have been to Your saints many times before.

It’s no surprise if I become completely filled with You and give up myself, because You are a fire that never goes out, a love that cleans the heart and opens the mind.

THE SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER  
THE BURNING LOVE AND STRONG DESIRE TO RECEIVE CHRIST  

With all my heart and love, I want to receive You, Lord, just like many saints and holy people who pleased You by their pure lives and deep devotion during Holy Communion.

O my God, eternal love, my greatest good, my endless happiness, I want to receive You with as much desire and respect as any saint ever did. Even though I’m not worthy to feel all that devotion, I still give You all my heart as if I had all those strong and loving feelings.

Whatever a faithful mind can think or wish for, I give it all to You with the deepest respect and true love. I want to keep nothing for myself but to freely offer You everything I have.

O Lord God, my Creator and Redeemer, today I want to receive You with the same respect, praise, honor, thankfulness, worthiness, love, faith, hope, and purity that Your holy Mother, the Virgin Mary, had when she humbly said yes to the angel who told her about Your coming: “Behold the servant of the Lord; let it be done to me as you said.”  

Just like Your blessed messenger, John the Baptist, who was filled with joy and the Holy Spirit even before he was born, and later, seeing Jesus, humbly said with love, “The friend of the bridegroom who listens and shares his joy is truly happy,” I want to be filled with strong holy desires and give myself to You with all my heart.

So I offer You the happiness of all loving hearts, their deep feelings, their joyful thoughts, their spiritual light, and heavenly visions, along with all the good things and praises that have been or will be celebrated.
