Your discipline is on me, and Your rod will teach me.

Look, dear Father, I am in Your hands. I accept Your correction. Hit my back and my neck, so I can change my stubborn ways to follow Your will. Make me a humble and faithful follower, like You kindly do, so I can follow Your every command. I give myself and everything I have to You to be corrected, because it’s better to be punished now than later.

You know everything, nothing is hidden from You. You know what will happen before it does, and no one needs to tell You what’s going on in the world. You know what will help me grow and how much trouble I need to get rid of my bad habits. Do what You want with me and don’t look down on my sinful life, which only You truly understand.

Please, Lord, help me to know what I need to know, to praise what pleases You most, to value what You think is precious, and to hate what You see as unclean.

Don’t let me judge by just what I see or listen to what ignorant people say. Help me to see clearly between what is real and spiritual, and always try to please You above all. People often make mistakes in their judgments, and those who love only what they can see are wrong too. How does it help a person to be thought better by others? The liar fools the liar, the proud fool the proud, the blind fool the blind, and the weak fool the weak by praising each other, but their empty praise only makes them look worse. As humble St. Francis said, people are only what You see them as, nothing more.

The Fifty-First Chapter  
WHEN WE CAN’T REACH THE HIGHEST, WE MUST DO HUMBLE WORKS  
THE VOICE OF CHRIST  

My child, you can’t always keep up a strong desire to be good or stay in deep prayer. Because of human sin, sometimes you have to deal with lower things and the hard parts of life, even if you don’t want to. As long as you live in this mortal body, you will feel tired and heavy in your heart. So, you should feel sad about the burden of your body that stops you from always praying and thinking about God.

When you feel this way, it’s good to focus on simple, humble tasks and refresh yourself by doing good deeds. Wait patiently and confidently for My heavenly help. Bear your hard times and dry feelings until I visit you again and take away your worries. I will help you forget your troubles and bring you peace inside. I will open the Scriptures before you so you can start moving forward in following My commands with an open heart.
