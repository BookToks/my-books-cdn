Every day, we should remind ourselves of our goals and get excited about them like it’s the first day we started something important. We should say, "Help me, God, to stick to my good choices and serve You well. Please help me start fresh today, because so far I haven’t done well." How we think and want things will decide how we improve. If someone strong-willed messes up a lot, what about someone who only tries a little or gives up quickly? There are many ways we can fail to keep our promises to ourselves, and even small mistakes can cause problems.

Good people rely on God’s help instead of just their own smarts to keep their promises. They trust God in everything because people can plan, but God decides what really happens, and His plans aren’t always like ours. Sometimes, if we miss a habit because of good reasons or to help someone else, it’s okay and we can start again later. But if we give up just because we’re tired or lazy, that’s a big problem and can hurt us. Even though we try hard, we often mess up. Still, we need to have clear goals, especially about the things we struggle with most. We should watch and take care of both our outer actions and our inner thoughts because both matter for becoming our best selves.

If you can’t stay focused all the time, at least do it once a day, in the morning or at night. In the morning, make a promise to yourself, and in the evening, think about what you said, did, and thought during the day. You might find times you hurt God or others without meaning to.

Get ready to fight against bad temptations like a strong person. Control your desires, and it will be easier to control other urges. Don’t just sit around doing nothing; read, write, pray, think, or do something helpful for others. But don’t be too hard on your body without thinking, because not everyone should do the same kind of discipline.

Special prayers or habits that not everyone does should be done privately, not shown off in front of others. Also, don’t skip community prayers just because you like your own personal prayers more. But if you finish all the required prayers and have free time, then you can spend it doing your own personal things.

Not everyone has the same way of praying or the same habits. Different people like different things, and different times need different prayers. We need certain prayers when we’re tempted, others when we’re resting and peaceful. Some prayers help when we’re sad, and others when we’re happy because of God.

Around important celebrations, we should refresh our prayers and ask the saints for help more earnestly. Between these celebrations, we should live as if we might leave this world soon and go to a perfect, eternal celebration.

During holy times, we should get ready carefully, live better lives, and follow the rules more strictly, as if we were about to get a special reward from God. If this reward doesn’t come right away, we should understand that we aren’t ready yet and not worthy of the great glory that will come in time.
