Lots of people say a lot of things, so you can’t always trust what they say.

You can’t make everyone happy. Paul tried to please everyone in God’s name and did his best to help and save others. But even then, some people judged him or looked down on him. So, he trusted God, who knows everything, and stayed patient and humble when people said mean or wrong things about him. Sometimes he did respond, but only so weaker people wouldn’t get confused.

So, who are you to be scared of other people? They’re here today and gone tomorrow. If you respect God, you won’t be afraid of what people do. What can they really do to you? They hurt themselves more than you, and no matter who they are, God will judge them. Keep thinking about God and don’t get into fights over silly words.

If it feels like you’re losing or being unfairly embarrassed, don’t feel sorry for yourself or get angry. Look to heaven and to Me, who can save you from shame and give everyone what they deserve.

MY CHILD, give up yourself and you will find Me. Let go of your own plans and things, and you will always gain something better. When you truly give yourself up, you will get more grace.

How often should I give myself up, Lord? What exactly should I give up?

---

Always, every hour, in big things and small things — nothing is left out. I want you to let go of yourself completely. How else can you be mine or I be yours unless you give up your own will inside and outside? The sooner you do this, the better for you. The more honestly you do it, the more you’ll please Me and the more good things you’ll get.

Some people give up themselves but keep some control because they don’t fully trust God, so they still try to take care of themselves. Others give everything at first but then give up when things get tough and go back to old ways, so they don’t really get better. These people won’t find true freedom or a close friendship with Me unless they completely give themselves up every day.
