Never having any problems or pain in your heart or body doesn’t happen in this life but only in eternal rest. So, don’t think you have true peace just because you don’t feel sad or face any problems. Don’t believe everything is perfect if things always go your way. And don’t think you’re great or especially loved just because you feel very devoted and happy. A true lover of goodness isn’t judged by these things, and becoming better doesn’t depend on them.

THE DISCIPLE: What does it depend on, Lord?

THE VOICE OF CHRIST: It depends on giving yourself fully to God's will, not trying to get what you want in small or big things, whether about this life or the next. This way, you will stay calm and thankful whether things go well or badly, seeing everything clearly.

If you become brave and patient with hope, ready to suffer even when you don’t feel any inner comfort, and don’t blame yourself or think you shouldn’t suffer, but accept that I am fair in all I do and praise My holy name — then you will follow the true path to peace. Then you can hope to see Me again happily. If you completely stop thinking only of yourself, you will have a lot of peace, as much as is possible in this life.

The Twenty-Sixth Chapter  
THE IMPORTANCE OF A FREE MIND, GAINED THROUGH PRAYER, NOT JUST STUDY

THE DISCIPLE: Lord, a perfect person never stops focusing on spiritual things and can go through many problems as if they don’t have any. Not like a lazy person, but someone who, because of a free mind, doesn’t have unhealthy love for anything created.

Keep me, merciful God, from the worries of life, so I don’t get too caught up in them. Keep me from too many wants of the body, so I’m not trapped by pleasure. Keep me from all mental darkness, so I’m not broken by troubles or defeated. I don’t ask to be free from things that people usually want, but from the troubles that hurt the soul and stop me from feeling free in spirit as often as I want.
