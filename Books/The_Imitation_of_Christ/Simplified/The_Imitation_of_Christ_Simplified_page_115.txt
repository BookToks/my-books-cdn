When I see how some people come to Your Sacrament full of love and devotion, I often feel ashamed and confused. I come to Your altar and the Holy Communion feeling cold and distant. My heart feels dry and empty. I am not on fire with love for You, God, like many others who want Communion so much that they can’t stop crying and deeply long to be close to You, the source of life.

These people can only satisfy their hunger by joyfully receiving Your Body with eagerness. Their strong faith shows they truly believe You are really there. When Jesus lives in their hearts, they truly understand Him during Communion.

But this kind of love and devotion is often too much for me.

Please be kind to me, sweet Jesus. Help me, Your poor servant, to feel at least a little bit of Your loving kindness during Communion. Let my faith grow stronger, my hope in Your goodness increase, and my love for You burn brightly, fed by the heavenly food You give.

Your mercy can give me the grace I want and fill my soul with passion whenever You choose. Even though I don’t have the strong desire that others have now, I pray and hope to have that same burning love. I want to be counted among those who love You deeply.

You must really want to receive the grace of devotion. Ask for it with all your heart, wait for it patiently and hopefully, accept it gratefully, protect it humbly, work with it carefully, and trust God to decide when and how to give it.

When you don’t feel much devotion inside, be humble but don’t get too sad or upset. Sometimes God gives what you’ve been praying for in just one moment. Sometimes He waits until the end to give what He didn’t give at first. If grace came right away every time, people might not appreciate it. So wait patiently and hopefully for the grace of devotion.
