With God, nothing you suffer for Him, no matter how small, goes unrewarded. Be ready to fight if you want to win. You can’t get the prize of patience without struggle, and if you refuse to suffer, you refuse the prize. But if you want to be rewarded, fight bravely and be patient. Without hard work, there is no rest, and without fighting, no victory.

  
O Lord, please make what seems impossible for me possible through Your help. You know I can’t handle much suffering and I get discouraged quickly when things go wrong. Let the pain I go through for Your name be something I accept gladly, because suffering for You helps my soul.

  
I will admit my mistakes to myself and confess my weakness to You, Lord.  

  
It’s often small things that make me sad and down. I want to be brave, but even a little temptation can really trouble me.  

  
Sometimes tiny things cause big problems. When I feel safe and don’t expect it, even a small challenge almost overwhelms me. So, Lord, look at how weak and low I am, as You know so well. Have mercy on me and pull me out of this mess so I won’t stay stuck and hopeless forever.  

  
I’m often upset that I’m so likely to fail and so weak against my own desires. Even though I don’t want to give in, the struggle is hard and tires me out. It’s exhausting to live with constant battles. Because bad thoughts come to me so easily and leave so slowly, I see clearly how weak I am.  

  
Oh mighty God of Israel, who loves faithful souls, please notice my hard work and sadness and help me with everything I try to do!  

  
Give me strength and courage from heaven so my weak body, which I have to fight as long as I live, doesn’t control me.  

  
Oh no! What kind of life is this, always full of problems and pain, with traps and enemies everywhere? When one trouble ends, another one starts. Sometimes, while I’m still fighting one problem, many more come without warning.
