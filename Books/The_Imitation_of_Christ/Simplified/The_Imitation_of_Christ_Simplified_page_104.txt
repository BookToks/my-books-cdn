If I’m often careless and lazy when I celebrate or pray, what would happen if I didn’t get this help and support? Even though I’m not always ready or in the right mood to celebrate every day, I will still try my best at the right times to receive the holy Mysteries and share in this amazing gift. This is really the main comfort for a faithful person who is separated from You by death—that they often think of God and receive their Beloved with deep respect.

Oh, it’s amazing how much You love us! You, the Lord God, who made everything and gives life to all, choose to come to a poor soul and satisfy her hunger with all Your divine and human love! How lucky and blessed is the person who gets to receive You, her Lord God, and feels full of spiritual happiness! What an amazing Master she welcomes, what a special guest she receives, what a sweet friend she finds, what a true companion she gains, and how beautiful and noble is the partner she embraces—loved and wanted more than anything else! Let heaven, earth, and all their treasures be quiet before You, most sweet Beloved, because all their glory and beauty come from Your kindness, and they can’t compare to the beauty of Your name, whose wisdom is beyond words.

The Fourth Chapter MANY BLESSINGS ARE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE COMMUNION WORTHILY THE DISCIPLE O LORD my God, please bless me with Your kindness so I can approach Your amazing Sacrament in a worthy and respectful way. Lift my heart to You and take away my heavy laziness. Come to me with Your saving grace so I can feel Your sweetness hidden in this Sacrament like water deep in a spring. Open my eyes to see this great Mystery and give me the strength to believe in it with strong faith.

Because this is Your work, not something humans made, Your holy rule, not a human idea. No one can fully understand these things, not even angels with their sharp sight. So how could I, a sinner who is just dust and ashes, understand such a great mystery?

O Lord, I come to You because You asked me to, with a simple heart, strong faith, hope, and respect. I truly believe that You are here in this Sacrament, God and man. You want me to receive You and be one with You in love. So I ask for Your mercy and a special gift that I may be completely joined with You and filled with Your love, not needing to look for outside comfort. This highest and most important Sacrament is the healing of soul and body, the cure for every spiritual weakness. In it, my faults are fixed, my desires controlled, and my temptations lessened or stopped. In it, more grace is given, growing virtue is fed, faith is made stronger, hope is lifted, and love is turned into a flame.
