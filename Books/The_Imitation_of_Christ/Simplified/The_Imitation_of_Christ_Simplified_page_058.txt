I know what’s best for you. You think like a person, but your feelings are often influenced by love and care.

THE DISCIPLE  
Lord, what You say is true. You care for me more than I can care for myself. Anyone who doesn’t trust You is in danger. If I can keep my faith strong, Lord, please do whatever You want with me.

Because whatever You do will be good.

If You want me to go through hard times, I will still thank You. If You want me to be happy, I will thank You too. If You comfort me, I will thank You, and if You let me suffer, I will thank You forever.

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
My child, this is the attitude you need if you want to follow Me. You should be ready to suffer just as much as to enjoy good times. You should accept being poor or rich, happy or sad, without complaint.

THE DISCIPLE  
Lord, I will accept any suffering You send me. I’m ready to take both good and bad things from You—the sweet and the bitter, sadness and joy—and I will be thankful for all of it. Keep me from sin, and I won’t be afraid of death or hell. Don’t reject me or erase me from the Book of Life, and no matter what troubles come, they won’t hurt me.

The Eighteenth Chapter  
TEMPORAL SUFFERINGS SHOULD BE BORNE PATIENTLY, AFTER THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST  

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
My child, I came down from heaven to save you and took on your pain—not because I had to, but because I love you. I want you to learn how to be patient and handle life’s hardships without complaining. From the time I was born until I died on the cross, I faced suffering. I didn’t have many material things. People often complained about Me. I was insulted and treated badly, but I stayed patient. Even though I did good, people were ungrateful. They spoke badly of My miracles and laughed at My teaching.
