It is God’s choice to give grace and comfort whenever He wants, as much as He wants, and to whoever He wants, and no one can change that.

Some careless people have ruined themselves by trying to do more than they could. They ignored their own weaknesses and followed their feelings instead of thinking carefully. Because they wanted to do things beyond what God wanted, they quickly lost His grace. Those who had hoped to be close to God became lost and humbled so they could learn not to rely on themselves but to trust in Him.

People who are new and inexperienced in following God can easily make mistakes unless they listen to wise advice. But if they want to do things their own way and don’t trust those with more experience, they could get into trouble, especially if they refuse to change their prideful ways. People who think they know everything usually don’t accept help well. It’s better to have a little knowledge and be humble than to have a lot and be proud. It’s better to have less if it keeps you humble.

Someone who only wants to enjoy life is acting foolishly because they forget how weak they once were and how much they need to respect God’s power. And someone who gets too sad or scared when things go wrong isn’t being brave or wise either. People who feel too safe during good times often become too scared during hard times.

If you were wise enough to always stay humble and control yourself, you wouldn’t fall into trouble so easily.

When you feel very excited and full of faith, think about how you will feel when that excitement fades. When that happens, remember that God may take away this feeling for a while to teach you a lesson and show His power. These hard times can actually help you more than if everything was always easy.

A person’s worth is not shown by having many visions, feelings, or knowledge, or by being better than others. It is shown by truly being humble, loving God with all your heart, always trying to honor Him, not caring about yourself, and even being okay with being looked down on rather than praised.

Chapter Eight: HUMBLING YOURSELF BEFORE GOD

I will talk to my Lord, even though I am just dust and ashes. If I think I am better than this, God will be against me, and my sins will prove I’m wrong. But if I truly humble myself and see that I am nothing, if I let go of all pride and see myself as just dust, then God’s grace will help me, His light will fill my heart, and all pride will disappear forever.
