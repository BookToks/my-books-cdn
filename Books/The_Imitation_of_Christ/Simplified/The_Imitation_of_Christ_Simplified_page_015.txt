Chapter 12: Why Hard Times Are Important

It’s good for us to go through hard times sometimes because they remind us that life is a test and we shouldn’t rely only on things in the world. It’s also good to face challenges, like when people don’t believe us or judge us unfairly even if we’re doing the right thing. These experiences help us stay humble and stop us from becoming proud. When people don’t give us credit or think badly of us, we are more likely to turn to God, who knows what’s really in our hearts. So, a person should trust God so much that they don’t need others to make them feel better.

When a good person is going through pain or bad thoughts, they see clearly that they need God the most, because without God they can’t do anything good.

When they feel sad and suffer, they pray and sometimes wish they could die and be with Christ. Then they understand fully that true safety and peace can’t be found on earth.

Chapter 13: How to Fight Temptation

As long as we live in this world, we will face suffering and temptation.

That’s why it’s written in Job: "Life is like a battle." Everyone needs to watch out for temptation and pray so the devil, who never stops trying to trick us, doesn’t fool us. No one is perfect or completely holy, so everyone faces temptation sometimes.

Even though temptations are hard and annoying, they can help us by teaching us lessons, making us humble, and cleaning our hearts. Saints went through many temptations and learned from them, but those who gave in lost their way. No matter how holy or hidden a place is, temptations will still come. We can’t avoid them because they come from inside us—because we were born with sin. When one temptation goes away, another one will come. We will always have struggles because we lost a perfect state long ago.

Many people try to run away from temptations but end up falling even worse. We can’t win just by running; we need patience and true humility to become stronger than our problems. If someone only tries to avoid temptations on the outside without fixing the root causes, the temptations will come back even stronger.

Slowly, with patience and endurance, you will overcome temptations with God’s help—not by being harsh or rushing. It also helps to get advice often.
