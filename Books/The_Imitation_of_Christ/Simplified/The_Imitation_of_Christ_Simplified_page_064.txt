THE DISCIPLE  
Lord, Your short talk is full of meaning and very powerful. It doesn’t have many words, but it’s full of important lessons. If I could just follow it well, I wouldn’t get upset so easily. Whenever I feel troubled or sad, I realize I haven’t been following Your teaching. But You, who can do anything and always care about what’s best for me, please help me grow in grace so I can keep Your words and save my soul.

A PRAYER AGAINST BAD THOUGHTS  
Lord my God, don’t stay far from me. Please hurry and help me because I have many worries and fears inside that hurt my soul. How can I get through them without being hurt? How can I make them go away?

“You will go ahead of me,” You say, “and bring down the powerful people. I will open prison doors and show hidden secrets.” Please do what You say, Lord, and make all bad thoughts disappear from me. My hope and comfort is to run to You when I’m in trouble, to trust You, call on You with all my heart, and wait patiently for Your help.

A PRAYER FOR ENLIGHTENING THE MIND  
Good Jesus, please shine Your light inside me and take away all darkness in my heart. Help me stop my mind from wandering and fight off the strong temptations that attack me. Fight for me and defeat these bad desires of the flesh, so I can have peace through Your power and my conscience can be pure and full of praise. Like You calm the sea and the wind, please bring calm to my heart.

Send Your light and truth to shine on me, because I’m like empty earth until You fill me. Pour Your grace from above and shower my heart with heaven’s blessings. Open springs of devotion in me so I can grow good fruits. Lift my heart that’s weighed down by sin and guide my desires toward heavenly things, so after tasting true happiness, I won’t want to think about just earthly stuff.

Save me and take me away from the temporary comforts of things around me, because nothing made by humans can truly satisfy me. Join me to Yourself in a strong love, because only You can satisfy someone who loves You. Without You, everything else means nothing.
