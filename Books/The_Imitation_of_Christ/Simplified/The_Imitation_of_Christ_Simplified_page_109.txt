O Lord, I bring all the wrong things I have done since I first knew how to sin up to now to Your altar. Please burn them away with Your love, wash away every mistake, clear my mind of all guilt, and give me back Your kindness that I lost by sinning. Please forgive me completely and welcome me with Your peace.

What can I do about all my sins except admit them honestly, feel sorry, and keep asking for Your mercy? Please hear me when I come to You, God. My sins upset me a lot. I don’t want to do them again. I’m sorry now and will be sorry forever. I’m ready to make up for them as much as I can.

Please forgive me, God, for the sake of Your Holy Name. Save my soul, which You saved by Your precious Blood. I trust You and put myself in Your hands. Please treat me kindly, not like the bad person I have been.

I also give You all the good things I have, even if they are small and imperfect. Please make them purer and holier. Please accept them and make them better so You will be pleased. Help me, even though I’m lazy and not very good, to have a good and happy life.

I offer You the good wishes and needs of Your faithful followers, my family, friends, brothers, sisters, and everyone I care about. Also, those who have been kind to me or others for Your sake, and all who have asked me to pray for them, whether they are alive or have died. Please give them Your grace, comfort, protection, and save them from punishment. Let them be free from all harm and happily thank You.

I also offer these prayers and this special sacrifice for those who have hurt me, made me sad, or spoken badly about me, and for everyone I have ever hurt, upset, or offended, whether on purpose or by accident. Please forgive us all for hurting each other.

Please take away from our hearts all doubt, anger, fights, and anything that hurts love and kindness between us. Have mercy on those who ask for it, give help to those who need it, and make us good so we can enjoy Your favor and live forever with You.

Chapter Ten: DO NOT SKIP HOLY COMMUNION THE VOICE OF CHRIST

You need to come back often to the source of grace and God’s mercy, to the place of goodness and perfect purity, if you want to be free from bad habits and wrong desires. If you want to be stronger and more careful against the tricks and temptations of the devil, you must keep coming back.
