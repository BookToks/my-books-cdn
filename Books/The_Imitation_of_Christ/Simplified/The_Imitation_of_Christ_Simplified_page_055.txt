Chapter 13  
THE IMPORTANCE OF OBEYING OTHERS, FOLLOWING JESUS’ EXAMPLE  

Jesus’ voice says, "My child, if you try to avoid obeying, you miss out on God’s grace.  

Also, if you only care about what benefits you, you lose the good things that everyone shares.  

If you don’t willingly obey those in charge, it shows that your selfish desires still fight against you.  

So, learn quickly to obey your leaders if you want to control your selfish feelings. It’s easier to fight outside problems if you don’t let your inner self fall apart. The hardest enemy is yourself when you’re not in tune with God’s spirit.  

You must truly look down on yourself if you want to win over your selfish nature.  

Right now, you love yourself too much and are afraid to fully give up control to others. But is it really a big deal for you—just dust and nothing—to obey people for God’s sake? Remember, I, the all-powerful God who made everything, humbled Myself and obeyed humans for your sake. I became the lowest of all to help you overcome pride with My humility.  

Learn to obey, you who are just dust! Learn to be humble, you who are made of earth and clay, and bow down to everyone! Learn to give up your own will and accept being under others. Fight hard against your pride! Don’t let any pride live inside you. Be so humble that people can walk over you like dust on the street!  

What right do you, a proud person, have to complain? What can you say when people accuse you, a sinner who has often hurt God and deserved punishment? But I have spared you because your soul matters to Me. I want you to know My love, always be thankful, and keep living in true humility and patience, even when others treat you badly."  


Chapter 14  
THINK ABOUT GOD’S SECRET JUDGMENTS SO YOU DON’T GET PROUD ABOUT YOUR GOOD DEEDS  

A follower says, "Lord, Your judgments scare me. You shake me with fear, and my soul is very afraid. I’m amazed that even the heavens aren’t pure to You. If You punished the angels for their sins and didn’t spare them, what will happen to me?"
