Chapter Four: Being Careful with Your Choices  
Don’t just do whatever you feel like or follow every idea that pops into your head. Think carefully and patiently about what you do, and try to understand what God wants. Sometimes, sadly, we’re weak and believe or say bad things about others instead of good things. But people who are mature don’t believe every rumor because they know people often mess up and say wrong things.

It’s really smart not to act too quickly, not to stick stubbornly to your opinions, and not to believe or spread every piece of gossip you hear.

Talk to someone wise and honest. Ask for advice from people who know better instead of always doing what you want.

Living a good life makes you wise in God’s eyes and teaches you a lot. The more humble you are and the more you follow God, the wiser and calmer you’ll be in everything.

Chapter Five: Reading the Bible  
When you read the Bible, look for truth, not fancy words. Read every part with the attitude it was written. The Bible is meant to help you, not just to sound nice.

Also, read simple and sincere books as much as you do serious and complicated ones. Don’t care about who wrote it, whether they’re famous or not. What matters is the truth in what they say. People pass away, but God’s truth lasts forever. God can talk to us in many ways, no matter who the person is.

Sometimes, we get too curious and try to understand everything in the Bible too much, when we should just read and keep moving.

To get the most from the Bible, read it with humility, honesty, and faith. Don’t try to look smart. Listen carefully to what saints say, and don’t ignore old sayings—they have good reasons.

Chapter Six: Controlling Your Wants  
When someone wants something too much, they get uncomfortable and stressed. A proud person who always wants more never feels at peace. But a poor and humble person lives peacefully.

A person who doesn’t control their desires is easily tempted and falls into small mistakes quickly. Their spirit is weak and focused too much on physical things, so they find it hard to resist earthly desires.
