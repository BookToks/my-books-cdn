When Jesus was alive, people didn’t like Him. When He really needed help, even people who knew Him left Him alone and treated Him badly. He was okay with being treated badly and suffering. So, do you really have a reason to complain? Jesus had enemies who said bad things about Him. Do you expect everyone to like you and help you? You can’t earn rewards for being patient if you never face hard times. You can’t be a true friend of Jesus if you don’t accept some struggles. If you want to be with Jesus forever, be ready to suffer with Him.

If you had ever felt close to Jesus or felt His strong love, you wouldn’t care about being comfortable or uncomfortable. Instead, you would be happy even when people treat you badly because loving Him makes you forget about yourself.

A person who truly loves Jesus and cares about what’s right, and who controls their feelings, can turn to God anytime and feel calm inside.

The person who understands life for what it really is—not just what others say—is truly wise in God’s way, not just in people’s way.

Someone who learns to live with peace inside and doesn’t focus too much on outside stuff doesn’t need special places or times to pray or be kind. A spiritual person quickly calms down because they don’t waste time worrying about outside things. No outside problem or busy work can stop them. They can handle whatever happens. If you have a calm mind, you won’t get upset by other people’s weird or bad behavior, because you only get upset when you focus too much on outside things.

If everything in your life was perfect and you were free from all sin, everything would work out for you. But since you still care too much about earthly things and aren’t free from sin, many things will bother you. Nothing hurts a person’s heart more than being too attached to things in this world. But if you don’t depend on outside comfort, you can think about heavenly things and feel joy inside.

Don’t worry about who likes you or who doesn’t. Instead, make sure God is with you in everything you do. Keep your conscience clear, and God will protect you. People’s evil can’t hurt someone God wants to help. If you can suffer quietly, you will feel God’s help. He knows when and how to help you, so trust Him. It’s God’s job to help and free people from trouble.

It’s often good for others to see your mistakes and correct you because it helps you become humble. When you are humble because of your mistakes, it’s easier to make peace with others and calm people who are angry.

God protects and saves humble people. He loves and comforts them. He helps them grow after they admit their mistakes. God shares His secrets with the humble and invites them to come close to Him.
