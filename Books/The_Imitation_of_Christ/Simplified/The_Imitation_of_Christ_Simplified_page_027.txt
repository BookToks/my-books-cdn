Every bad habit has its own punishment. People who are proud will feel confused, and those who are greedy will suffer from having nothing. One hour of pain in the afterlife will be worse than a hundred years of punishment here. In life, people sometimes take breaks and enjoy time with friends, but those who are damned never get rest or comfort.

So, you need to be careful and say sorry for your sins now, so that on the day of judgment you can be safe with the good people. On that day, the kind and fair will stand strong against those who hurt them, and those who accepted being judged by people now will get to judge others later. The poor and humble will feel confident, but the proud will be scared. Those who were seen as foolish for following Jesus will actually be wise then.

On that day, every hard thing you patiently went through will be worth it, and the voices of evil will be quiet. The faithful will be happy, but those who ignored God will be sad. A body that suffered will be happier than one that was spoiled with fun. Then, a simple outfit will look beautiful, and fancy clothes will look old and worn. A small, poor house will be praised more than a fancy palace. Patience will be more powerful than all the strength in the world; simple obedience will be better than being clever; a clear conscience will bring more joy than the smartest ideas; and not caring about money will matter more than all the treasures on earth.

You will find more comfort in praying seriously than in eating fancy food. You will be glad you stayed quiet instead of gossiping a lot.

Good deeds will be worth more than many nice words; living strictly and doing hard penances will be better than all the fun in the world.

So learn to handle small troubles now so you don’t have to face bigger ones forever. Test yourself here to see what you can handle later. If you can only deal with a little pain now, how will you survive endless suffering? If a small problem makes you give up now, what will hell’s fire do? You can’t have two joys: you can’t enjoy the world’s pleasures and then live with Christ forever.

If your life so far has been full of fun and honors, what good is it if you die right now? Everything is useless except loving God and serving only Him.

Someone who loves God with all their heart doesn’t fear death, punishment, judgment, or hell, because perfect love brings you close to God.

It’s no surprise that people who still love sin are scared of death and judgment.

But it’s good that even if love doesn’t stop you from doing bad things yet, at least fear of hell does. A person who stops fearing God won’t stay good for long and will soon fall into the devil’s traps.
