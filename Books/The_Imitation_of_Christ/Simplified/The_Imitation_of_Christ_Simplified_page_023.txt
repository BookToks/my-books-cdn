Fight like a man. Habits are broken by forming new habits. If you leave people alone, they will leave you alone to do what you need to do. Don’t worry about other people’s business or get involved in your bosses’ problems. Focus mainly on yourself and remind yourself to do better instead of telling your friends what to do.

If people don’t like you, don’t let it make you sad. But it is serious if you don’t act in a way that fits someone who serves God and tries to live a good life.

It’s often better and safer to have few comforts in life, especially physical ones. But if you don’t feel God’s comfort or feel it only rarely, it’s your fault because you don’t accept sadness and you hold on to meaningless pleasures.

Think of yourself as not worthy of God’s comfort and more deserving of trouble. When someone is truly sorry for their mistakes, the whole world feels sad and tiring to them.

A good person always finds reasons to feel sorry and cry; whether they think about themselves or others, they know everyone suffers. The more they look at themselves, the more sad they become.

The sins and bad habits we are stuck in, that stop us from thinking about heaven, are reasons to feel true sorrow inside.

I’m sure you would try harder to fix yourself if you thought more about dying soon instead of living a long life. And if you really thought about the pain of hell or purgatory, you’d work hard and not be afraid of problems. But since we don’t think about these things enough and like easy pleasures, we become cold and don’t care much. Our weak bodies complain easily because our souls aren’t alive enough.

So, pray humbly to God to give you a sorry heart and say with the Prophet: "Feed me, Lord, with the bread of sadness and give me tears to drink in full measure."

Wherever you are and wherever you go, you will feel unhappy unless you turn to God. So don’t be upset when things don’t go your way. Does anyone have everything they want? No — not me, not you, not anyone. No one, not even the Pope or a king, is free from problems and pain.

Who is better off then? It’s the person who suffers something for God. Many weak people say: "Look how well that person lives, how rich and powerful they are." But you should look up to the riches of heaven and know that material things mean nothing.

These things are uncertain and heavy because you never truly own them.
