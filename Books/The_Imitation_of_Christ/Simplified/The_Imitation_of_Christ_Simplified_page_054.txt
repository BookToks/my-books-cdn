Chapter Twelve: Learning Patience in Fighting Temptations

Student: Patience, Lord, is really important for me because life has a lot of problems. No matter what I plan to be peaceful, my life still has struggles and sadness.

Jesus’ Voice: You’re right, my child. But I don’t want you to look for peace without any troubles or fights. Instead, you should feel peaceful when you go through many hard times and challenges.

If you think you can’t handle suffering now, how will you get through the fire of purgatory?

Between two bad things, always choose the less bad one. So, to avoid worse punishments later, try to patiently bear your current troubles for God’s sake.

Do you think rich or happy people don’t have problems or have very few? Ask them, and you’ll see it’s not true. You might say they have fun and do what they want, so they don’t feel their problems much. That’s true, but how long does that last?

Those who do well in this world will disappear like smoke, and no one will remember their happy times. Even now, their pleasures come with sadness, tiredness, and fear. Often, the things they think make them happy also bring them pain. That’s fair because they chase after fun without thinking, so they shouldn’t enjoy it without feeling some shame or sadness.

All these pleasures are short, fake, silly, and shameful!

But people don’t see this because they are blind like animals, and they risk losing their souls just to enjoy a temporary life.

So, my child, don’t follow your desires. Turn away from your own wishes.

“Find your joy in the Lord, and He will give you what you want.” If you want real happiness and comfort from Me, then by ignoring worldly things and giving up cheap pleasures, you will be blessed and feel great comfort. The more you stop looking for comfort in people or things, the sweeter and stronger your comfort will be in Me.

At first, you won’t get these blessings without feeling sad, working hard, and struggling.

Your old habits will fight you, but better habits will win. Your body will complain, but your spirit’s passion will control it. The devil will try to bother you, but prayer will scare him away, and steady, good work will stop him.
