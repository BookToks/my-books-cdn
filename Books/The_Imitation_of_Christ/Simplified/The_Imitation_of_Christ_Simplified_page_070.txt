What I give, I can also take back whenever I want. What I give still belongs to Me, so when I take it away, I’m not really taking anything from you. Every good and perfect gift comes from Me.

If I send you problems and hard times, don’t worry or feel sad. I can lift you up quickly and turn your sadness into happiness. I am still fair and deserve praise even when I treat you this way.

If you think clearly and see things as they really are, you shouldn’t be so upset by hard times. Instead, you should be happy and thankful, because I allow you to go through pain and don’t protect you from it. I told My followers, “As the Father loved Me, I love you,” and I didn’t send them to have easy lives. They faced big struggles, disrespect, hard work, and no rest, but they produced great results by being patient. Remember these words, My child.

The Thirty-First Chapter

The disciple says, “Lord, I still need a lot more help if I want to reach the place where nothing and no one can stop me. As long as something holds me back, I can’t come freely to You.” Someone once said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove, so I could fly away and find rest!” They wanted to be free to come to You. Who is more peaceful than the one who wants only God? And who is freer than the person who wants nothing on earth?

It’s best to leave behind everything, give up selfishness completely, and realize that You, the Creator, are unlike anything else. Unless a person is free from all created things, they can’t fully focus on God.

The reason there are so few people who truly think deeply about God is because few know how to completely separate themselves from things that don’t last.

For this, you need great help from God—help that lifts your soul above yourself. Unless a person’s spirit is raised up, free from everything else, and fully joined to God, all their knowledge and stuff don’t really matter. Anyone who thinks anything is greater than the one eternal good will stay small and stuck on the earth. Anything that isn’t God is nothing and should be treated as nothing.

There’s a big difference between the wisdom of a holy, wise person and the knowledge of a smart scholar. Wisdom that comes from God is much better than knowledge earned only by hard work.

Many people want to think deeply about God, but they don’t want to do what it takes. Another big problem is being happy with only outside things and feelings and not really giving up selfish desires. I don’t know what it is, or...
