BOOK THREE INTERNAL COMFORT  
The First Chapter  
THE INNER CONVERSATION OF CHRIST WITH THE FAITHFUL SOUL  

I will listen to what the Lord God says inside me.  

A soul is lucky when it hears the Lord speaking inside and feels comfort from His words. Lucky are the ears that hear God's quiet voice and ignore the noise of the world. Lucky are the ears that listen not to outside sounds, but to the truth inside.  

Lucky are the eyes that close to outside things and focus on what’s inside. Lucky are those who look deeply inside themselves and try every day to understand important mysteries. Lucky are those who want to spend their time with God and stay away from distractions in the world.  

Think about these things, my soul, and shut the door to your senses so you can hear what the Lord your God says inside you. “I am your safety,” says your Beloved. “I am your peace and your life. Stay with Me and you will find peace.”  

Forget all things that pass away and look for what lasts forever. What are all temporary things but traps? And what good can anything help you if your Creator leaves you?  

So leave all those things and be good and faithful to your Creator so you can find true happiness.  

The Second Chapter  
TRUTH SPEAKS INSIDE WITHOUT WORDS  

The disciple says, “Lord, speak, for your servant is listening.”  

“I am your servant. Help me understand your rules… Turn my heart toward your teachings… Let your words come gently like dew.”
