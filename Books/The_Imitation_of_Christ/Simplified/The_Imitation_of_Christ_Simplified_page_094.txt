Follow Me. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Without the Way, you can't move forward. Without the Truth, you can't understand. Without the Life, you can’t really live. I am the Way you need to follow, the Truth you should believe, the Life you can hope for. I am the perfect Way, the true Truth, and the never-ending Life. I am the straight path, the highest Truth, the real, blessed, and eternal Life.

If you stay in My Way, you will know the Truth. The Truth will set you free, and you will have eternal life.

If you want to have life, follow My rules. If you want to know the truth, believe in Me. If you want to be perfect, give up everything. If you want to be My follower, put yourself last. If you want the blessed life, stop caring about this world’s stuff. If you want to be great in heaven, be humble here on earth. If you want to rule with Me, be ready to carry the Cross with Me.

Only those who follow the Cross find true happiness and real light.

THE DISCIPLE Lord Jesus, Your path is hard and people don’t like it, so please help me not to care about what the world thinks and to follow You. A servant isn’t greater than his master, and a student isn’t above the teacher. Let me learn from Your life, because that is where I find true salvation and holiness. Nothing else I hear or read makes me feel this alive or happy.

THE VOICE OF CHRIST My child, now that you know all this and have read it, you will be happy if you do it. If someone has My rules and follows them, that person loves Me. I will love them back, show Myself to them, and let them be with Me in My Father’s Kingdom.

THE DISCIPLE Lord Jesus, as You said, so be it. I want to receive what You promised. I have taken the cross from Your hand, and I will carry it, even if it costs me my life, just like You said. The life of a good religious person is hard like a cross, but it leads to heaven. We have started — we can’t turn back or stop now.

Be brave, friends, let’s move forward together and Jesus will be with us. We took this cross for Jesus’ sake. For Jesus’ sake, let’s keep carrying it. He will help us and lead us. Our King goes before us and will fight for us. Let’s follow Him like true warriors. Don’t be afraid of anything. Let’s be ready to face death bravely. Let’s not lose our honor by running away from the Cross.
