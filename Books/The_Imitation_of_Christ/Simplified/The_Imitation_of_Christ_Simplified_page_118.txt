All creatures in heaven and on earth, including me and everyone I pray for, praise and glorify You forever, Lord.

Please accept, God, my promises and wishes to give You endless praise and thanks, which You truly deserve because You are so great. I want to do this every day and every moment. In my prayers, I ask all the angels and faithful people to join me in praising and thanking You.

Let all people, no matter their background or language, praise You with joy and love. And let everyone who respectfully celebrates this great Sacrament and receives it with full faith find Your kindness and mercy. Please have them pray for me, a sinner. When they have felt close to You and are comforted and refreshed after receiving this Sacrament, may they remember my soul.

Chapter 18: People should not try to understand this Sacrament out of curiosity, but instead humbly follow Christ and trust faith over reason.

Be careful not to examine this amazing Sacrament too closely, or you might fall into doubt. If you look too hard, its greatness might overwhelm you.

God can do more than we can understand. He allows a humble search for truth, one that is ready to learn and follow the teachings of the Church.

It's better to be simple and follow God's commands than to argue about things you don’t understand. Many people have lost their faith because they tried to understand things beyond them.

You need faith and a sincere life, not a smart mind or deep study of God’s mysteries. If you can’t understand things below you, how can you understand what’s above you? Trust God and let faith guide your reason. God will give you understanding as much as you need. Sometimes people have strong doubts about faith and the Sacrament, but these worries come from the enemy, not from themselves.

Don’t be upset or argue with these doubts. Don’t listen to the doubts the devil sends you. Believe God’s words, the saints, and the prophets, and the devil will run away. It can actually help God’s servants to face these kinds of troubles.

Satan doesn’t bother unbelievers and sinners he already controls, but he often tempts and troubles faithful people.

So go ahead with strong and honest faith. Approach this Sacrament with humility and respect. Whatever you don’t understand, trust in God’s protection. God won’t trick you, but people who only trust themselves will be fooled.
