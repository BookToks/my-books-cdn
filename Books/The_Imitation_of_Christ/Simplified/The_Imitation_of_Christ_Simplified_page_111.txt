Whenever he thinks deeply about the mystery and love of Jesus becoming human, and feels strong love for Him, he connects with Him in a special way and feels quietly refreshed inside.

If someone only gets ready for Jesus when special days come or because it’s expected, they will often feel unready. Lucky is the person who offers themselves to God every time they celebrate or connect with Him.

Don’t be too slow or too fast when celebrating, but follow the usual way people around you do it. You shouldn’t make things hard for others, but follow the rules set by leaders and think about what helps others, not just what you want.

Chapter Eleven: THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE HOLY SCRIPTURES ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR A FAITHFUL SOUL

Dear Lord Jesus, how happy is the soul that enjoys You at Your special meal, where the only food is You, her one true love, the most wanted thing in her heart!

For me, it would be true happiness to cry tears of love in front of You and, like Mary Magdalene, wash Your feet with them. But where is that deep love and those many tears now? Surely, before You and Your holy angels, my whole heart should be on fire and weeping with joy. Even though You are hidden in a different form, I really have You with me in the Sacrament.

My eyes couldn’t handle seeing You in Your full divine brightness, and the whole world couldn’t stand the shining of Your glory. So, by hiding Yourself in the Sacrament, You care for my weakness.

I truly have and worship the same Jesus the angels worship in heaven — I by faith, they see Him clearly. I must be happy with the true faith’s light and follow it until the day comes when I see everything clearly, and the shadows disappear. When that perfect time comes, we won’t need sacraments anymore because those in heaven don’t need healing signs. They enjoy God forever, seeing His glory face to face, changed from their own light to God’s bright light, tasting the Word of God made flesh, as He was in the beginning and will be forever.

Even thinking about these amazing things, all spiritual comfort feels tiring to me because as long as I don’t see the Lord in His full glory, I think everything I hear and see on earth doesn’t matter much.

You know, God, that nothing can comfort me or give me peace except You, my God, whom I want to look at forever. But this can’t happen while I’m still alive, so I must be very patient and trust You with all my wishes.
