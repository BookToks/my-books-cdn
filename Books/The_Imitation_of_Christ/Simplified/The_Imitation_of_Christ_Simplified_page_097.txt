So, people who only care about their own selfish pleasures shouldn’t argue about God’s holy people. These people change things based on what they want, not what is actually true. Many of them don’t really understand, especially those who haven’t learned much and can’t love others in a pure, spiritual way. They are still tied to natural feelings and friendships, and they guess about heaven based on what they see here on Earth. But there’s a huge difference between what imperfect people imagine and what truly enlightened people understand from God’s revelation.

Be careful, then, my child, not to get too curious about things you don’t understand. Instead, focus on trying to be part of God’s kingdom, even if you feel small. Even if someone knows who is holier or greater in heaven, it doesn’t help unless it makes them humble and praise God more.

A person who thinks about how big their sins are and how small their good deeds are, and how far they are from perfect saints, is more pleasing to God than someone who argues about who is greater or smaller. It’s better to pray sincerely and humbly ask the saints for help than to waste time trying to figure out their secrets.

The saints are happy if people stop arguing and just accept things. They don’t brag about themselves because they know all their good comes from God’s love. They love God so much and are so joyful that they have everything they need. The more humble the saints are, the closer they are to God and the more God loves them. That’s why it says they lay their crowns before God and worship Him forever.

Many people ask who is the greatest in heaven, but they don’t even know if they will be there at all. Even being the least in heaven is amazing because everyone there is great since they are God’s children. The least will be like a thousand, and sinners won’t last. When Jesus’ followers asked who is greatest, He said, “Unless you become like little children, you won’t enter heaven. Whoever humbles themselves like a child is the greatest.” So, those who refuse to be humble won’t get in. Also, rich people who only enjoy life here will be left out when the poor enter God’s kingdom. So, humble people, be happy, because the kingdom of God is yours if you live truthfully.
