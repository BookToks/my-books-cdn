Chapter Thirteen

WITH ALL HER HEART, A DEVOUT SOUL SHOULD WANT TO BE CLOSE TO CHRIST IN THE SACRAMENT

Let me find You alone, O Christ. Let me open my whole heart to You, enjoy You like my soul wants, and not be bothered by anyone. Let me not be distracted by anything else, so You can speak to me and I can speak to You alone, like a lover talks to the one they love, or friends talk with each other.

I pray for this and want this, so I can be completely joined with You and take my heart away from everything else. I want to learn to enjoy the heavenly and eternal through Holy Communion and going to Mass often.

Ah Lord God, when will I be fully joined with You and wrapped up in You, forgetting myself completely? You in me and I in You? Please let us stay like this. You are truly my Beloved, chosen above all, and my soul is happy to live with You every day. You are my true peace, the one who gives the greatest peace and real rest. Without You, there is only hard work, sadness, and endless pain.

You really are the hidden God. You don’t share Your secrets with the wicked, but You talk with the humble and simple.

O how kind is Your Spirit, Lord! To show Your love for Your children, You feed them with the sweetest bread, bread that came down from heaven! Surely no other people are as lucky as those who have their God close. You, our God, are everywhere for the faithful, giving Yourself to be eaten and enjoyed to comfort them every day and lift their hearts to heaven.

What other nation is as famous as Christians? What creature under heaven is as blessed as the devoted soul who receives God, feeding on His glorious Flesh? O amazing gift! O wonderful kindness! O love beyond measure, given especially to us!

What can I give back to the Lord for this love, this endless gift? Nothing pleases Him more than giving my whole heart to God, joining it closely with His. Then my whole self will be happy when my soul is perfectly joined with God. Then He will say to me, “If you stay with Me, I will stay with you.” And I will answer, “Please, Lord, stay with me. I want to be with You. This is my only wish—that my heart be joined with You.”

How great is Your kindness, O Lord, hidden from those who fear You!
