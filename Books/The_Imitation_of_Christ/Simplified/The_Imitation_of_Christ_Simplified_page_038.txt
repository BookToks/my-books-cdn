Jesus says, "If you overcome, I will let you eat from the Tree of Life." This means that God’s comfort helps people be stronger when facing hard times, and challenges come so they don’t get too proud about the good things they do.

The devil never takes a break, and our human desires aren’t gone either. So, you always need to be ready to fight, because there are enemies all around you who never stop.

Chapter Ten: UNDERSTANDING GOD’S GRACE

Why do you look for rest when you were made to work? Learn to be patient instead of always looking for comfort, and be ready to carry your struggles instead of just enjoying life.

Who wouldn’t want comfort and spiritual happiness? These are better than any fun or pleasure you get from the world. Earthly pleasures are often shallow or mean, but true spiritual joy, which comes from God and good choices, is pure and really good.

But temptation can come at any time, and thinking you’re free or too confident in yourself can block these special moments from God. So, you can’t just enjoy them whenever you want.

God gives the gift of comfort, but people do wrong when they don’t thank Him properly. Grace can’t fill us when we’re ungrateful. It always goes to those who are humble and thankful. What is given to humble people is taken away from those who are proud.

I don’t want comfort if it stops me from feeling sorry for my mistakes, and I don’t want deep thinking that makes me proud. Not everything that seems great is holy, not all sweet things are good, not every wish is pure, and not everything we love pleases God. I accept the grace that makes me more humble and ready to give up my own will.

A person who has learned from God’s grace, and from losing it when it’s taken away, will never think they’re good on their own. They will admit they need God. Give God what belongs to Him, and take responsibility for your own mistakes.

Thank God for His grace, but blame yourself and accept punishment for your own faults.

Always take the lowest place, and the highest will be given to you. The greatest people in God’s eyes are those who think of themselves as the least. The more humble they are, the more glorious they become. Because they don’t want to show off, they are full of truth and heavenly honor. They trust God for all the good they have, don’t look for praise from others, and only want God to be praised in themselves and all His people — this is their main goal.
