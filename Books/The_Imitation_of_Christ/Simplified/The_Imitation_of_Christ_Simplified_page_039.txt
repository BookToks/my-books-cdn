Be thankful for even the smallest gift, and you’ll be ready to receive something bigger. Treat the smallest gift like it’s the best, and the least important like it’s special. If you remember who is giving the gift, no gift will seem too small or useless. Even if He gives punishments or hardships, accept them because He does what’s best for us in everything that happens.

If you want to keep God’s kindness, be thankful when you have it and patient when you don’t. Pray that it comes back, and be careful and humble so you don’t lose it.

Jesus has always had many people who love His kingdom in heaven, but only a few who are willing to carry His cross. Many want comfort, but few want to face hard times. He has lots of people who share His meals, but few who join Him in fasting. Everyone wants to be happy with Him, but few want to suffer for Him.

Many follow Him to eat bread, but few want to share in His suffering. Lots of people admire His miracles, but few want to face the shame of the Cross. Many love Him when life is easy, and praise Him when they get comfort. But if Jesus seems to leave them for a while, they complain or feel very sad.

On the other hand, those who love Jesus just because of who He is, not for comfort, thank Him in every trouble and sadness, as well as in happy times. Even if He never gives them comfort, they keep praising Him and want to always thank Him. Pure love for Jesus is very powerful — love that doesn’t care about what you get back.

People who only want comfort are like workers who only work for money. Those who think only about what benefits them love themselves more than Jesus. Who will serve God just to serve Him, without wanting anything back?

Very few people are truly spiritual enough to give up everything. And who is so free in spirit that they don’t depend on anything or anyone? People like that are very rare and valuable, like treasures from faraway places.

If someone gives all their money, it’s not enough; if they do a lot of penance, it’s still little; if they learn everything, they are still far from perfect; even if they have great goodness and devotion, they still miss something very important. What is that one thing? It’s to give up everything, including yourself — to stop thinking about yourself and your own desires.

When someone has done everything they think they should do, they should still see it as nothing. They should think little of what seems great and honestly call themselves a servant who doesn’t deserve much. Because Jesus said, “When you have done all these things, say: ‘We are unprofitable servants.’”
