Bad habits and not caring about growing spiritually often make us say things we shouldn’t. Talking seriously about spiritual things, especially with others who feel the same way, really helps us grow closer to God.

We would feel much more peaceful if we didn’t worry about what others say or do, because that’s not our business. How can someone who always interferes in things that don’t concern them, who looks for distractions, and who rarely thinks deeply inside, live peacefully?

People with simple hearts are truly blessed because they find a lot of peace.

Some saints were so perfect and focused because they gave up all their selfish desires. This helped them connect with God fully and think deeply about spiritual things.

We often get caught up in what we want or in things that don’t last. We hardly ever completely beat even one bad habit, and we don’t really try to get better each day. Because of this, we stay cold and don’t care much. If we controlled our bodies perfectly and kept our minds free from distractions, we could understand God better and feel a bit of heavenly peace.

The biggest problem is that we don’t get rid of our selfish desires and bad habits, so we don’t follow the saints’ example. When things get a little hard, we get discouraged and look for comfort from people instead of God. But if we tried to be brave like soldiers, God would surely help us. He gives us chances to fight for victory and is ready to help those who keep going and trust in Him.

If we only focus on the outside rules of religion, our faith will fade fast. So, we should go deep and get rid of our bad habits to find true peace.

If we could stop just one bad habit every year, we would become perfect very soon.

But usually, it’s the opposite — we think we were better and more passionate about God when we first started than we are now, even after many years.

Our love for God and progress should grow every day, but now it’s seen as something special if someone can even keep a little of their first excitement.

If we pushed ourselves a bit at the beginning, it would be easier and more joyful to do everything later on. Breaking old habits is hard, but it’s even harder to go against what we want.

If you don’t fight small temptations, how will you handle bigger ones? Stop bad habits early before they turn into worse ones.

If you think about how peaceful a good life can make you and how happy it will make others, you’ll want to grow spiritually more.
