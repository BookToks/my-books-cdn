I’m more likely to go backward than forward. I don’t stay the same all the time because I change like the seasons. But my situation gets better quickly when You want it to and when You help me. Only You, without anyone else’s help, can make me strong enough so my heart won’t change anymore but will stay with You. If I knew how to give up all other comforts—whether to grow closer to You or because I have to when no one else can help—then I could hope for Your kindness and be happy with the new comfort You give.

Thank You, because everything good comes from You when I feel well. In Your eyes, I am nothing and weak. So why should I be proud or want people to think highly of me? That’s all useless. The worst kind of useless pride is thinking too much of myself because it pulls me away from real honor and stops me from getting Your grace. When someone is happy with themselves, they upset You. When they want people’s praise, they lose true goodness. But real honor and happiness come from being proud of You, not myself, and being glad for Your name instead of my own, and only liking other things because of You.

Let Your name be praised, not mine. Let Your work be praised, not mine. Let Your holy name be blessed, but don’t let people praise me. You are my honor.

You make me happy. In You, I will be proud and joyful all day, and I will only be proud of my weaknesses.

Let other people look for honor from others. I will look for honor that comes from God only. All human praise, all temporary honor, and all worldly status are really useless and silly compared to Your forever honor. Oh my Truth, my Mercy, my God, Holy Trinity, to You alone be praise, honor, power, and glory forever and ever.

The Forty-First Chapter: NOT CARING ABOUT EARTHLY HONOR  
The voice of Christ: My child, don’t be upset if you see others getting honored and going up while you are looked down on and made humble. Look up to Me in heaven, and you won’t be hurt by what people think on earth.

The disciple: Lord, we get fooled and confused by pride. If I really think about it, no one has ever really hurt me, so I have no good reason to complain to You. But I have sinned a lot against You, so every person is against me. I deserve to be confused and looked down on, but You deserve all the praise, honor, and glory. Unless I get ready to be willingly ignored and forgotten by everyone, to be seen as nothing, I won’t have peace inside, strength, or be close to You in my soul.
