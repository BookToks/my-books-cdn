Chapter Thirty-Five  
THERE IS NO SAFE PLACE FROM TEMPTATION IN THIS LIFE  

My child, in this life you are never truly safe, and you will always need the tools of the spirit. You live among enemies. You can be attacked from any side. So, if you don’t protect yourself everywhere with patience, you won’t stay unharmed for long.

Also, if you don’t keep your heart focused on Me and stay determined to endure everything for My sake, you won’t be able to handle this tough fight or win the reward of heaven. You should go through all of this bravely and fight strongly against anything that tries to stop you. Those who win will get heavenly rewards, but those who are lazy and don’t fight will face a lot of suffering.

If you expect to find rest in this life, how will you ever reach true, forever rest? Get ready not for a lot of rest, but for great patience. Look for real peace not on earth but in heaven; not in people or things but only in God. Because of your love for God, accept all things gladly—work and pain, temptations and problems, worries, weaknesses, needs, insults, criticisms, humiliations, confusion, corrections, and being looked down on. These help you grow in goodness. These are the challenges that make a true follower of Christ. These will earn you a heavenly crown. For a short time of hard work, I will give you a crown that lasts forever, and for a moment of shame, I will give you glory that never ends.

Do you think you will always feel comforted in your spirit like you want? The holy people before you didn’t always have that. Instead, they had many troubles, different temptations, and deep sadness. But they patiently accepted them all. They trusted God, not themselves, knowing that the hard things of this life aren’t worth comparing to the glory coming later. And you—do you want right away what others barely got after many tears and hard work?

Wait for the Lord, be brave, and have courage. Don’t lose hope. Don’t give up but always offer your body and soul to honor God. I will reward you greatly. I will be with you in every trouble.

Chapter Thirty-Six  
THE MEANINGLESS OPINIONS OF PEOPLE  

My child, trust the Lord fully and don’t be afraid of what people think when your conscience tells you that you are honest and innocent. It is good and blessed to go through these things, and they won’t feel heavy on a humble heart that trusts God instead of itself.
