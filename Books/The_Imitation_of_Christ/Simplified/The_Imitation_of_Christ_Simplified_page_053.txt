Chapter Eleven  
THE LONGINGS OF OUR HEARTS MUST BE CHECKED AND CONTROLLED  

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
My child, you need to learn many things that you don’t understand well yet.  

THE DISCIPLE  
What things, Lord?  

THE VOICE OF CHRIST  
You need to make your wishes match what I want completely, and not just love yourself but work hard to do My will. Your desires often make you feel crazy and push you to act, but think about whether you are doing it to honor Me or just for yourself. If it’s for Me, you will be happy with whatever I decide. But if you want things just for yourself, it will bother you and weigh you down.  

Be careful not to trust your own desires too much if they don’t connect to Me, or you might regret them later and be unhappy with what you first thought was best. Not every desire that seems good should be followed right away, and also not every opposite feeling should be ignored immediately.  

Sometimes it’s good to slow down even when you want something good, so you don’t lose focus or cause problems for others. Also, don’t get upset and fall apart if others don’t agree with you. But other times, you need to be strong and fight against your own selfish wants. Don’t listen to what your body wants all the time; make sure your spirit controls it, even if you have to force it.  

You should train your body to be happy with little, enjoy simple things, and not complain about problems.
