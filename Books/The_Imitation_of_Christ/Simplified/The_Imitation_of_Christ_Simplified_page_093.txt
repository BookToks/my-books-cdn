So, God, deep inside me, I love Your law because I know Your rules are good, fair, and holy. They show me why I need to avoid all bad and sinful things. But in my body, I keep giving in to wrong desires instead of thinking clearly. That’s why I want to do good, but I don’t always know how. I try to do many good things, but when it gets hard, I often give up because I don’t have enough help to stay strong.

I understand what perfect behavior looks like and know how I should act, but my own weaknesses hold me back from doing better.

That’s why I really need Your help, Lord, to start doing good things, to keep going, and to finish them! Without Your help, I can’t do anything, but with Your strength, I can do everything through You. Your grace is amazing—it’s more important than any natural talent or good qualities we have.

Before You, Lord, all talents, money, beauty, strength, or smarts don’t matter without Your grace. Natural gifts are shared by both good and bad people, but the special gift for Your chosen people is grace or love. Those who have it are worthy of eternal life. Grace is so important that without it, even amazing miracles, deep thoughts, or faith don’t count. Not even faith, hope, or other virtues are good enough without love and grace.

O wonderful grace, which makes humble people rich in good qualities, and makes proud people humble, please come to me quickly. Fill me with comfort so I don’t get too tired or lose hope.

I ask You, Lord, to give me grace because it’s enough for me even if I don’t get what I naturally want. If I face temptation or hard times, I won’t be afraid as long as Your grace is with me. It’s my strength, my guide, my helper, stronger than my enemies and wiser than the smartest people. It teaches me truth, discipline, and lights up my heart. It comforts me when I’m sad, chases away fear, grows my devotion, and makes me cry with love. Without grace, I am like dead wood, useless and ready to be thrown away.

So please, Lord, let Your grace go before me and follow me, and help me always want to do good things, through Jesus Christ, Your Son.

Chapter 56: We Should Give Up Ourselves and Follow Christ by Carrying Our Cross

Jesus says, “My child, the more you stop focusing on yourself, the more you will be close to Me. Giving up things outside brings peace inside, and giving up yourself brings you closer to God. I want you to learn how to fully accept My will without arguing or complaining.”
