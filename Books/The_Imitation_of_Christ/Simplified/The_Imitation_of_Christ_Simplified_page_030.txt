BOOK TWO THE INTERIOR LIFE  
The First Chapter  
MEDITATION  

Jesus says, "The kingdom of God is inside you." So, turn to God with all your heart. Leave behind this broken world, and your soul will find peace. Learn to ignore outside things and focus on what’s inside you. Then you will see God’s kingdom come to you—a kingdom full of peace and joy, given only to those who believe.  

Christ will come to you and comfort you if you make your heart a good place for Him to live. His beauty and glory come from inside you, and that’s what He loves.  

He often visits your inner self. His connection with you is sweet and comforting. He gives you great peace and a close friendship that is amazing.  

So, good soul, get your heart ready for this special Guest so He can live inside you. Jesus says, "If anyone loves Me, they will keep My words, and My Father will love them, and We will come to them and live with them." Let Christ in, but don’t let anyone else take His place. When you have Christ, you have everything you need. He will take care of you and give you what you want. You don’t need to rely on weak, changeable people. Christ is always with us, strong and steady.  

Don’t trust too much in weak and mortal people, even if they seem kind. Don’t be too upset if they disagree or argue with you. People who are your friends today may turn against you tomorrow, and the opposite can happen too because people change like the wind. Trust only in God; let Him be your fear and your love. He will help you and do what’s best for you.  

You don’t have a permanent home here. You are a stranger and traveler wherever you are, and you won’t find real rest until you are fully joined with Christ.  

Why do you keep looking around here when this isn’t your real home? Think about heaven instead and only glance quickly at the things of this world. They all disappear, and you will disappear too. Be careful not to hold on to them too much or you will get trapped and lost. Keep your mind on God above, and pray to Christ all the time.  

If you don’t know how to think about heavenly things, focus on Jesus’ suffering and look at His holy wounds with love. If you do this, you will find great comfort during hard times. You won’t care much about what others think, and you will be able to ignore their mean talk.
