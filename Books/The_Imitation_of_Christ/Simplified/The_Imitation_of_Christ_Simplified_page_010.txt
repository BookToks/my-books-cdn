If someone makes God the center of everything, sees everything connected to Him, and finds God in all things, then they can feel calm and peaceful inside.

God, You are the truth. Please help me love You forever. Sometimes I get tired of all the things I hear and read, but in You, I find everything I want. Let the smart people be quiet, let all creatures be silent before You; only You speak to me.

The more a person focuses on God and keeps a simple heart, the easier it is for them to understand deep things because they get wisdom from above. A pure and steady spirit doesn’t get distracted by many tasks because they do everything to honor God. Since they have peace inside, they don’t want things just for themselves. What causes more problems than wanting too much?

A good and faithful person plans what to do not based on selfish feelings but on what is right.

Who has to work harder than someone trying to control themselves? This should be our goal: to beat our own weaknesses, get stronger each day, and grow in goodness.

Every good thing in life has some flaws, and no knowledge is perfect. Knowing yourself honestly is a better way to God than just trying to learn a lot. Learning isn’t bad—knowledge is good and given by God—but having a clear conscience and living a good life is more important. Many fail because they want to be smart instead of living well.

If people spent as much effort fixing bad habits and building good ones as they do arguing about ideas, there would be less evil and problems in the world and in churches. On the day we are judged, we won’t be asked what we read, but what we did; not how well we talked, but how well we lived.

Think about this: where are now all the teachers and experts you knew who were famous for what they learned? Others have replaced them, and I don’t know if they even remember those before them. They seemed important while alive, but now people rarely think of them. How fast does worldly fame disappear! If only they had lived as well as they studied, then their learning would have meant something.

Many people fail because they care too much about useless worldly knowledge and not enough about serving God. They became proud because they wanted to be great instead of humble.

The person who truly matters is the one who loves others deeply. The person who is truly great thinks little of themselves and doesn’t care about the highest honors. The one who is truly wise sees all earthly things as foolish to gain Christ. The person who does God’s will and gives up their own way is truly wise and learned.
