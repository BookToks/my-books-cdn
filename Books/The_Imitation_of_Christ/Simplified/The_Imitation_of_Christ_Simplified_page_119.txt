God is close to honest people, shows Himself to those who are humble, helps pure minds understand, and stays hidden from those who are nosy and full of themselves.

Human thinking is not always strong and can be tricked. But true faith cannot be tricked. Reason and science should come after faith, not before it or against it. In this special and holy Sacrament, faith and love are the most important and work in a quiet way.

God is eternal, beyond understanding, and all-powerful. He does amazing and mysterious things in heaven and on earth, and no one can fully understand His amazing works. If all of God’s works were easy for people to understand, they wouldn’t be called wonderful or beyond words.
