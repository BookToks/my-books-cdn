Chapter 59: Put All Your Hope and Trust in God Alone

The disciple asks, “Lord, what can I really trust in this life? What is the greatest comfort I have under the sky? Isn’t it You, God, whose kindness never ends? Where have I ever done well without You? And how could things go wrong when You are with me? I’d rather be poor with You than rich without You. I’d rather wander the earth with You than have heaven without You. Where You are, there is heaven, but where You are not, there is death and hell.

You are what I want most, so I cry out to You, sigh, and pray. No one else can fully help me when I’m in trouble, only You, my God. You are my hope.

You give me confidence and comfort; You are always faithful when I need help.

Everyone else looks out for themselves, but You care about saving me and helping me first. Even when You allow me to face hard times and tests, it’s because You want what’s best for me. I shouldn’t love or praise You less during tough times than when You fill me with peace and joy.

So, Lord God, I put all my hope and trust in You. I give You all my worries and pain because everything else feels weak and unsure without You. Having many friends won’t help me, nor will powerful people, smart advice, books, money, or even a safe place. None of those things can truly help me if You don’t comfort, guide, protect, and teach me. Things that seem to bring peace and happiness mean nothing without You.

You are the source of all good things, the highest life, and the deepest truth. Trusting You above everything else is the greatest comfort for Your followers.

My God, Father of kindness, I look to You and trust in You. Please bless and make my soul pure so it can be Your holy home and show Your glory forever. Let nothing in me offend You. In Your great kindness, hear the prayer of Your poor servant who feels far from You, living in a shadowy, dark place. Protect me through all the dangers in this life and guide me with Your grace on the path of peace to the land of eternal light.
