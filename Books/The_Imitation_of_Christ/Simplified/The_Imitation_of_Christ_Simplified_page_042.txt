If you want to be friends with the Lord and share life with Him, accept the challenges He gives you with love. Let God comfort you in His own way. Be ready to face hard times and think of them as a kind of comfort, because even if you went through all the pain alone, it’s nothing compared to the amazing life waiting for you.

When you reach the point where suffering feels okay and even good for Jesus’ sake, consider yourself lucky—you’ve found a kind of heaven here on earth. But if suffering bothers you and you try to run away from it, you’ll stay unhappy, and the problems will keep following you. If you focus on what really matters, like suffering and death, you’ll feel better and find peace.

Even if you could go to the highest heaven like Paul did, that doesn’t stop you from having to suffer. Jesus said He would show people how much they must suffer for His name. So if you want to love Jesus and serve Him forever, suffering is part of your life.

If you were honored to suffer for Jesus, think about how great that would be—how much joy it would bring to other believers and how much it would inspire people around you! Everyone respects patience, but very few want to actually be patient.

So you should be willing to suffer a little for Jesus, especially since many people suffer way more for things that don’t really matter.

Remember, you need to live a life where you die to yourself; the more you stop focusing on yourself, the more you truly live for God.

No one is ready for heaven unless they accept that they must go through hard times for Jesus. Nothing pleases God more or helps you more here on earth than choosing to suffer for Christ. If you had to choose, it’s better to suffer for Jesus than to just enjoy comfort, because that makes you more like Jesus and the saints. Our growth comes not from enjoying life but from facing tough times.

If there was anything better or more helpful for saving people than suffering, Jesus would have shown it by what He said and did. But He clearly tells His followers to take up their cross every day and follow Him. So after reading all this, remember: we must go through a lot of suffering to enter God’s kingdom.
