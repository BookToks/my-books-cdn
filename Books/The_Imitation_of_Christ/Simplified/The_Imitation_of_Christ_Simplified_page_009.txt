Chapter Two: Being Humble About Yourself

Everyone naturally wants to learn new things, but what’s the point of knowing a lot if you don’t respect God? A simple person who serves God is better than a proud smart person who ignores their soul to study stars. When you really understand yourself, you don’t think you’re better than others, and you don’t feel good just because people praise you.

If I knew everything in the world but didn’t have love and kindness, what good would it do me before God, who judges us by what we do?

Don’t be too eager to learn everything, because it can cause stress and confusion. Smart people like to show off and be called wise, but many things they learn don’t help the soul. It’s unwise to focus on things that don’t help you be a better person.

Talking a lot won’t make your soul happy; living a good life calms the mind, and having a clear conscience helps you trust God more.

The more you know, the harder you will be judged if your life isn’t good. So don’t be proud of how much you’ve learned or what you can do. Instead, be careful and humble about your talents. If you think you understand many things, remember there’s still a lot you don’t know. Don’t pretend to be wise; admit when you don’t know something. Why think you’re better than others when many know more or have more experience?

If you want to learn and appreciate what really matters, be happy to stay unnoticed and think of yourself as nothing special. Truly knowing yourself and not thinking too highly of yourself is the best advice. Always think well of others. If you see someone doing something wrong, don’t think you’re better because you don’t know how long your good luck will last. Everyone is weak, but you should admit you are the weakest.

Chapter Three: The Truth

You’re lucky if you see the truth clearly—not just through signs or words that disappear, but as it really is. Our opinions and senses often trick us, and we understand very little.

What’s the point of arguing about confusing things when we won’t be blamed for not knowing them on Judgment Day? Ignoring important things and worrying about useless stuff is very foolish.

We have eyes but don’t really see.

So why bother with complicated philosophy? The person who listens to the Eternal Word (God’s message) doesn’t need to guess or argue. Everything comes from this Word, and everything speaks about it—the Beginning who also speaks to us. Without this Word, no one can understand or judge things correctly.
