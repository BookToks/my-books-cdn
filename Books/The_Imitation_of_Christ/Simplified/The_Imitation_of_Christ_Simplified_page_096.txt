Chapter 58: Don’t Try to Figure Out God’s Secret Plans

My child, be careful about talking or wondering why some people seem forgotten by God while others are blessed with great gifts. Or why some people go through hard times and others are lifted up. These things are too big for us to understand, and no argument or explanation can fully explain God’s decisions.

When bad thoughts like these come into your mind, or when others ask you about these things, answer like the prophet said: “The Lord is fair, and His decisions are right.” God’s judgments should be respected, not questioned, because they are too deep for people to understand.

Also, don’t argue about which saints are holier or who will be greater in heaven. These talks only cause fights and useless arguments. They make people proud and cause jealousy when one person tries to praise one saint more than another.

Wanting to know all these things doesn’t help anyone. Instead, it makes the saints unhappy because God is not the God of fights, but of peace—a peace that comes from being humble, not from showing off.

Some people might feel more love for certain saints, but this is just a human feeling, not a holy one. I am the one who made all the saints. I gave them their gifts and brought them to glory. I knew them long before the world began. I chose them out of the world—they didn’t choose Me. I called them with kindness, helped them through hard times, gave them comfort, helped them keep going, and rewarded their patience. I know all of them, from the first to the last. I love them all so much. I should be praised in every saint and honored above all in those I have chosen, even though they had no special worth before.

If someone looks down on even the smallest saint, they are not honoring the greatest ones either, because I made both the small and the great. If someone disrespects a saint, they are also disrespecting Me and everyone in heaven. All the saints are united by love. They share the same thoughts and will, and they love each other. But even more, they love Me more than themselves or their own good deeds. They go beyond loving themselves and are completely focused on loving Me, where they find rest. Nothing can pull them away or make them sad because those who are filled with eternal truth burn with an unending love.
