Chapter Twelve: How to Get Ready for Communion with Jesus

I love purity and give all holiness. I want a pure heart because that’s where I rest.

Get your heart ready like a big, clean room, and I will come to celebrate with you and My friends.

If you want Me to stay with you, get rid of all the bad stuff in your heart. Shut out the noisy, bad things of the world. Be quiet like a lonely bird on a roof, and think about your mistakes with sadness.

When you love someone, you always get your place ready to welcome them. This shows how much you care.

But remember, you can’t make yourself ready perfectly, even if you try for a whole year. It’s only by My kindness that you can come to My table, like a poor person invited to a rich person’s dinner who can only say thank you.

Do what you can and do it carefully. Receive the Body of the Lord—your God who wants to come to you—not because it’s routine, but with respect, fear, and love.

I am the One who called you. I made this happen. I will help you with what you lack. Come and receive Me.

If I give you the feeling of devotion, thank God—not because you deserve it, but because I showed mercy. If you don’t feel it and feel dry instead, keep praying, sigh, and ask until you get some help from Me.

You need Me. I don’t need you. You don’t come to make Me holy, but I come to make you holy and better. You come to unite with Me, get new grace, and change for the better. Don’t miss this chance. Get your heart ready and bring in your Beloved.

You should not only get ready before Communion but also stay devoted after receiving it. Taking care of yourself afterward is just as important because it helps you get more grace. If your mind wanders to other things, it can make you feel bad.

Don’t talk too much. Stay quiet and enjoy being with God because you have Him, and no one can take Him away.

I am the One you should give yourself to completely, so you can live not for yourself but in Me, letting go of all worries.
