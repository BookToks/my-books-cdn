But now I often feel sad and upset because I’m unhappy. Many bad things happen to me in this hard life, and they bother me a lot. They make me feel down and block me from being close to You or enjoying the warm love You always want to give to those who believe in You.

Please let my sadness and all the pain I feel on earth move You.

O Jesus, shining with eternal glory, comfort for those who are searching, I don’t speak out loud, but my silence talks to You. How long will You wait to come? Please come to Your poor servant and make me happy. Reach out and take this miserable person away from pain. Come soon, because without You, there is no happy moment for me. You are my happiness, and without You, my life feels empty. I feel trapped and weighed down until You fill me with Your light, set me free, and show me kindness. Let others look for whatever they want, but nothing pleases me except You—my God, my Hope, my forever Salvation. I won’t stop praying until Your grace comes back to me and You say inside me: "Look, I am here. I have come because you called Me. Your tears and your humble heart brought Me to you." Lord, I have called You, wanted You, and was ready to give up everything for You. You were the first to make me want to find You. Thank You, Lord, for showing me so much kindness because of Your great mercy.

What else can Your servant say except that he is always aware of his sins and feels humble before You? Nothing in heaven or earth is like You. Your works are amazing, Your judgments are true, and You control everything. So, may You be praised and honored, Wisdom of the Father. Let my lips, my soul, and everything created join together to praise and bless You.

CHAPTER 22: REMEMBER GOD’S MANY GIFTS

Open my heart, Lord, to Your teachings and help me follow Your commandments. Help me understand what You want. Let me remember all Your blessings, every single one, with respect and care so I can thank You properly. I know I can’t fully thank You for even the smallest gifts. I don’t deserve the good things You’ve given me, and when I think about Your generosity, I feel overwhelmed. Everything I have, inside and out, in my body and soul, by nature or by grace, is from You. These gifts show how good and merciful You are, and we have received all good things from You.
