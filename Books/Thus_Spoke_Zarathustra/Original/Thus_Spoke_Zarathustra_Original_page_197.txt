Your proudest of captives, You robber 'hind the cloud-banks… Speak finally!
 
 You lightning-veiled one! you unknown one! Speak!
 
 What will you, highway-ambusher, from - me?
 
 What will you, unfamiliar - God?
 
 What?
 
 Ransom-gold?
 
 How much of ransom-gold?
 
 Solicit much - that bids my pride!
 
 And be concise - that bids my other pride!
 
 Ha! Ha!
 
 Me - want you? me?
 
 -Entire?… Ha! Ha!
 
 And torture me, fool that you art, Dead-torture quite my pride?
 
 Give love to me - who warms me still?
 
 Who loves me still?Give ardent fingers Give heartening charcoal-warmers, Give me, the lonesomest, The ice (ah! seven-fold frozen ice For very enemies, For foes, does make one thirst).
 
 Give, yield to me, Cruellest foe, -Yourself! - Away!
 
 There fled he surely, My final, only comrade, My greatest foe, My unfamiliarMy hangman-God!… -No!
 
 Come you back!
 
 With all of your great tortures!
 
 To me the last of lonesome ones, 197 Oh, come you back!
