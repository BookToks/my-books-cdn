"INTO your eyes gazed I lately, O Life: gold saw I gleam in your nighteyes, - my heart stood still with delight: -A golden bark saw I gleam on darkened waters, a sinking, drinking, reblinking, golden swing-bark!
 
 At my dance-frantic foot, do you cast a glance, a laughing, questioning, melting, thrown glance: Twice only moved you your rattle with your little hands - then did my feet swing with dance-fury.My heels reared aloft, my toes they listened, - you they would know: has not the dancer his ear - in his toe!
 
 to you did I spring: then fled you back from my bound; and towards me waved your fleeing, flying tresses round!
 
 Away from you did I spring, and from your snaky tresses: then stood you there half-turned, and in your eye caresses.
 
 With crooked glances - do you teach me crooked courses; on crooked courses learn my feet - crafty fancies!
 
 I fear you near, I love you far; your flight allures me, your seeking secures me: - I suffer, but for you, what would I not gladly bear!
 
 For you, whose coldness inflames, whose hatred misleads, whose flight enchains, whose mockery - pleads: -Who would not hate you, you great bindress, in-windress, temptress, seekress, findress! Who would not love you, you innocent, impatient, wind-swift, child-eyed sinner!
 
 where pull you me now, you paragon and tomboy? And now fool you me fleeing; you sweet romp do annoy!
 
 I dance after you, I follow even faint traces lonely. Where are you? Give me your hand! Or your finger only!
 
 Here are caves and thickets: we shall go astray! - Halt! Stand still! See you not owls and bats in fluttering fray?
 
 You bat! you owl! you would play me foul? Where are we? From the dogs have you learned thus to bark and howl.
 
 You gnash on me sweetly with little white teeth; your evil eyes shoot out upon me, your curly little mane from underneath!
 
 177 This is a dance over stock and stone: I am the hunter, - will you be my hound, or my chamois anon?
