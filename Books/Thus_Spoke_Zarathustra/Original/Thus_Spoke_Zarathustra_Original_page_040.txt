Maintain holy your highest hope! Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (9) THE PREACHERS OF DEATH There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom renunciation life must be preached.
 
 Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the many-toomany. May they be lured out of this life by the "life eternal"!
 
 "The yellow ones": so are called the preachers of death, or "the black ones." But I will show them to you in other colors besides.
 
 There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of prey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration. And even their lusts are self-laceration.
 
 They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach desistance from life, and pass away themselves!
 
 There are the spiritually decaying ones: hardly are they born when they begin to die, and long for doctrines of weariness and renunciation.
 
 They would rather be dead, and we should approve of their wish! Let us beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living coffins!
 
 They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse - and immediately they say: "Life is refuted!" But they only are refuted, and their eye, which sees only one aspect of existence.
 
 Shrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little casualties that bring death: thus do they wait, and clench their teeth.
 
 Or else, they grasp at candy, and mock at their childishness thereby: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their still clinging to it.
 
 Their wisdom speaks thus: "A fool, he who remains alive; but so far are we fools! And that is the most foolish thing in life!" "Life is only suffering": so say others, and lie not. Then see to it that you cease! See to it that the life ceases which is only suffering!
 
 And let this be the teaching of your virtue: "you shall slay yourself! you shall steal away from yourself!" 40 "Lust is sin," - so say some who preach death - "let us go apart and beget no children!
