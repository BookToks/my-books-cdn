But already does it attack me and constrain me, this spirit of melancholy, this evening-twilight devil: and truly, you higher men, it has a longing-Open your eyes! - it has a longing to come naked, whether male or female, I do not yet know: but it comes, it constrains me, Alas. open your wits!
 
 The day dies out, to all things comes now the evening, also to the best things; hear now, and see, you higher men, what devil - man or woman this spirit of evening-melancholy is!" Thus spoke the old magician, looked cunningly about him, and then seized his harp.

 In evening's limpid air, What time the dew's soothings to the earth downpour, Invisibly and unheardFor tender shoe-gear wear The soothing dews, like all that's kind-gentle-: Bethink you then, bethink you, burning heart, How once you thirsted For heaven's kindly teardrops and dew's down-droppings, All singed and weary thirsted, What time on yellow grass-pathways Wicked, occidental sunny glances Through sombre trees about you sported, Blindingly sunny glow-glances, gladly-hurting?
 
 "Of truth the wooer? You?" - so taunted they"No! Merely poet!
 
 A brute insidious, plundering, grovelling, That aye must lie, That wittingly, wilfully, aye must lie: For booty lusting, Motley masked, Self-hidden, shrouded, Himself his bootyHe - of truth the wooer?
 
 No! Mere fool! Mere poet!
 
 Just motley speaking, From mask of fool confusedly shouting, 231 Circumambling on fabricated word-bridges, On motley rainbow-arches, between the spurious heavenly, And spurious earthly, Round us roving, round us soaring,Mere fool!
