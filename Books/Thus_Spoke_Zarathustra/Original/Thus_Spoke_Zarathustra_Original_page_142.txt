For vengeance, you vain fool, is all your foaming; I have divined you well!
 
 But your fools'-word injures me, even when you are right! And even if Zarathustra's word were a hundred times justified, you would ever - do wrong with my word!
 
 Thus spoke Zarathustra. Then did he look on the great city and sighed, and was long silent. At last he spoke thus: I loathe also this great city, and not only this fool. Here and there there is nothing to better, nothing to worsen.
 
 Woe to this great city! - And I would that I already saw the pillar of fire in which it will be consumed!
 
 For such pillars of fire must precede the great noontide. But this has its time and its own fate.This precept, however, give I to you, in parting, you fool: Where one can no longer love, there should one - pass by! Thus spoke Zarathustra, and passed by the fool and the great city.
 
 Part 3, (8) THE APOSTATES 1.
 
 AH, Is everything already withered and grey which but lately stood green and many-hued on this meadow! And how much honey of hope did I carry hence into my beehives!
 
 Those young hearts have already all become old - and not old even!
 
 only weary, ordinary, comfortable: - they declare it: "We have again become pious." Of late did I see them run forth at early morn with valorous steps: but the feet of their knowledge became weary, and now do they malign even their morning valour!
 
 Truly, many of them once lifted their legs like the dancer; to them winked the laughter of my wisdom: - then did they bethink themselves.
 
 Just now have I seen them bent down - to creep to the cross.
 
 Around light and liberty did they once flutter like gnats and young poets. A little older, a little colder: and already are they mystifiers, and mumblers and mollycoddles.
 
 142 Did perhaps their hearts despond, because lonesomeness had swallowed me like a whale?
