And the spirit's happiness is this: to be anointed and consecrated with tears as a sacrificial victim, - did you know that before?
 
 And the blindness of the blind one, and his seeking and groping, shall yet testify to the power of the sun into which he has gazed, - did you know that before?
 
 And with mountains shall the discerning one learn to build! It is a small thing for the spirit to remove mountains, - did you know that before?
 
 You know only the sparks of the spirit: but you do not see the anvil which it is, and the cruelty of its hammer!
 
 Truly, you know not the spirit's pride! But still less could you endure the spirit's humility, should it ever want to speak!
 
 And never yet could you cast your spirit into a pit of snow: you are not hot enough for that! Thus are you unaware, also, of the delight of its coldness.
 
 In all respects, however, you make too familiar with the spirit; and out of wisdom have you often made an alms-house and a hospital for bad poets.
 
 You are not eagles: thus have you never experienced the happiness of the alarm of the spirit. And he who is not a bird should not camp above abysses.
 
 You seem to me lukewarm ones: but coldly flows all deep knowledge.
 
 Ice-cold are the innermost wells of the spirit: a refreshment to hot hands and handlers.
 
 Respectable do you there stand, and stiff, and with straight backs, you famous wise ones! - no strong wind or will impels you.
 
 Have you never seen a sail crossing the sea, rounded and inflated, and trembling with the violence of the wind?
 
 Like the sail trembling with the violence of the spirit, does my wisdom cross the sea - my wild wisdom!
 
 But you servants of the people, you famous wise ones - how could you go with me!Thus spoke Zarathustra.
