Therefore they listen to the preachers of death, and themselves preach afterworlds.
 
 Listen rather, my brothers, to the voice of the healthy body; it is a more honest and pure voice.
 
 More honestly and purely speaks the healthy body, perfect and squared-off: it speaks of the meaning of the earth.
 
 Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (4) THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY To the despisers of the body I want to speak. I would not have them learn and teach differently, but merely say farewell to their own bodies and thus become silent.
 
 "Body am I, and soul" - so says the child. And why should one not speak like children?
 
 But the awakened and the knowing say: "Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only a word for something about the body." The body is a great intelligence, a multiplicity with one sense, a war and a peace, a herd and a shepherd.
 
 An instrument of your body is also your little intelligence, my brother, which you call "spirit" - a little instrument and toy of your great intelligence.
 
 "I," you say, and are proud of that word. But greater is that in which you do not wish to believe - your body with its great intelligence; it does not says "I," but does "I." What the sense feels, what the spirit knows, never has its end in itself.
 
 But sense and spirit would persuade you that they are the end of all things: that is how vain they are.
 
 Instruments and toys are sense and spirit: behind them there is still the self. The self also seeks with the eyes of the senses, it also listens with the ears of the spirit.
 
 Always the self listens and seeks; it compares, overpowers, conquers, and destroys. It rules, and is also the ruler of the "I".
 
 Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, stands a mighty ruler, an unknown sage - it is called the subconscious self; it dwells in your 31 body, it is your body.
