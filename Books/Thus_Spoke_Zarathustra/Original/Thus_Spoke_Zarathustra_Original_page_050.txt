In divining and keeping silence shall the friend be a master: not everything must you wish to see. your dream shall disclose to you what your friend does when awake.
 
 Let your pity be a divining: to know first if your friend wants pity. Perhaps he loves in you the unmoved eye, and the look of eternity.
 
 Let your pity for your friend be hid under a hard shell; you shall bite out a tooth upon it. Thus will it have delicacy and sweetness.
 
 Are you pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to your friend?
 
 Many a one cannot loosen his own fetters, but is nevertheless his friend's emancipator.
 
 Are you a slave? Then you can not be a friend. are you a tyrant? Then you can not have friends.
 
 Far too long has there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman.
 
 On that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knows only love.
 
 In woman's love there is injustice and blindness to all she does not love. And even in woman's conscious love, there is still always surprise and lightning and night, along with the light.
 
 As yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at the best, cows.
 
 As yet woman is not capable of friendship. But tell me, you men, who of you is capable of friendship?
 
 Oh! your poverty, you men, and your sordidness of soul! As much as you give to your friend, will I give even to my foe, and will not have become poorer thereby.
 
 There is comradeship: may there be friendship!
 
 Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (15) THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: thus he discovered the good and bad of many peoples. No greater power did Zarathustra find on earth than good and bad.
 
 No people could live without first valuing; if a people will maintain itself, however, it must not value as its neighbor values.
 
 50 Much that passed for good with one people was regarded with scorn and contempt by another: thus I found it.
