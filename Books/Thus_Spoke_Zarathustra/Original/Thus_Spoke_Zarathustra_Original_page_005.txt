 Note On The Selection Of Books The Nietzsche Love of Fate Series contains the full texts of Nietzsche's eight best and most mature works. The books written before The Dawn (1880) are not as mature as those written later. The Case of Wagner (1888) and Nietzsche Contro Wagner (1888) are too narrow in scope.
 
 The famous book, The Will to Power (1901) is a collection of tentative notes edited, arranged and published by Nietzsche's sister after his death. It's value is surrounded by a great deal of controversy among scholars. The eminent Nietzsche scholar Mazzino Montinari went so far as to call it a "forgery". As Walter Kaufmann said in his introduction to the book, Nietzsche could have included these notes in his published works but he chose not to and therefore it is possible he was not fully satisfied with them. For these reasons the book is not included among his "best 8".
 
 Eternal Recurrence To the Reader, In his autobiography Nietzsche said that Zarathustra was by far his most inspired and most important book, and that the "basic conception of this work" was the idea of "eternal recurrence". This idea is intimately involved with what he calls "love of fate", "that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity." The idea of eternal recurrence, so strange and yet so simple, needs to be 5 considered more than it has been.
