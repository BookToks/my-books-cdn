It is you.
 
 Luckily, you are not separated from the universe. You are not a "ghost in a machine". The ghost would die forever and the machine would come back. You not only have a deep connection, at every instant, with your body, the earth and it's universe. Every instant you are your body, this earth, it's universe and nothing else.
 
 When the exact same universe returns, you're there.
 
 Do I have a Choice, a Chance, to Make Each Return a Little Different ?
 
 A Little Better ?
 
 No choice, no chance, no different, no better … (and no worse).
 
 Each time you return it's exactly the same you. If there were the slightest infinitesimal difference, the butterfly effect would not only radically change your entire life and the future course of human history but radically change the whole future of the universe such that at the incredibly large number of years after which you are supposed to return, you wouldn't be there since the universe would be radically different.
 
 That's how well connected you are to the universe.
 
 If We Are Exactly the Same Each Time, What About Free Will ?
 
 Nietzsche attacked the idea of free will repeatedly and mercilessly: “'free will' … the foulest of all theologians' artifices … has been invented essentially for the purpose of punishment, that is, because one wanted to impute guilt… . we immoralists are trying with all our strength to take the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment out of the world again." "The Twilight of the Idols" Part 5 Section 7, 'The Error of Free Will' 274 If we deny the religious moralist his sado-masochistic pleasure tool, is there any other use for this idea?
