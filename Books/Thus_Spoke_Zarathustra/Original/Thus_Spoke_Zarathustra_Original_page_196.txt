What mean'th this torture With dull, indented arrows?
 
 Why look'st you hither, Of human pain not weary, With mischief-loving, godly flash-glances?
 
 Not murder will you, But torture, torture?
 
 For why - me torture, You mischief-loving, unfamiliar God? Ha! Ha!
 
 You steal close In midnight's gloomy hour?â€¦ What will you?
 
 Speak!
 
 You crowd me, pressestHa! now far too closely!
 
 You hear me breathing, You overhear my heart, You ever jealous one!
 
 -Of what, pray, ever jealous?
 
 Off! Off!
 
 For why the ladder?
 
 Would you get in?
 
 To heart in-clamber?
 
 To my own most secret Conceptions in-clamber?
 
 Shameless one! you unknown one! - Thief!
 
 What seek you by your stealing?
 
 What seek you by your hearkening?
 
 What seek you by your torturing?
 
 You torturer!
 
 You - hangman-God!
 
 Or shall I, as the mastiffs do, Roll me before you?
 
 And cringing, enraptured, frantical, My tail friendly - waggle!
 
 In vain!
 
 Goad further!
 
 Cruellest goader!
 
 196 No dog - your game just am I, Cruellest huntsman!
