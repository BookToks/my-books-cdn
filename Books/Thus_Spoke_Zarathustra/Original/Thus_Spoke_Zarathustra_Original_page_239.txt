) -Sit I here the best of air sniffling, Paradisal air, truly, Bright and buoyant air, golden-mottled, As goodly air as ever From lunar orb downfellBe it by hazard, Or supervened it by arrogancy?
 
 As the ancient poets relate it.
 
 But doubter, I'm now calling it In question: with this do I come indeed Out of Europe, That doubts more eagerly than does any Elderly married woman.
 
 May the Lord improve it!
 
 Amen.
 
 This the finest air drinking, With nostrils out-swelled like goblets, Lacking future, lacking remembrances, Thus do I sit here, you Friendly damsels dearly loved, And look at the palm-tree there, How it, to a dance-girl, like, does bow and bend and on its haunches bob, -One does it too, when one views it long!To a dance-girl like, who as it seems to me, Too long, and dangerously persistent, Always, always, just on single leg has stood?
 
 -Then forgot she thereby, as it seem to me, The other leg?
 
 For vainly I, at least, Did search for the amissing Fellow-jewel -Namely, the other legIn the sanctified precincts, Nigh her very dearest, very tenderest, Flapping and fluttering and flickering skirting.
 
 239 Yes, if you should, you beauteous friendly ones, Quite take my word: She hath, Alas.
