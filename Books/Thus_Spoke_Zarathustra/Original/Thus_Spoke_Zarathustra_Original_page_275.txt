Probably not.
 
 University philosophers have long played entertaining mind games trying to prove free will true or false, but it was not much more than entertainment.
 
 Any "what-if" statement applied to the past is absolutely silly. The butterfly-effect is not an observation but a mathematical aspect of complex systems, and "complex systems" encompasses everything in the universe outside of billiard tables and chemistry-lab test-tubes. It says that any one little "what if this were different" radically changes whatever follows. If I had not gotten that parking ticket in 1972, all four of my children would never have existed.
 
 Seeing everything in your past as fate is wise. It's very close to having no regrets and no resentments.
 
 Seeing your evolving present actions as fate is also wise. Experience, emotion and intelligence flow more smoothly, genuinely and gracefully.
 
 You're not plagued by sputtering "decisions". It's much easier to ride your spirit.
 
 Seeing your future as fate is hardest and wisest of all. Decidophobia (fear of decisions), feeling that choosing one person or path over another will be letting the experience of that other person or path die forever, seeing and being paralyzed by this abyss-fantasy, is a comic situation.
 
 What makes you think you have such god-like powers to see and â€œsave a world"? Life is awareness, experience and feelings, all with a spirit and flow of their own, obeying the iron laws of yin and yang, up and down.
 
 You can never know what that person or path would have been for you and certainly it would not have been all "wonderfulness".
 
 Can I Remember Previous Recurrences?
 
 No. That's silly.
 
 Rare, random, playful, uncontrollable psychic glimpses of the future or deja vu feelings might be possible, but they would come from the 275 world you are living in now, not some cosmic memory that spans a multiple graham number of years.
