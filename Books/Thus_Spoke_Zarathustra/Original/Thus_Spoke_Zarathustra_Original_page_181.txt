Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children, unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity!
 
 For I love you, O Eternity!

 If ever I have drunk a full draught of the foaming spice - and confection-bowl in which all things are well mixed: If ever my hand has mingled the furthest with the nearest, fire with spirit, joy with sorrow, and the harshest with the kindest: If I myself am a grain of the saving salt which makes everything in the confection-bowl mix well:-For there is a salt which units good with evil; and even the evilest is worthy, as spicing and as final over-foaming:Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity, and for the marriage-ring of rings - the ring of the return?
 
 Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children, unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity!
 
 For I love you, O Eternity!

 If I be fond of the sea, and all that is sea-like, and fondest of it when it angrily contradicts me: If the exploring delight be in me, which impels sails to the undiscovered, if the seafarer's delight be in my delight: If ever my rejoicing has called out: "The shore has vanished, - now has fallen from me the last chainThe boundless roars around me, far away sparkle for me space and time, - well! cheer up! old heart!"Oh, how could I not be ardent for Eternity, and for the marriage-ring of rings - the ring of the return?
 
 Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should like to have children, unless it be this woman whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity!
 
 For I love you, O Eternity!

 If my virtue be a dancer's virtue, and if I have often sprung with both feet into golden-emerald rapture: 181 If my wickedness be a laughing wickedness, at home among rosebanks and hedges of lilies: -or in laughter is all evil present, but it is sanctified and absolved by its own bliss:And if it be my Alpha and Omega that everything heavy shall become light, everybody a dancer, and every spirit a bird: and truly, that is my Alpha and Omega!
