Abashed did he draw in his tail, said "bow-wow!" in a cowed voice, and crept down into his cave.Thus told Zarathustra. His disciples, however, hardly listened to him: so great was their eagerness to tell him about the sailors, the rabbits, and the flying man.
 
 "What am I to think of it!" said Zarathustra. "Am I indeed a ghost?
 
 But it may have been my shadow. you have surely heard something of the Wanderer and his Shadow?
 
 One thing, however, is certain: I must keep a tighter hold of it; otherwise it will spoil my reputation." And once more Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. "What am I to think of it!" said he once more.

 Part 2, (19) THE SOOTHSAYER "-AND I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best turned weary of their works.
 
 A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: 'All is empty, all is alike, all has been!' And from all hills there re-echoed: 'All is empty, all is alike, all has been!' To be sure we have harvested: but why have all our fruits become rotten and brown? What was it fell last night from the evil moon?
 
 In vain was all our labour, poison has our wine become, the evil eye has singed yellow our fields and hearts.
 
 Arid have we all become; and fire falling upon us, then do we turn dust like ashes: - yes, the fire itself have we made weary.
 
 All our fountains have dried up, even the sea has receded. All the ground tries to gape, but the depth will not swallow!
 
 'Alas. where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned?' so sounds our plaint - across shallow swamps.
 
 Truly, even for dying have we become too weary; now do we keep awake and live on - in sepulchres." 108 Thus did Zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak; and the foreboding touched his heart and transformed him.
