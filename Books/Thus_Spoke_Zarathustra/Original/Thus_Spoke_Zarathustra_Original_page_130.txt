Meanwhile do I sail along on uncertain seas; chance flatters me, smooth-tongued chance; forward and backward do I gaze-, still see I no end.
 
 As yet has the hour of my final struggle not come to me - or does it come to me perhaps just now? Truly, with insidious beauty do sea and life gaze upon me round about: O afternoon of my life! O happiness before eventide! O haven upon high seas! O peace in uncertainty! How I distrust all of you!
 
 Truly, distrustful am I of your insidious beauty! Like the lover am I, who distrusts too sleek smiling.
 
 As he pushes the best-beloved before him - tender even in severity, the jealous one-, so do I push this blissful hour before me.
 
 Away with you, you blissful hour! With you has there come to me an involuntary bliss! Ready for my severest pain do I here stand: - at the wrong time have you come!
 
 Away with you, you blissful hour! Rather harbour there - with my children! Hasten! and bless them before eventide with my happiness!
 
 There, already approaches eventide: the sun sinks. Away - my happiness! Thus spoke Zarathustra. And he waited for his misfortune the whole night; but he waited in vain. The night remained clear and calm, and happiness itself came closer and closer to him. Towards morning, however, Zarathustra laughed to his heart, and said mockingly: "Happiness runs after me. That is because I do not run after women.
 
 Happiness, however, is a woman." Part 3, (4) BEFORE SUNRISE O HEAVEN above me, you pure, you deep heaven! you abyss of light!
 
 Gazing on you, I tremble with divine desires.
 
 Up to your height to toss myself - that is my depth! In your purity to hide myself - that is my innocence!
 
 The God veils his beauty: thus hide you your stars. you speak not: thus proclaim you your wisdom to me.
 
 130 Mute over the raging sea have you risen for me to-day; your love and your modesty make a revelation to my raging soul.
