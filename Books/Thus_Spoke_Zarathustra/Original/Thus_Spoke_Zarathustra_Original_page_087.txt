Oh, this is the hostility of light to the shining one: unpityingly does it pursue its course.
 
 Unfair to the shining one in its innermost heart, cold to the suns: - thus travels every sun.
 
 Like a storm do the suns pursue their courses: that is their travelling.
 
 Their inexorable will do they follow: that is their coldness.
 
 Oh, you only is it, you dark, nightly ones, that extract warmth from the shining ones! Oh, you only drink milk and refreshment from the light's udders!
 
 Ah, there is ice around me; my hand burns with the iciness! Ah, there is thirst in me; it pants after your thirst!
 
 'Tis night: alas, that I have to be light! And thirst for the nightly! And lonesomeness!
 
 'Tis night: now does my longing break forth in me as a fountain, - for speech do I long.
 
 'Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also is a gushing fountain.
 
 'Tis night: now do all songs of loving ones awake. And my soul also is the song of a loving one. Thus sang Zarathustra.
 
 Part 2, (10) THE DANCE-SONG ONE evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest; and when he sought for a well, behold, he lighted upon a green meadow peacefully surrounded by trees and bushes, where maidens were dancing together. As soon as the maidens recognized Zarathustra, they ceased dancing; Zarathustra, however, approached them with friendly mien and spoke these words: Cease not your dancing, you lovely maidens! No game-spoiler has come to you with evil eye, no enemy of maidens.
 
 God's advocate am I with the devil: he, however, is the spirit of gravity.
 
 How could I, you light-footed ones, be hostile to divine dances? Or to maidens' feet with fine ankles?
 
 To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not 87 afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.
