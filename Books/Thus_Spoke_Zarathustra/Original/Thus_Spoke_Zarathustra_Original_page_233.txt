Even thus, Eaglelike, pantherlike, Are the poet's desires, Are your own desires 'neath a thousand guises.
 
 You fool! you poet!
 
 You who all mankind viewedSo God, as sheep-: The God to rend within mankind, As the sheep in mankind, And in rending laughing That, that is your own blessedness!
 
 Of a panther and eagle - blessedness!
 
 Of a poet and fool - the blessedness! - In evening's limpid air, What time the moon's sickle, Green, between the purple-glowings, And jealous, steal'th forth: -Of day the foe, With every step in secret, The rosy garland-hammocks Downsickling, till they've sunken Down nightwards, faded, downsunken: Thus had I sunken one day From my own truth-insanity, From my own fervid day-longings, Of day weary, sick of sunshine, -Sunk downwards, evenwards, shadowwards: By one sole trueness All scorched and thirsty: -Bethink you still, bethinkst you, burning heart, How then you thirsted?That I should banned be From all the trueness!
 
 Mere fool! Mere poet!
 
 233 Part 4, (15) SCIENCE THUS sang the magician; and all who were present went like birds unawares into the net of his artful and melancholy voluptuousness.
