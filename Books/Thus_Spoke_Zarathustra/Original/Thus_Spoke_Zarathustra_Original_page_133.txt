The world is deep: - and deeper than ever the day could read. Not everything may be uttered in presence of day. But day comes: so let us part!
 
 O heaven above me, you modest one! you glowing one! O you, my happiness before sunrise! The day comes: so let us part! Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 3, (5) ON THE VIRTUE THAT MAKES SMALL 1.
 
 WHEN Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go straightway to his mountains and his cave, but made many wanderings and questionings, and ascertained this and that; so that he said of himself jestingly: "Behold, a river that flows back to its source in many windings!" For he wanted to learn what had taken place among men during the interval: whether they had become greater or smaller. And once, when he saw a row of new houses, he marvelled, and said: "What do these houses mean? Truly, no great soul put them up as its simile!
 
 Did perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy-box? Would that another child put them again into the box!
 
 And these rooms and chambers - can men go out and in there? They seem to be made for silk dolls; or for dainty-eaters, who perhaps let others eat with them." And Zarathustra stood still and meditated. At last he said sorrowfully: "There has everything become smaller!
 
 Everywhere do I see lower doorways: he who is of my type can still go through them, but - he must stoop!
 
 Oh, when shall I arrive again at my home, where I shall no longer have to stoop - shall no longer have to stoop before the small ones!" - And Zarathustra sighed, and gazed into the distance.The same day, however, he gave his discourse on the dwarfing virtue.

 I pass through this people and keep my eyes open: they do not forgive me for not envying their virtues.
 
 They bite at me, because I say to them that for small people, small 133 virtues are necessary - and because it is hard for me to understand that small people are necessary!
