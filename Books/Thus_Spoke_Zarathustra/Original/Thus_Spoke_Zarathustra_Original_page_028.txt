But not much longer do I stand: I am already lying down. When Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he laughed in his heart: for a light had dawned upon him. And thus spoke he to his heart: This wise man seems to be a fool with his forty thoughts: but I believe he knows well how to sleep.
 
 Happy even is he who lives near this wise man! Such sleep is contagious - even through a thick wall it is contagious.
 
 There is even magic in his professorial chair. And not in vain did the youths sit before the preacher of virtue.
 
 His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And truly, if life had no sense, and I had to choose nonsense, this would be the most desirable nonsense for me also.
 
 Now I know well what people sought formerly above all else when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and opiate virtues to promote it!
 
 To all those much praised sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep without dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.
 
 Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honorable: but their time is past. And not much longer do they stand: already they are lying down.
 
 Blessed are those sleepy men: for they soon shall drop off. Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (3) ON BELIEVERS IN AN AFTERWORLD Once on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all believers in an afterworld. The work of a suffering and tortured God, the world then seemed to me.
 
 The dream and fiction of a god, the world then seemed to me; colored smoke before the eyes of a discontented god.
 
 Good and evil, and joy and pain, and I and you - colored smoke did they seem to me before creative eyes. The creator wished to look away from himself; so he created the world.
 
 Drunken joy it is for the sufferer to look away from his suffering and 28 forget himself.
