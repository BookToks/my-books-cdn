"They are my animals," said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in his heart.
 
 "The proudest animal under the sun and the wisest animal under the sun, - they have come to search for me.
 
 They want to know whether Zarathustra still lives. Truly, do I still live?
 
 I have found it more dangerous among men than among animals; on dangerous paths walks Zarathustra. May my animals lead me!
 
 When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words of the saint in the forest, sighed and spoke thus to his heart: "I wish I were wiser! I wish I were wise from the very heart, like my serpent!
 
 But I am asking the impossible. So I ask my pride that it always go along with my wisdom!
 
 And if my wisdom should some day leave me - Ah, how it loves to fly away! - then may my pride fly with my folly!" Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
