We are not different from animals, only they're more awake while we spend most of our time head-dancing in our big frontal lobes.
 
 The thought of eternal recurrence is a means for us to wake up.
 
 How Long Until We Return ?
 
 A very, very, very long time.
 
 How many years? We need a big number. A billion is 1000000000, a 1 with 9 zeros after it. A googol is a number with 100 zeros after the 1. A googolplex is a number with a googol amount of zeros after the 1. Too small. The mathematicians invented the "Graham number" which the Guinness World Records listed as the "World Champion largest number". It is too large to be written in scientific notation because even the digits in the exponent would exceed the number of atoms in the observable universe. Well, even this is much, much, much too small a number of years. We're not talking about shuffling a deck of cards or the sand pebbles of a beach. We're talking about shuffling the position and motion of every atom in the universe. However, eventually there is an incredibly large finite number of years when "the music box repeats it's tune".
 
 This is a long time to wait. To handle the wait the universe gives us the "cheerful magic of death".
 
 The Cheerful Magic of Death To confront the multiple Graham number of years for the return, the cheerful magic of death provides that there is no waiting The moment after you die you "wake up" as the baby you were.
 
 But when the music box plays the tune again - Is it still you?
 
 273 Is it You that Returns or another Person Exactly Like You ?
