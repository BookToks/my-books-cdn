Even a year later Gast says, "He did not look very ill. I almost had the impression that his mental disturbance consists in no more than a heightening of the humorous antics he used to put on for an intimate circle of friends.' … Gast could see he didn't want to be cured : "It seemed - horrible though this is - as if Nietzsche were merely feigning madness, as if he were glad for it to have ended this way". This tallies with Overbeck's feeling when he came to Jena in February: "I cannot escape the ghastly suspicion … that his madness is simulated." [4] (p. 340-41) 44-54 - His mental and physical condition progressively worsens leaving him helpless and unable to write coherently.
