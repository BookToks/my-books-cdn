Their knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies of virtue, but their heart knows naught thereof.
 
 And again there are those who regard it as virtue to say: "Virtue is necessary"; but after all they believe only that policemen are necessary.
 
 And many a one who cannot see men's loftiness, calls it virtue to see their baseness far too well: thus calls he his evil eye virtue.And some want to be edified and raised up, and call it virtue: and others want to be cast down, - and likewise call it virtue.
 
 And thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue; and at least everyone claims to be an authority on "good" and "evil." But Zarathustra came not to say to all those liars and fools: "What do you know of virtue! What could you know of virtue!"But that you, my friends, might become weary of the old words which you have learned from the fools and liars: That you might become weary of the words "reward," "retribution," "punishment," "righteous vengeance."That you might become weary of saying: "That an action is good is because it is unselfish." Ah! my friends! That your very Self be in your action, as the mother is in the child: let that be your formula of virtue!
 
 Truly, I have taken from you a hundred formulae and your virtue's favorite playthings; and now you upbraid me, as children upbraid.
 
 They played by the sea - then came there a wave and swept their playthings into the deep: and now do they cry.
 
 But the same wave shall bring them new playthings, and spread before them new speckled shells!
 
 Thus will they be comforted; and like them shall you also, my friends, have your comforting - and new speckled shells! Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 2, (6) THE RABBLE LIFE is a well of delight; but where the rabble also drink, there all fountains are poisoned.
 
 To everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see the grinning 78 mouths and the thirst of the unclean.
