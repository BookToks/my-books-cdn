Thomas Common's mistaken use of biblical language in translating this book typifies what many readers miss: they can't fully see that Zarathustra is somewhat of a comic figure, a parody on prophets.

 There were no fish … " Today, 123 years later, there still are no fish out there in university culture. Yet professors claim to be the best ones to "explain" Nietzsche to the rest of us.
