But here’s my advice, friends: don’t trust people who really want to punish others!

These people come from bad backgrounds; you can see in their faces the hangman and the hunting dog.

Don’t trust those who talk a lot about justice! Honestly, they don’t have any sweetness in their souls.

And when they call themselves "good and fair," remember that the only thing missing for them to be Pharisees is power!

Friends, I don’t want to be mixed up with others.

Some people teach my ideas about life but also preach equality, and they’re like tarantulas.

They say they support life, but they hide away in their dens, these poison spiders, far from real life – and that’s because they want to hurt.

They want to hurt those who have power now, because for those people, preaching death is normal.

If it were different, these tarantulas would teach something else; after all, they used to be the worst world-haters and burned heretics.

I won’t mix with these equality preachers. Justice tells me: “People are not equal.” And they never will be! How could I love the overman if I said otherwise?

Thousands will gather on bridges and piers in the future, and there will always be more war and unfairness among them: that’s how my great love makes me speak!

They will create ideas and illusions in their fights; and with those ideas and illusions, they will fight the ultimate battle!

Good and evil, rich and poor, high and low, and all kinds of values: these will be weapons and signals showing that life must keep improving itself!

Life will build itself up high with columns and stairs – it will look far into the distance and toward beautiful happiness – that’s why it needs to rise!

Because it needs to rise, it needs steps, different steps and climbers! Life wants to rise and improve itself as it goes up.

And look, my friends! Right where the tarantula’s den is, an old temple’s ruins rise high – just look at it with open eyes!
