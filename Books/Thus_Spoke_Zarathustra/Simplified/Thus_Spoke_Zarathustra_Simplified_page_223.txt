Now, this God is dead. But in front of everyone, we won’t all be equal. You important people, stay away from the busy marketplace!

Before, there was God! But now this God is dead! You important people, this God was your biggest threat.

Only after God died did you rise again. Now is the bright midday, now the higher man becomes the boss!

Do you get what I’m saying, my friends? Are you scared? Does your heart feel dizzy? Does a scary gap open under you? Does a hellhound bark at you?

Well! Be brave, you important people! Now the future of humanity is being worked on. God is dead: now we want the overman to live.

Today, many people ask: "How can humans survive?" But Zarathustra asks, first and only one: "How can humans become better than humans?" The overman is what I care about most — not regular people, not the poorest, not the saddest, not even the best.

My friends, what I love about humans is that they are always changing and moving forward. And in you, there is a lot that makes me believe and hope.

Because you, important people, have looked down on things, that gives me hope. Great haters are also great admirers.

Because you have felt hopeless, there is much to respect. You haven’t learned to just obey or play small games.

Today, small-minded people are in charge: they all say to obey, be humble, be careful, work hard, and follow boring rules.

Whatever is weak, or comes from people who just serve others, especially the mixed-up crowd — they now want to be in control of everyone’s future — Ugh! Gross! Gross!

They keep asking, again and again: "How can people survive best, longest, and happiest?" These people are the rulers today.

You, my friends, go beyond these small-minded people — they are the biggest danger to the overman!

Go beyond small virtues, small politics, tiny worries, useless busywork, weak comfort, and the idea of “the greatest happiness for the most people”!

It’s better to be hopeless than to just obey.
