You might say, "Enjoying small bad things can stop you from doing bigger bad things." But here, you shouldn’t try to hold back.

A bad action is like a painful pimple: it itches, annoys you, and shows itself clearly - it has a kind of honesty.

“It says, ‘I am a problem,’” and that’s its honesty.

But small bad thoughts are like infections: they sneak around, hide, and try not to be noticed – until they ruin everything inside.

If someone has a devil inside them, I’d quietly tell them: “It’s better to face your devil! Even for you, there’s still a way to do something great!”

Oh, my friends! We know a little too much about everyone! Many people seem easy to understand, but we still can’t really get inside their minds.

It’s hard to live with other people because staying quiet is so hard.

We’re not usually unfair to the people who upset us the most, but to those who don’t matter to us at all.

If a friend is hurting, be a safe place for their pain; like a tough, but steady bed. That way, you help them best.

If a friend hurts you, say: “I forgive what you did to me; but how could I forgive what you did to yourself?” That’s what true love says—it goes beyond just forgiving and feeling sorry.

Hold onto your heart tightly; if you let it go, your mind can easily run wild!

Oh, where have there been bigger mistakes than those made by people who feel sorry for themselves? And what has caused more pain than their mistakes?

Bad luck to all who love without rising above their sadness!

Once, the devil told me: “Even God has his hell: it’s his love for humans.” And recently, I heard him say, “God is dead: God died because he felt too sorry for humans.”

So be careful with pity: it can bring a heavy storm to people! I really understand signs of bad weather!

But remember this: all true love is bigger than its pity because it wants to make what it loves grow!

“I give myself to my love, and my neighbor as myself” — that’s what all creators say.
