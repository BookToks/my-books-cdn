The eye of a thief looks at everything shiny and wants it. The hungry person compares themselves to those who have a lot. They always hang around people who give things.

Sickness shows itself as this kind of craving. A sick body is like selfishness that steals.

Tell me, my brother, what do we think is the worst? Isn’t it when someone gets worse and weaker? We always notice this when someone stops caring and giving.

We keep growing and improving. But we hate the feeling that says, "All for me." Our growth is like climbing higher. These climbs are called virtues, or good qualities.

Our body changes through history, always fighting and becoming better. And the spirit? It is the body’s friend, cheering it on and sharing its victories.

Words like “good” and “bad” are just hints, not clear answers. Only a fool tries to learn too much from them!

Listen carefully, my brothers, whenever your spirit tries to speak in hints: that is where your true goodness starts.

Then your body feels lifted up and happy, and it fills your spirit with joy. Your spirit becomes a creator, a judge, a lover, and a giver of good things.

When your heart is full and overflowing like a river, both a blessing and a challenge to those below, that is the start of your goodness.

When you don’t care about praise or blame, and your will controls everything like a loving person’s will, that is the start of your goodness.

When you reject easy pleasures and laziness, and want to be far away from that softness, that is where your goodness begins.

When you want only one will, and changing needs becomes a need for you, that is the start of your goodness.

This is a new kind of good and bad! A new deep feeling and the sound of a new spring!

This new goodness is power; a strong thought with a clever soul around it: a golden sun with the snake of knowledge wrapped around.

Zarathustra stopped for a moment and looked kindly at his followers.

Then he spoke again, his voice different: Stay true to the earth, my brothers, using the power of your goodness!
