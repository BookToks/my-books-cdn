Zarathustra spoke again. From the cave, the higher men laughed and shouted. Then he started talking once more: "They’re biting the bait I set, and their enemy, the heavy spirit that drags them down, is leaving them. Now they’re learning to laugh at themselves. Am I hearing that right?

My strong and powerful words are working. I didn’t feed them weak, boring stuff! I gave them warrior-food, food for winners. I lit new fires in their hearts.

They feel new hopes in their bodies, their hearts grow bigger. They find new words, and soon their spirits will be wild and free.

This kind of food isn’t for kids or even for girls who dream a lot. Their bodies want something else; I’m not here to teach them.

The higher men don’t feel disgust anymore; that’s my win. In my world, they become confident; all their stupid shame disappears; they open up.

They open their hearts, good times come back, they relax and think – they feel thankful.

That’s the best sign to me: they become thankful. Soon, they’ll make festivals and remember their old joys.

They’re healing!" Zarathustra said happily to himself and looked around; his animals came close and respected his happiness and quiet.

Suddenly, Zarathustra got scared. The loud cave suddenly went completely silent. But his nose smelled sweet smoke, like burning pine cones.

"What’s going on? What are they doing?" he wondered and quietly went to the entrance to watch without being seen. But what he saw shocked him!

"They’ve all become religious again, they’re praying, they’re crazy!" he said, amazed. All the higher men—the two kings, the retired pope, the evil magician, the beggar, the wanderer, the old fortune teller, the serious one, and the ugliest man—they all knelt like children and old women and worshiped the donkey.

Then the ugliest man started making strange noises, like something deep inside him was trying to come out. When he finally spoke, look what he said.
