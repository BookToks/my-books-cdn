I would rather give in than deny this one thing; and really, where there is giving in and leaves falling, you see, Life is sacrificing itself – for power!

I have to struggle, grow, have a purpose, and face problems – ah, anyone who understands my will also knows the twisted paths I must walk!

Whatever I make, and no matter how much I love it, I soon have to go against it and against my love: that’s what my will wants.

Even you, smart one, are just a path and step of my will: truly, my Will to Power moves even with your Will to Truth!

The idea "Will to existence" didn’t find the truth: that will doesn’t exist!

Because what isn’t, can’t will; and what already exists – how could it still try to exist!

Only where there is life, is there will: not a Will to Life, but – as I teach you – a Will to Power!

Living beings value many things more than life itself; but from this valuing comes the Will to Power!

This is what Life taught me: and with it, I solve the mystery in your hearts, you wisest ones.

I tell you: good and evil that last forever don’t exist! They must always go beyond themselves again.

With your ideas of good and evil, you exercise power, you who judge: and that is your secret love, the spark and excitement inside you.

But a stronger power grows from your values, a new power that breaks eggs and eggshells.

And anyone who wants to create good and evil first has to be a destroyer, breaking values into pieces.

So, the greatest evil belongs to the greatest good: that is the creative good.

Let’s talk about it, you wisest ones, even if it seems bad. Staying silent is worse; hidden truths become poison.

Let everything break that can be broken by our truths! Many new homes still need to be built! This is what Zarathustra said.

Calm is like the bottom of my sea: who would think it hides weird monsters!
