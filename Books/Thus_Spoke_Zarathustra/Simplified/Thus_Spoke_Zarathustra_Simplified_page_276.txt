Thank goodness we don’t remember everything, because if we did, life would lose its freshness, excitement, and surprises.

Animals dream and probably daydream too, but most of the time, if they haven’t been messed up by humans, they are awake and the world is real and right in front of them. For animals, the world is the main thing in their lives. Humans live differently. Instead of focusing on the real world, they mostly live in their social dreams and ideas, only sometimes paying attention to what’s really around them.

Ancient Eastern teachings talk a lot about calming the mind and waking up to reality. But we’re still tricked by a very old human idea: trying to avoid death by living through our social dreams, morals, hopes, plans, stories, and ideas of good and evil.

Because we believe our life repeats forever, the idea of a “self” becomes less important. This “self” is just what you think other people think about you.

All these social ideas start to seem silly. You’re left just with the world that appears before you.

Eternal Recurrence and the Will to Laughter is the world’s mysterious experience.

Nietzsche thought that the basic force of the world was the “will to power.” I think power is a good idea, but I also suggest it has a partner: the “will to laughter.” This laughter is the world’s joy in its endless, silly dance, the funny side of power, the light feeling of knowing, and the freedom of not needing to fix the world.

We humans waste life running away from the idea of death through pointless social fantasies. We’ve lost the amazing awareness that animals have of their world. What we call our “consciousness” or “mind”—all the noisy thoughts and fantasies—is like a funny clown, always silly.

We haven’t even begun to understand the first big truth of our time: technology actually makes life weaker, not stronger.
