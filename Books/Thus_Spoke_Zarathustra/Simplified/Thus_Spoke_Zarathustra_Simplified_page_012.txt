When he went into the forest, an old man suddenly appeared. He had left his holy hut to look for roots in the forest. The old man said to Zarathustra, "I know this traveler: he passed by many years ago.

His name was Zarathustra, but he has changed.

Back then, you carried your ashes up to the mountains. Now, will you carry your fire down into the valleys? Aren't you afraid of getting punished for starting fires?

Yes, I recognize Zarathustra. His eyes are pure, and there is no hate in his face. Doesn’t he move like a dancer?

Zarathustra is different now; he has become like a child; he is awake. What will you do where people are still asleep?

You lived alone like in the sea, and it kept you safe.

But now, will you come ashore? Will you carry your body by yourself again?" Zarathustra said, "I love people." The saint said, "Then why did I go into the forest and desert? Wasn’t it because I loved people too much?

Now I love God; I don’t love people. People are too imperfect for me. Loving people would hurt me." Zarathustra answered, "I didn’t say I love them. I’m bringing a gift to people." The saint said, "Don’t give them anything. Instead, help carry their burdens – that’s what they’ll like best, if you like it too!

But if you want to give something, only give small gifts, and let them ask for it!" Zarathustra said, "No, I don’t give small gifts. I’m not poor enough for that." The saint laughed and said, "Then make sure they take your gifts! People don’t trust hermits and don’t believe we bring gifts.

Our footsteps sound too lonely on the streets. And at night, when they hear someone walking before sunrise, they wonder: Where is this thief going?

Don’t go to people. Stay in the forest! Go to the animals instead! Why not be like me – a bear with the bears, a bird with the birds?" Zarathustra asked, "What do you do in the forest?"

The saint said, "I make songs and sing them; while making songs, I laugh, cry, growl, and hum: that’s how I praise God."
