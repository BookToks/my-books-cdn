So, some people listen to those who only talk about death and life after death, and then they start talking about that too.

But listen instead, my friends, to the voice of a healthy body; it’s more honest and real.

A healthy body, strong and balanced, speaks more honestly and clearly; it tells us about the true meaning of life on Earth.

This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (4) THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY

I want to talk to those who look down on the body. I don’t want them to learn or teach anything different, just to say goodbye to their bodies and then be quiet.

“A body am I, and soul too,” says a child. And why shouldn’t we talk like children?

But those who are awake and wise say: “I am only my body, nothing else; soul is just a word for something about the body.” The body is very smart, it has many parts working as one, it’s like a battle and peace at the same time, a group and a leader.

Your little mind, which you call “spirit,” is just a tool of your big intelligence, your body.

You say “I,” and you feel proud of that word. But your body, which you don’t want to believe in as much, is even greater; it doesn’t say “I,” it just acts as “I.”

What your senses feel and what your mind knows is never the final thing.

But senses and mind want you to believe they are everything; they are very full of themselves.

Senses and mind are just tools and toys: behind them is the true self. The self also sees through the senses and listens with the mind.

The self is always watching and searching; it compares, wins, controls, and destroys. It rules, and it is also the boss of the “I.”

Behind your thoughts and feelings, my friend, there is a powerful ruler, a hidden wise one — it’s called the subconscious self; it lives in your body, it is your body.
