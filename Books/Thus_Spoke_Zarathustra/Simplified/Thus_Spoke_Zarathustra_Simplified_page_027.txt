You should laugh at least ten times each day and stay happy; if not, your stomach, which causes problems and sadness, will bother you at night.

Not many people know this, but you need to be a good person to sleep well. Should I lie? Should I cheat?

Should I want someone else’s girlfriend? All these things would ruin a good sleep.

Even if you are good, you still need to let your good qualities rest at the right time. Otherwise, they might argue with each other, like little girls! And they might fight over you, poor guy!

Good sleep wants peace with God and your neighbors. And also peace with your neighbor’s troublemaker! Otherwise, they will bother you at night.

Respect the people in charge, even if they are unfair! That’s how you get good sleep. What can I do if those in power act wrongly?

The best leader is the one who leads people to a good place; that helps you sleep.

I don’t want lots of honors or big treasures; they just make me upset.

But without a good reputation and a little money, you don’t sleep well.

I like hanging out with a few good friends more than bad company, but they should come and go at the right time. That helps sleep too.

I really like humble people; they help you sleep. They are lucky, especially if you always tell them they’re right.

This is how a good person spends the day. When night comes, I don’t try to force sleep. Sleep doesn’t like to be forced – it’s the master of good qualities!

Instead, I think about what I did and thought during the day. Slowly and patiently, like a cow chewing grass, I ask myself: What were the ten times I won over myself?

And what were the ten times I made peace, told the truth, and laughed with joy?

Thinking like this, while my mind is busy with many thoughts, sleep comes suddenly – sleep, the master of good qualities who can’t be forced.

Sleep softly touches my eyes, making them heavy. Sleep touches my mouth, leaving it open.

Sleep, the sweetest thief, quietly comes to me and steals 27 of my thoughts: then I stand there, silly, like a wooden chair.
