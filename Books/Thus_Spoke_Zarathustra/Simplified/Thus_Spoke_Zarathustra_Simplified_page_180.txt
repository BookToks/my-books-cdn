If I am a seer, full of the spirit that travels high on mountain ridges, between two seas, moving between the past and the future like a heavy cloud—unfriendly to hot, boring places and to everything tired that can neither die nor live. Ready for lightning inside me, and for the bright flash of light, full of power that says Yes! that laughs Yes! ready for sudden flashes of insight—Blessed is the one who carries this power! And truly, they must wait a long time like a heavy storm on the mountain before they can light up the future! Oh, how could I not be passionate about forever and the ultimate promise—the promise of coming back again?

I have never found a woman with whom I want to have children, except maybe the one I love: because I love you, O Forever!

Because I love you, O Forever!

If my anger has ever broken graves, moved old boundaries, or pushed broken tables into deep holes; if my scorn has scattered old, decayed words into the wind, and if I have come like a broom to sweep away spiders, and like a cleansing wind to old graveyards: If I have ever sat happily where old gods are buried, loving the world even there, beside the monuments of old enemies of the world—because I even love churches and gods’ graves, as long as heaven shines through their broken roofs with clear eyes; I gladly sit like grass and red poppies on ruined churches. Oh, how could I not be passionate about forever, and the ultimate promise—the promise of coming back again?

I have never found a woman with whom I want to have children, except maybe the one I love: because I love you, O Forever!

Because I love you, O Forever!

If I have ever felt the breath of creation, and the powerful force that makes even random things dance like stars; if I have ever laughed with the creative lightning, which is followed by the loud but obedient thunder of action; if I have ever played dice with the gods at the earth’s divine table, making the earth shake and crack, and spit out streams of fire—because the earth is like a divine table, shaking with new powerful commands and the gods’ dice rolls: Oh, how could I not be passionate about forever, and the ultimate promise—the promise of coming back again?
