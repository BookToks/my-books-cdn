Age / Date Finished THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY Age 28 - 1872

Today (in 1886), this book feels impossible for me. I think it’s badly written, heavy, embarrassing, with strange and mixed-up images, and too emotional. It doesn’t follow clear logic. It’s a book for people who really know the topic, like “Music” is for music lovers. It’s an arrogant and wild book that from the start shut itself off from most educated people and even more from regular people.

A better title would have been “Hellenism and Pessimism” because the book tries to show how the ancient Greeks got rid of pessimism and how they overcame it. Tragedy itself shows that the Greeks were not pessimistic. The Greeks will stay mysterious and hard to understand until we answer the question, “What is Dionysian?”
