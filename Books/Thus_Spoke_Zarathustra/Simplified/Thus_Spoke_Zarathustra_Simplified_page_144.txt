Whenever I lift a curtain, a night-moth quickly flies out. 

Maybe it was hiding there with another night-moth? Everywhere I go, I sense small secret groups; and where there are closets, there are new followers, and the feeling of followers is all around.

They spend long evenings together, saying, "Let’s be like little kids again and say, ‘good God!’" — words spoiled by the overly religious people.

Or they watch a sneaky spider that teaches other spiders to be careful and says, "It’s good to spin webs under crosses!" Or they spend all day fishing in swamps and think they’re smart; but if there are no fish, I don’t even call that shallow!

Some learn to play the harp with a hymn-writer who wants to charm young girls — he’s tired of old women praising him.

Others learn to shiver with a half-crazy person who waits in dark rooms for ghosts — but the ghost always runs away!

Some listen to an old wandering musician who has learned to play sad music from the wind and now plays sad songs.

And some have become night-watchmen: they know how to blow horns and walk around at night waking up old things that have been asleep for a long time.

Last night, I heard five words about old things from these sad, tired night-watchmen at the garden wall.

"For a father, he doesn’t care enough for his children; human fathers do this better!" "He’s too old! He doesn’t care for his children anymore," one night-watchman said.

"Does he even have children? No one can prove it unless he proves it himself! I’ve wanted him to prove it clearly for a long time." "Prove? He’s never proved anything! He wants people just to believe him." "Yes! Belief saves him; belief in him. That’s how old people are!"
