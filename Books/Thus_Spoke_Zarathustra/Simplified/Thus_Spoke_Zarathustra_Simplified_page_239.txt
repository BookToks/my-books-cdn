I’m sitting here breathing the best air, really amazing air, bright and fresh, with golden spots. It’s as good as any air that’s ever fallen from the moon—whether by chance or by some kind of proud magic.

That’s what the old poets say.

But if you don’t believe me, I’m asking you now: Am I really out of Europe? Because people there doubt things more than even the oldest married women do.

I hope the Lord makes it better!

Amen.

This is the best air to breathe, filling my nose like cups. I’m not thinking about the future or the past. I’m just sitting here with you, my dear friends, looking at the palm tree.

It bends and moves like a dancer, like one of those girls who always stands on one leg for too long—too long and kind of dangerously.

And I wonder, did she forget she has another leg?

Because I tried to find the missing one, but it’s nowhere to be seen, hidden under her soft, fluttering skirt.

Yes, if you believe me, beautiful friends, she doesn’t have it—unfortunately.
