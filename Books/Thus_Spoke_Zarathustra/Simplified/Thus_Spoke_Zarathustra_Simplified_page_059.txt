Would you listen to this too? For someone who wants to be truly fair in their heart, even lying can become an act of kindness.

But how can I be fair from the heart? How can I give everyone what they deserve? For me, it’s enough to give everyone what’s mine.

Finally, my friends, be careful not to hurt any hermit.

How could a hermit forget? How could he repay you?

A hermit is like a deep well. It’s easy to throw a stone in, but if it sinks to the bottom, who will take it out again?

Be careful not to harm the hermit! But if you do, then, as Zarathustra said, kill him too.

Now, my brother, I have a question just for you. Like dropping a weight into water, I want to see how deep your soul is.

You are young and want a child and marriage. But I ask: are you ready to truly want a child?

Are you someone who has won over yourself, who controls your desires, who masters your good qualities? That’s what I want to know.

Or is your wish just your animal side talking? Or is it because you feel lonely? Or because you are confused inside?

I want you to want a child only after you have won freedom and control. You should build living proof of your victory and freedom.

You should build something beyond yourself. But first, you must build yourself strong and steady in both body and soul.

You should not only pass yourself on to the future but also lift yourself higher! Marriage can help you do this!

You will create a higher self, like a wheel that rolls forward on its own – something creative and alive.

Marriage is when two people want to create something bigger than themselves. It means respecting each other as partners with this goal.

This should be the true meaning of your marriage. But the kind of marriage that most people have—what should I call that?

Ah, the emptiness of soul in those two!
