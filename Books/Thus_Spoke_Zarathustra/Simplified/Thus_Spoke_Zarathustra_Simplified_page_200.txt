"Don’t you know, Zarathustra? I’m looking for Zarathustra." There was a long silence between them. Zarathustra got lost in thought and closed his eyes. After a while, he came back to the moment, took the magician’s hand, and said politely, "Well! Up there is the way, there’s the cave of Zarathustra. You can look for the one you want to find there.

Ask my animals, my eagle and my snake, for advice—they’ll help you search. My cave is big.

As for me, I haven’t met any great people yet. Right now, even the sharpest eyes can’t see what’s truly great. It’s the time of the crowd.

I’ve met many who puffed themselves up, and people shouted, ‘Look, a great person!’ But what good is all that blowing? The wind just comes out eventually.

In the end, the frog that’s been puffed up too long bursts: then the wind escapes. Poking a big, swollen one in the belly is fun. Remember that, boys!

Today belongs to what’s popular: who still knows what’s really big or small? Only a fool can find greatness now. It only works with fools.

You’re looking for great people, you strange fool? Who taught you that? Is this the right time? Oh, bad seeker, why do you mess with me?" Zarathustra said this, feeling comforted, and went on laughing.

Not long after Zarathustra left the magician, he saw a man sitting by the path. The man was tall and black, with a pale, tired face. This man made Zarathustra very sad. "Oh no," he thought, "there’s hidden pain here. I think he’s like the priests. What are they doing in my place?

Just when I escaped that magician, now another sorcerer is in my way—some dark miracle worker, blessed by God, a world-hater, may the devil take him!"
