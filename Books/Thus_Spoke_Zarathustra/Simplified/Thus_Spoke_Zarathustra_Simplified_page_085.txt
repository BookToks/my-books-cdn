The spirit feels happiest when it is chosen and made special through tears, like a sacrifice—did you know that before?

The blind person, even though they can’t see and keep searching, still shows the power of the sun they have looked at—did you know that before?

The wise person will learn to build with mountains! It’s easy for the spirit to move mountains—did you know that before?

You only see little sparks of the spirit, but you don’t see the anvil it strikes on or the hard hammer that hits it!

You don’t really understand the spirit’s pride! And even less could you handle its humility if it ever chose to show it!

You’ve never thrown your spirit into a pit of snow because you’re not hot enough for that! So, you don’t know how refreshing cold can be for the spirit.

In many ways, you treat the spirit too comfortably; and because of your “wisdom,” you’ve made a shelter for weak poets.

You’re not like eagles; that’s why you’ve never felt the spirit’s excitement. If you’re not a bird, you shouldn’t camp on the edge of cliffs.

You seem kind of lukewarm to me, but true deep knowledge flows cold as ice.

The spirit’s deepest parts are ice-cold—a cool relief for those who are passionate and active.

You stand there proud and stiff, famous wise people! No strong wind or force moves you.

Have you never seen a sail crossing the sea, full and shaking because of the strong wind?

Like that sail shaking from the spirit’s power, my wild wisdom crosses the sea.

But you, servants of the people, famous wise ones—how could you follow me? That’s what Zarathustra said.

It’s night now, and all the fountains are louder than ever.
