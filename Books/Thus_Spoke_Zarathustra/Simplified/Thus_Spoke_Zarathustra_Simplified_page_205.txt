Zarathustra! Read my riddle! Tell me, what does it mean to get revenge on someone who saw everything?

I’m calling you back; there’s smooth ice here! Be careful not to let your pride make you slip and fall!

You think you’re smart, proud Zarathustra! Then read my riddle, you tough nut to crack—it’s me! Tell me, who am I?

When Zarathustra heard this, guess what happened inside him? He felt sorry and suddenly fell down hard, like a strong oak tree finally cut down. Even the people trying to cut him down were shocked. But he got up quickly and looked serious.

“I know you,” he said loudly. “You are the one who killed God! Let me go.

You couldn’t stand the one who saw the real you—who looked right through you, ugly as you are. So you took revenge on that witness!” Zarathustra said this and tried to leave, but the strange man grabbed his clothes and started making noises, trying to speak again. “Wait,” he said at last, “Wait! Don’t walk away! I figured out what hit you like an axe: bravo, Zarathustra, for getting back up!

I know how the man who killed God feels. Stay! Sit here with me; this isn’t for nothing.

Who else would I go to but you? Stay, sit down! But don’t look at me! Show some respect for my ugliness!

They chase me everywhere. Now you’re my last hope. Not with their hate or their officers—oh, I could laugh at that and still be proud!

Hasn’t success always come to those who get persecuted? And those who persecute learn to be humble when they’re defeated! But it’s their pity I run from, and I run to you. Oh Zarathustra, protect me, you’re my last hope, the only one who understands me—you know how the man who killed God feels. Stay! And if you leave, don’t go the same way I came. That way is bad.

Are you mad at me for talking too much already?
