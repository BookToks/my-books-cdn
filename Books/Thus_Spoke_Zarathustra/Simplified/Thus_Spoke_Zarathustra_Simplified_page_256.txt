His dad and both grandpas were Lutheran ministers.

When he was 2, his sister Elisabeth was born.

At 4 years old, his dad died when he was only 35.

The family then moved to a nearby town called Naumburg.

At 14, Nietzsche started going to the famous Pforta High School.

When he was 20, in October, he began studying theology at the University of Bonn. But by his second semester, he switched to philology, which means studying languages and old texts. Around Easter, he refused to take communion, which made his mom upset.

At 21, in October, Nietzsche moved to the University of Leipzig to study classical philology. He also tried to study music because he liked playing piano and composing.

By chance, he found the philosophy of Schopenhauer in a bookstore.

In January, a well-known professor named A. Ritschl noticed Nietzsche and praised him as a future great philologist. Nietzsche said, "One day, I was suddenly a philologist."

When he was 23, Nietzsche joined an artillery regiment but had to leave because he got hurt while riding a horse.

During his time in Leipzig, Nietzsche doubted if philology was really what he wanted. He saw it more as a way to explore interesting philosophical ideas.

From 1869 to 1879, when he was 24, Nietzsche became a professor.

In November, he met Richard Wagner, the famous composer, for the first time.
