"Give us this last man, O Zarathustra," they shouted. "Make us into these last men! Then we will give you the overman!" Everyone laughed and clicked their tongues.

But Zarathustra felt sad and thought, "They don’t get me. I’m not the right person to talk to them.

Maybe I’ve lived too long in the mountains, listening to the streams and trees. Now I talk to them like they’re simple goatherds.

My soul is calm and clear, like the mountains in the morning. But they think I’m cold and making fun with scary jokes.

Now they look at me and laugh, but they hate me too. Their laughter feels icy."

Then something happened that made everyone stop talking and stare. The tight-rope walker started his show. He came out of a small door and walked on a rope stretched between two towers above the marketplace and people.

When he reached the middle, the little door opened again. A man dressed like a clown jumped out and ran after the tight-rope walker. "Keep going, lamefoot!" he shouted loudly. "Lazybones, intruder, pale face! I’ll kick you if you don’t move! You belong in the tower, locked up. You’re blocking someone better than you!"

The clown got closer and closer. Then something scary happened. He screamed like a devil and jumped over the tight-rope walker.

The tight-rope walker got scared, lost his balance, dropped his pole, and fell fast down, arms and legs flailing.

The marketplace was like a stormy sea as people moved apart, especially where the body would hit the ground.

Zarathustra stayed standing. Right next to him, the man’s body fell, badly hurt and twisted, but still alive.
