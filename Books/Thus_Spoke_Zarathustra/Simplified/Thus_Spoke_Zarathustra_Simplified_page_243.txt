it was a pious, strange litany in praise of the adored and censed ass. And the litany sounded thus: Amen! And glory and honour and wisdom and thanks and praise and strength be to our God, from everlasting to everlasting!
 
 -The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.
 
 He carried our burdens, he has taken upon him the form of a servant, he is patient of heart and never says No; and he who loves his God chastises him.
 
 -The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.
 
 He speaks not: except that he ever says yes to the world which he created: thus does he extol his world. It is his artfulness that speaks not: thus is he rarely found wrong.
 
 -The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.
 
 Uncomely goes he through the world. Grey is the favourite colour in which he wraps his virtue. has he spirit, then does he conceal it; every one, however, believes in his long ears.
 
 -The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.
 
 What hidden wisdom it is to wear long ears, and only to say yes and never No! has he not created the world in his own image, namely, as stupid as possible?
 
 -The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.
 
 You go straight and crooked ways; it concerns you little what seems straight or crooked to us men. Beyond good and evil is your domain. It is your innocence not to know what innocence is.
 
 -The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.
 
 Behold. how you spurn none from you, neither beggars nor kings. you suffer little children to come to you, and when the bad boys decoy you, then say you simply, YE-A.
 
 -The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.
 
 You love she-asses and fresh figs, you are no food-despiser. A thistle tickles your heart when you chance to be hungry. There is the wisdom of a God therein.
 
 -The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.
