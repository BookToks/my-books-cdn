It was a weird but respectful chant praising the beloved donkey. The chant went like this: Amen! And glory, honor, wisdom, thanks, praise, and strength be to our God, forever and ever!

- But the donkey here brayed YE-A.

He carries our loads, takes the role of a servant, is patient, and never says No; and the one who loves God corrects him.

- But the donkey here brayed YE-A.

He doesn’t speak, except to always say yes to the world he made: that’s how he shows love for his world. His cleverness is quiet, so he is rarely wrong.

- But the donkey here brayed YE-A.

He looks plain as he moves through the world. Grey is the favorite color he wears to hide his goodness. If he has spirit, he keeps it hidden; but everyone believes in his long ears.

- But the donkey here brayed YE-A.

It’s smart to have long ears, to only say yes and never No! Didn’t he make the world in his own image, as silly as possible?

- But the donkey here brayed YE-A.

You go straight and crooked paths; it doesn’t matter to you what seems right or wrong to us. Your world is beyond good and evil. It’s innocent not to even know what innocence is.

- But the donkey here brayed YE-A.

Look how you don’t turn anyone away, not beggars or kings. You let little kids come to you, and when bad boys trick you, you just say YE-A.

- But the donkey here brayed YE-A.

You love female donkeys and fresh figs; you don’t refuse any food. A thistle makes your heart happy when you’re hungry. There is the wisdom of a God in that.

- But the donkey here brayed YE-A.
