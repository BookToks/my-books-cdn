And if you want to be free, my friends, you need to be saved by someone even greater than any hero you know!

I have never seen a perfect person. I have seen both the greatest and the smallest people, and they are still pretty much the same. Even the greatest people I found are just human! This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 2, (5) TO THE GOOD ONES

Sometimes, you have to shout loudly with thunder and fireworks to wake up lazy and sleepy minds.

But beauty speaks softly; it only reaches those who are truly awake.

Today, my shield laughed gently at me; it was the holy, happy laugh of beauty.

Today, beauty laughed at you, good people. And this is what it said to me: "You want to be rewarded on top of being good! You want heaven for your good deeds and forever for today?"

And now you are angry at me for saying there is no one who rewards or punishes? I don’t even say that being good is its own reward.

This is what makes me sad: the ideas of reward and punishment have become part of everything—even inside your hearts, good people!

But my words will dig deep into your souls like a wild boar rooting in the dirt; you will call me a plow.

All your secrets will come out; when you lie broken in the sun, your lies will be separated from your truth.

This is your truth: you are too pure for words like revenge, punishment, payback, or punishment.

You love your goodness like a mother loves her child; but when have you ever heard of a mother wanting to be paid for her love?
