And by still greater ones than any of the saviors must you be saved, my brothers, if you would find the way to freedom!
 
 Never yet has there been a overman. Naked have I seen both of them, the greatest man and the smallest man:All-too-similar are they still to each other. Truly, even the greatest found I - all-too-human! Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 2, (5) THE VIRTUOUS WITH thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to indolent and somnolent senses.
 
 But beauty's voice speaks gently: it appeals only to the most awakened souls.
 
 Gently vibrated and laughed to me to-day my buckler; it was beauty's holy laughing and thrilling.
 
 At you, you virtuous ones, laughed my beauty to-day. And thus came its voice to me: "They want - to be paid besides!" You want to be paid besides, you virtuous ones! you want reward for virtue, and heaven for earth, and eternity for your to-day?
 
 And now you upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward-giver, nor paymaster? And truly, I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward.
 
 Ah! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward and punishment been insinuated - and now even into the basis of your souls, you virtuous ones!
 
 But like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the basis of your souls; a ploughshare will I be called by you.
 
 All the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and when you lie in the sun, grubbed up and broken, then will also your falsehood be separated from your truth.
 
 For this is your truth: you are too pure for the filth of the words: vengeance, punishment, recompense, retribution.
 
 76 You love your virtue as a mother loves her child; but when did one hear of a mother wanting to be paid for her love?
