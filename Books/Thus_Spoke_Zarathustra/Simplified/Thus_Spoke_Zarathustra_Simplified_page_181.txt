I’ve never found a girl I want to have kids with, except maybe this one I love: I love you, Eternity!

I love you, Eternity!

If I’ve ever tasted the perfect mix of everything—spicy and sweet, near and far, fire and spirit, joy and sadness, harsh and kind—if I’m part of the special salt that makes everything blend just right: There’s a salt that brings good and bad together, and even the worst things have value, like a final touch of flavor.  
Oh, how could I not be passionate about Eternity, and the greatest promise—the ring that means coming back again?

I’ve never found a girl I want to have kids with, except maybe this one I love: I love you, Eternity!

I love you, Eternity!

If I love the sea and everything about it, especially when it’s wild and fights back: If I have the excitement that makes sailors explore unknown places, if my joy is like theirs: If I’ve ever shouted, "The shore is gone, the last chain is broken! The endless ocean surrounds me, space and time shine far away—hey, cheer up, heart!"  
Oh, how could I not be passionate about Eternity, and the greatest promise—the ring that means coming back again?

I’ve never found a girl I want to have kids with, except maybe this one I love: I love you, Eternity!

I love you, Eternity!

If my goodness is like a dancer’s, jumping happily into joy: If my bad side is like laughing, playing among roses and lilies—if all evil is really just laughter, made pure by its own happiness:  
And if my beginning and end is that heavy things become light, everyone becomes a dancer, and every spirit a bird—that’s really my whole meaning!
