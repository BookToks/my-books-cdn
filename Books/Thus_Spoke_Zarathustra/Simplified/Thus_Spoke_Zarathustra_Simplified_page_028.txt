But I don’t stand for much longer: I’m already lying down. When Zarathustra heard the wise man speak like this, he laughed quietly inside because a new idea came to him. He thought to himself: This wise man might seem silly with his many thoughts, but I think he knows how to sleep well.

It’s even lucky for someone to live near this wise man! His peaceful sleep can spread to others—even through thick walls, it spreads.

There’s even something special about his professor’s chair. And it wasn’t for nothing that young people sat in front of this teacher of goodness.

His smart idea is to stay awake so you can sleep well later. And honestly, if life didn’t make sense and I had to pick something meaningless, this would be the best kind of nonsense for me too.

Now I understand what people really wanted when they looked for teachers of goodness long ago. They wanted good sleep for themselves and calming ideas to help it!

All those famous wise people in schools saw wisdom as sleep without dreams: they didn’t know anything deeper about life.

Even now, there are still some like this teacher of goodness, though not always so honest. But their time is ending. Soon they won’t stand anymore: they’re already lying down.

Lucky are those sleepy people: because they will soon fall asleep for good. This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (3) ON BELIEVERS IN AN AFTERWORLD

Once, Zarathustra also thought beyond humans, like all people who believe in life after death. Back then, the world seemed like the work of a suffering and hurt god.

The world seemed like a dream or a made-up story of a god; like colorful smoke in front of the eyes of an unhappy god.

Good and bad, joy and pain, me and you—all seemed like colorful smoke before the eyes of the creator. The creator wanted to look away from himself, so he made the world.

For someone who suffers, it’s a kind of happy drunkenness to look away from their pain and forget themselves.
