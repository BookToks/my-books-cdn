The main idea of this work, called the Eternal Recurrence, is the highest way to say "yes" to life. I first thought of it in August 1881. I wrote it down on a piece of paper and added, "Six thousand feet beyond man and time." 

Was it inspiration? I will explain. If someone still believed in a little bit of magic or superstition, it would be hard to ignore the feeling that they are just a voice or tool for a powerful force. The idea of revelation means that something shocking and life-changing suddenly becomes clear and certain. You hear it without looking for it, and you accept it without asking where it comes from. A thought flashes like lightning, coming suddenly and with no choice.

The psychological problem with Zarathustra’s type is this: how can someone who says no to everything accepted so far still be a spirit that says yes? How can he, who carries a heavy fate and difficult life, be the brightest and most spiritual person — because Zarathustra is like a dancer? How can he, who understands the hardest and darkest realities and thinks deep, scary thoughts, not see these as reasons to reject life or the idea of eternal recurrence? Instead, he finds reasons to fully accept everything, saying a big and unlimited "Yes" and "Amen."

The book "Beyond Good and Evil," written when I was 42 in 1886, criticizes modern times. It talks about modern science, art, and politics, and also points to a type of person who is very different from modern people — a noble type who says yes to life. In this way, the book is like a school for gentlemen, but here "gentleman" means much more spiritual and deep than usual.
