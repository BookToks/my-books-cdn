Have you ever ridden a horse? Now you’re riding fast toward your goal. But remember, your hurt foot is still with you, even on horseback!

When you get to your goal and get off your horse — exactly at your highest point — you might trip and fall!

You creators, you important people! You only carry your own ideas inside you.

Don’t let anyone boss you around! Who is really your neighbor? Even if you do something “for your neighbor,” you’re still not making it for them.

Please stop thinking “for” others, creators: your true power doesn’t care about “for,” “because of,” or “on account of.” Ignore those little fake words.

Doing things “for your neighbor” is only for small-minded people: it’s like “you help me, I help you.” They don’t have your right or strength to focus on yourself!

In your self-focus, creators, you plan ahead like a pregnant woman! What no one has seen yet, the future fruit, is what protects and feeds your whole love.

Where all your love is — with your creation — there is your true strength! Your work and your will are your “neighbor”: don’t let fake values trick you!

You creators, important people! Anyone who has to give birth is in pain; anyone who has given birth is not pure.

Ask women: giving birth isn’t fun. The pain makes hens and poets noisy.

You creators, you have a lot of impurity because you had to be like mothers.

A new child means new mess in the world! Step back! Anyone who’s given birth must clean their soul!

Don’t try to be better than you can be! Don’t expect things from yourself that don’t make sense!

Follow the path your parents’ strengths have already walked!

How can you rise if your parents’ will doesn’t rise with you?

But if you want to be first, be careful not to end up last! And where your parents had faults, don’t pretend to be perfect!
