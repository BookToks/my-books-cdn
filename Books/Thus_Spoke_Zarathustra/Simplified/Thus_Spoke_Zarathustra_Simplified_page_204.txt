But who could take your sadness away? I’m too weak for that. We’d have to wait a long time for someone to bring your old God back to life.

That old God is gone forever; he’s really dead.” That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 4, (7) THE UGLIEST MAN – Zarathustra ran again through mountains and forests, looking everywhere for the person he wanted to see—the one who was suffering and crying out. But he couldn’t find him anywhere. Still, Zarathustra felt happy inside and thankful.

“What good things this day has given me to make up for its bad start! What strange people I’ve met!

I’ll think about their words slowly, like chewing good corn; I’ll chew carefully until their meaning flows like milk into my soul!”

Then the path bent around a rock, and suddenly the whole place changed. Zarathustra entered a land of death. Black and red cliffs rose high, with no grass, trees, or birds singing.

It was a valley that all animals avoided, even predators, except for a kind of ugly, thick, green snake that came here to die when it got old. The shepherds called it “Serpentdeath.” Zarathustra felt lost in dark memories because it seemed like he had been there before. He felt heavy inside, walked slower and slower, and finally stopped.

When he opened his eyes, he saw someone sitting by the side of the path who looked almost like a man but also not like one—a strange, hard-to-describe figure. Suddenly, Zarathustra felt very ashamed for looking at this thing. His face turned red all the way to his white hair. He looked away and lifted his foot to leave this cursed place.

But then the dead, quiet land came alive with sound. From the ground, a noise bubbled up, gurgling and rattling like water flowing through blocked pipes at night. Finally, it turned into a human voice saying: “Zarathustra!”
