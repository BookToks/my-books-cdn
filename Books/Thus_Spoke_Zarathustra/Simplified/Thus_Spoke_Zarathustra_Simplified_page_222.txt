"Why does he want to get rid of beggars?" 

"Cheer up," Zarathustra replied, "like I do. Follow your own ways, you great person: grind your corn, drink your water, enjoy your cooking—if it makes you happy!  

I only make rules for my own kind; I’m not meant for everyone. But those who belong to me must be strong and quick—happy to fight and celebrate, not grumpy or dreamy. They must be ready for hard work as well as fun, healthy and strong.  

The best things belong to me and my people; if we don’t get them, we take them—the best food, the clearest sky, the strongest ideas, the most beautiful women!"  

Zarathustra said this, and the king on the right answered, "That’s strange! Have you ever heard such smart words from a wise man?  

It’s really odd when a wise man is also sensible and not foolish." The king said this and was surprised; the donkey, however, said “Yeah” with a bad attitude. This was the start of a long meal called "The Supper" in the history books.  

During this meal, they only talked about the higher man.  

Part 4, (13) THE HIGHER MAN 1.  

When I first came to people, I made a big mistake: I showed up in the town square.  

I talked to everyone but really talked to no one. At night, my friends were tightrope walkers and dead bodies; I almost felt like a corpse myself.  

But the next morning, I found a new truth: I learned to say, "What does the town square, the crowd, and their noise matter to me?"  

You higher men, learn this from me: No one in the town square believes in higher men. But if you want to talk there, go ahead! The crowd just blinks and says, "We are all equal."  

"You higher men," the crowd blinks, "there are no higher men, we’re all equal; man is man before God—we’re all equal!" Before God!
