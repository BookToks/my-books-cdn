Right now, I’m sailing on uncertain seas; luck teases me with sweet words. I look forward and backward but still see no end.

The time for my final fight hasn’t come yet—or maybe it’s coming now? The sea and life look at me with tricky beauty all around. Oh, the afternoon of my life! Oh, happiness before the evening! A safe place in the wild ocean! Peace in the unknown! But I don’t trust any of it.

I really don’t trust your sneaky beauty! I’m like a lover who doesn’t trust a smile that’s too smooth.

Just like a jealous lover who pushes away the one he loves—even when being tough is gentle—I push this happy moment away.

Go away, happy moment! You’ve brought me a happiness I didn’t want. I’m ready for my hardest pain—but you came at the wrong time!

Go away, happy moment! Go be with my kids! Hurry and bless them with my happiness before evening!

Look, evening is coming; the sun is setting. Go away, happiness! Zarathustra said this and waited all night for bad luck, but it never came. The night stayed calm and clear, and happiness got closer to him. Near morning, Zarathustra laughed to himself and said, “Happiness is chasing me because I don’t chase after women.

Happiness, after all, is a woman.”

Oh heaven above me, pure and deep! You are a glowing mystery!

Looking at you, I shake with holy desire.

To throw myself up to your height—that’s how deep I feel! To hide in your purity—that’s how innocent I am!

God hides his beauty; that’s why you hide your stars. You don’t speak, but you show your wisdom to me.

Silent above the wild sea, you rose for me today; your love and modesty reveal themselves to my wild soul.
