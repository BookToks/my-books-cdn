Try to be better than even your neighbor. If there’s a right you can grab for yourself, don’t let it slip away!

What you do to others can’t be done back to you the same way. There’s no perfect payback.

If you can’t control yourself, you’ll end up controlled by others. Many people can control themselves, but still don’t really listen to their own rules!

Noble people don’t want things just given to them, especially not life itself.

Regular folks want to live for free, but those of us who’ve been given life always think about what we can give back.

It’s a good saying: “We keep the promises life makes to us.” You shouldn’t want to enjoy something if you don’t help make it enjoyable. And honestly, you shouldn’t just want to enjoy life!

Enjoyment and innocence are shy—they don’t like being chased. You should have them, but it’s better to look for guilt and pain!

My friends, the firstborn are always the ones sacrificed. And now, we are the firstborn!

We all hurt in secret ways, burning ourselves to honor old idols.

Our best is still new and fresh, and that excites the old tastes. Our skin is soft like lamb’s skin—how could we not stir up those ancient priests?

Inside us still lives that old priest who burns our best for his feast. Oh, my friends, how could firstborn ever avoid being sacrificed?

But that’s what our kind wants; I love those who don’t try to save themselves. I love those who are willing to fall, because they go beyond.

Being completely honest—that’s something only a few can do! And those who can, usually won’t. Especially the “good” people can’t be truly honest.

Oh, those good people! They never speak the full truth. Being “good” in spirit is like being sick.

They give in, they obey; their hearts repeat what others say, their souls follow orders. But if you obey, you don’t really listen to yourself!

All the things the “good” call evil must come together for one true thing to be born.
