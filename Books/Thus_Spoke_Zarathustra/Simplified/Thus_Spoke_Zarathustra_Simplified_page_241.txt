Now I stand here as a European, and I can’t be different. I hope God helps me!

Amen!

The deserts are growing: woe to anyone who tries to hide from them!

Part 4, (17) THE AWAKENING 1.

After the wanderer and shadow finished singing, the cave suddenly filled with noise and laughter. Everyone started talking at once, and even the donkey joined in, making noise too. Zarathustra felt a bit annoyed with his visitors, but he was happy they were having fun. It seemed like they were getting better.

So he went outside and talked to his animals.

“Where did their sadness go now?” he asked. He already felt less annoyed. “It looks like they’ve forgotten how to cry out in pain!

But, oh no, not their crying.” Zarathustra covered his ears because the donkey’s loud “YE-A” mixed strangely with the happy shouts of the others.

“They’re happy,” he said again, “and maybe they’re even laughing at me. If they learned to laugh from me, it’s still not my kind of laughter.

But that doesn’t matter! They’re old people: they get better their own way and laugh in their own way. My ears have heard worse and don’t get upset.

Today is a victory: the spirit of gravity, my old enemy, is already giving up and flying away! How great it is that this day, which started so badly and sadly, is ending so well!

And it’s almost evening. The good rider comes over the sea! How it bounces, the blessed one, the one coming home, in its purple saddle!

The sky shines brightly above, the world is quiet. Oh, all you strange ones who came to me, it’s already worth living with me!
