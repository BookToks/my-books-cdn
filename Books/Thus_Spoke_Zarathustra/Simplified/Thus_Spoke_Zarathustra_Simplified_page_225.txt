I don’t want to run things for others: they should learn to work for me. My wisdom has built up like a dark cloud, quiet but powerful. All wisdom is like that—it will one day flash like lightning. To the people today, I won’t be light or help them see. Instead, my wisdom’s lightning will blind them and put out their eyes!

Don’t try to do more than you can handle. People who try to do too much are fake and dishonest. Especially when they aim for big things! They make others doubt those big things. These tricky people pretend and lie until they even fool themselves. They act like they’re good and do amazing things, but it’s all fake.

So, you special people, be careful! Nothing is more important and rare than honesty. But today, the common crowd doesn’t know what’s big or small, right or honest. They are naturally crooked and always lie.

You higher people, be careful and don’t trust easily! Keep your reasons to yourself because that’s how the crowd acts today. Once the crowd believes something without reasons, no one can change their mind with reasons. In the marketplace, people use gestures to convince others. But reasons only make the crowd suspicious.

When truth wins there, ask yourself, “What big mistake fought for it?” Also, watch out for the smart people! They hate you because they don’t create anything. Their eyes are cold and empty, like birds with no feathers. These people brag about never lying, but not lying doesn’t mean they love the truth. Be careful!

Just being calm doesn’t mean you understand things! I don’t trust cold, emotionless people. If someone can’t lie, they don’t really know what truth is.

If you want to rise high, use your own legs! Don’t get carried by others or climb on their backs and heads!
