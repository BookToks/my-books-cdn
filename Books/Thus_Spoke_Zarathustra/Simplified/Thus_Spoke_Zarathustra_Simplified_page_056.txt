With your love, go into your alone time, my brother, and with your creating; and only later will justice catch up with you.

With my tears, go into your alone time, my brother. I love anyone who tries to make something bigger than themselves, even if they fail. This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (18) OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN  
Why are you sneaking around so quietly at sunset, Zarathustra? And why are you hiding something under your cloak?

Is it a gift you got? Or a baby you just had? Or are you doing something sneaky, you friend of bad stuff?  
Truly, my brother, said Zarathustra, it is a gift I have been given: it is a small truth I carry.

But it is wild, like a little kid; and if I don’t cover its mouth, it yells too loud.

As I walked alone today, when the sun was going down, an old woman met me and said to my soul: "Zarathustra has talked a lot to us women, but never about women."  
I answered her: "You should only talk about women with men."  
"Talk to me about women too," she said; "I am old enough to forget it soon."  
So I talked to the old woman and said: Everything about women is a mystery, but there is one answer - it is pregnancy.

Man is a tool for woman: the goal is always the child. But what is woman for man?

A real man wants two things: danger and fun. That’s why he wants a woman, as the most dangerous toy.

Men should be trained for war, and women for the rest and fun of the warrior: everything else is silly.

Warriors don’t like things that are too sweet. That’s why they like women; even the sweetest woman is a little bitter.

Women understand kids better than men do, but men are more childish than women.
