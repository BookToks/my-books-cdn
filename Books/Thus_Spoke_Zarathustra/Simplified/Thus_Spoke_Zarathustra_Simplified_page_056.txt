With your love, go into your isolation, my brother, and with your creating; and late only will justice limp after you.
 
 With my tears, go into your isolation, my brother. I love him who seeks to create beyond himself, and thus succumbs. Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (18) OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN Why steal you along so furtively in the twilight, Zarathustra? And what hide you so carefully under your mantle?
 
 Is it a treasure that has been given you? Or a child that has been born you? Or go you yourself on a thief's errand, you friend of the evil?Truly, my brother, said Zarathustra, it is a treasure that has been given me: it is a little truth which I carry.
 
 But it is naughty, like a young child; and if I hold not its mouth, it screams too loudly.
 
 As I went on my way alone today, at the hour when the sun declines, there met me an old woman, and she spoke thus to my soul: "Much has Zarathustra spoken also to us women, but never spoke he to us concerning woman." And I answered her: "Concerning woman, one should only talk to men." "Talk also to me of woman," said she; "I am old enough to forget it presently." And I obliged the old woman and spoke thus to her: Everything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman has one solution - it is called pregnancy.
 
 Man is for woman a means: the purpose is always the child. But what is woman for man?
 
 Two different things wants the true man: danger and diversion. Therefore wants he woman, as the most dangerous plaything.
 
 Man shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation of the warrior: all else is folly.
 
 Too sweet fruits - these the warrior likes not. Therefore likes he woman; - bitter is even the sweetest woman.
 
 Better than man does woman understand children, but man is more 56 childish than woman.
