I want to make things right to my kids because of the mistakes my fathers made, and to everyone in the future for what’s happening now! That’s what Zarathustra said.

Last night, when the moon came up, I thought it looked like it was carrying a sun because it was so big and full on the horizon.

But it was lying about being pregnant; I’d sooner believe in the man in the moon than the woman.

Actually, the man in the moon isn’t much better. He’s a shy night-wanderer who walks quietly on rooftops, feeling guilty.

He’s jealous and wants things, like a monk, jealous of the earth and all the happiness lovers have.

No, I don’t like him, that sneaky cat on the roofs! I hate anyone who sneaks around half-open windows!

He moves quietly and carefully on the stars, but I don’t like people who tiptoe without making noise.

A person who’s honest makes a clear sound when they walk; the cat sneaks around silently. Look, the moon moves like a cat, sneaky and dishonest.

I’m telling you this story to all you fake emotional people, the “pure judges!” I see right through you, you jealous ones!

You love the earth and everything on it, but you’re ashamed of that love—you feel guilty—you’re like the moon!

Your mind tells you to look down on earthly things, but your feelings really want them—and feelings are the strongest part of you!

Now your mind is embarrassed that it serves your feelings, so it tries to hide and lie to avoid feeling shame.

Your lying mind says to itself, “The best thing would be to look at life without wanting anything, not like a dog with its tongue out.

To be happy just watching, with no desires or selfish needs—cold and gray, but with excited eyes like the moon!

That would be the best thing,” your tricked mind tells itself. “To love the earth like the moon does, just by looking at its beauty.

And that’s what I call perfect seeing: wanting nothing else from things, just being able to lie in front of them like a mirror with many sides.
