Greed, jealousy, angry revenge, and people’s pride—all of these caught my attention. It’s not true anymore that poor people are lucky. Instead, the kingdom of heaven is with the cows.

“Why isn’t it with the rich?” asked Zarathustra, teasing as he held back the cows that were sniffing the peaceful man.

“Why do you tease me?” the man answered. “You know better than I do. What made me go to the poorest, Zarathustra? Wasn’t it because I was disgusted by the richest?

The rich are the ones who get their money in bad ways, with cold eyes and dirty thoughts. They make money from all kinds of trash. They are a stinky crowd, fake and full of lies. Their families used to steal or pick through garbage. Their wives are careless and forgetful—almost like bad people. Rich people above, poor people below! What do ‘poor’ and ‘rich’ even mean now?

I stopped thinking like that, and I ran farther and farther away until I reached the cows.” The peaceful man said this while breathing hard and sweating, making the cows curious again. Zarathustra smiled and looked at him quietly as he spoke so seriously, then shook his head.

“You are being too hard on yourself, Preacher-on-the-Mount, when you use such harsh words. You don’t have the mouth or eyes for that kind of anger.

Also, I don’t think your stomach can handle all that rage and hatred. Your stomach wants softer things—you’re not a butcher.

You seem more like someone who eats plants and roots. Maybe you grind grain. You don’t like the pleasures of meat, and you love honey.”

“You guessed me right,” the man said happily. “I love honey, and I grind grain. I look for things that taste sweet and freshen the breath. I like things that take a long time and effort, good for calm, lazy people.

The cows have gone the furthest—they chew their food slowly and lie in the sun. They avoid heavy thoughts that make the heart feel big.”

“Well!” said Zarathustra, “you should also meet my animals, my eagle and my snake—there’s nothing like them on earth right now.”
