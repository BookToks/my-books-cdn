Now come here! And jump quickly and sneakily! Now up! And over!

- Oh no. I fell because I swung too far!

Look at me lying here, you proud one, begging for kindness! I would love to walk with you - somewhere more beautiful!

- On love’s paths, through colorful bushes, quiet and neat! Or by the lake, where goldfish swim and dance!

Are you tired now? Up there are sheep and sunset stripes: isn’t it nice to sleep while the shepherd plays his pipe?

Are you really tired? I’ll carry you there; just let your arm rest! And are you thirsty? I might have something to drink; but your mouth wouldn’t want it! Oh, that tricky, fast, sneaky snake and hidden witch! Where did you go? But I feel two red itchy spots on my face from your hand!

I’m really tired of always being your sheepish shepherd. Witch, if I have sung to you so far, now you will cry to me!

To the beat of my whip, you will dance and cry! I haven’t forgotten my whip? - No, I haven’t!

Then Life answered me and kept her ears closed: “O Zarathustra! Don’t crack your whip so loudly! You know that noise kills thought - and just now I had some delicate thoughts.

We are both genuine troublemakers. Beyond good and evil, we found our island and green meadow - just the two of us! So we have to be kind to each other!

And even if we don’t love each other deeply, should we hold a grudge if our love isn’t perfect?

And you know I am friendly to you, maybe too friendly; that’s because I’m jealous of your Wisdom. Ah, this crazy old fool, Wisdom!

If your Wisdom ever leaves you, then my love will run away from you fast too.” Life looked around carefully and said softly: “O Zarathustra, you are not loyal enough to me!

You don’t love me as much as you say; I know you are thinking of leaving me soon.

There is an old heavy clock that booms at night near your cave: when you hear it strike midnight, I know you think between one and twelve about leaving me soon!”
