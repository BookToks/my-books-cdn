His face is still dark; the shadow of his hand moves over it.

His eyes are still covered by a shadow.

His actions still cover him like a shadow: what he has done hides who he really is. He hasn't moved past what he's done yet.

I do admire his strong shoulders like an ox’s, but now I want to see the clear eye of an angel too.

He still needs to forget his proud, heroic will: one day he should be more than just great—he should be truly lifted up, even without trying.

He has beaten monsters and solved puzzles. But he should also turn those monsters and puzzles into something good, like heavenly children.

His knowledge hasn’t learned to smile or be without jealousy yet; his strong feelings haven’t calmed down into something beautiful.

His longing won’t end when he’s full, but when he finds true beauty! Being graceful is part of the generosity of the great.

The hero should rest with his arm over his head; this is how he should relax—and how he should rise above rest too.

But for heroes, beauty is the hardest thing to reach. No passionate will can fully get it.

A little more or a little less—that difference is everything here.

Standing with relaxed muscles and a free will—that’s the hardest thing for you great ones.

When power becomes gentle and shows itself openly, I call that beauty.

And I want beauty most from you, the powerful one: let your kindness be your greatest victory.

I blame all the bad things on you, so I want you to choose the good.

I’ve often laughed at weak people who think they’re good just because they can’t hurt anyone.

You should aim to be like a strong pillar: the higher it rises, the more beautiful, graceful, and strong it becomes inside.

Yes, one day, great one, you will be beautiful too and see your own beauty clearly.

Then your soul will feel divine desires, and even your pride will have respect.

This is the secret of the soul: when the hero leaves it behind, only the super-hero reaches it in dreams.
