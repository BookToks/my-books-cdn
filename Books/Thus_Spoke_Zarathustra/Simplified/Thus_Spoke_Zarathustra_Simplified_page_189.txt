You don’t believe this? You shake your head? Well! Cheer up, old bear! But I’m also someone who can see the future.” That’s what Zarathustra said.

Before Zarathustra had been walking for an hour in the mountains and forests, he suddenly saw a strange group. Right on the path he was about to go down, two kings were walking, wearing crowns and purple belts, looking bright and colorful like flamingos. They were leading a donkey carrying a load. “What are these kings doing in my area?” Zarathustra wondered and quickly hid behind some bushes. When the kings got closer, he said quietly, like talking to himself, “Weird! Weird! How does this make sense? I see two kings – but only one donkey!”

The two kings stopped and smiled, looking toward where the voice came from, then at each other. “We think about that too,” said the king on the right, “but we don’t say it out loud.” The king on the left shrugged and said, “Maybe it’s a goat herder. Or a hermit who’s lived too long with rocks and trees. Because no group really ruins good manners.”

“Good manners?” the other king said angrily. “Then why do we avoid others? Isn’t it because of ‘good manners’? Our ‘good society’?”

“It’s better to live with hermits and goat herders than with our fake, showy people – even if they call themselves ‘good society.’ Even if they call themselves ‘nobles.’ But everything there is fake and dirty, especially the blood – because of old bad sicknesses and worse doctors.”

“Right now, the best and most important to me is still a strong peasant, rough, clever, stubborn, and tough: that’s the noblest kind.”

“The peasant is the best right now; and peasants should be in charge! But this is the kingdom of the common people – I won’t let anyone boss me around anymore. The common people are just a messy mix.”

“A messy mix of people: everything all mixed up, saints and cheaters, gentlemen and Jews, and every kind of animal from Noah’s ark.”
