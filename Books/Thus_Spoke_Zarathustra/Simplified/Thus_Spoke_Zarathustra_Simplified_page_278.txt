Everything we notice, every moment we are aware of, doesn’t just disappear—it happens again and again forever, and we do too. The world cares about you so much that it keeps repeating you forever.

It’s hard to prove for sure that this happens, but that’s true for all ideas and beliefs. The one thing we can almost be sure about, like Descartes said, is "I think, therefore I am." But even thinking is tricky and tries hard to feel real and lasting, like it wants to survive after we die. Still, being aware is the most real thing. Saying "I see the sky, I see the tree, I am thinking, so I exist" might be wrong about some words, but you know for sure you are aware of something. So, "I am aware, therefore I exist." Being aware and existing are the same.

Instead of asking if eternal recurrence is true, maybe we should ask: what good is this idea? Can it help us feel better or healthier? My answer is yes. It’s like a mind game that can help you wake up and enjoy life more, letting go of worries and focusing on what’s right in front of you. Like Fritz Perls said, it’s about "losing your mind and coming to your senses."

Does eternal recurrence mean we need a new kind of right and wrong? Not really.

Some say it means a new “natural” kind of right and wrong, like animals have. But calling it "animal morality" sounds weird because animals don’t think about right and wrong like we do. They just live and die. So it’s better to forget that word.

Without rules, are we free to do whatever we want? No, because there are always results. You can’t walk through walls. You can’t bother people without them getting upset. You can’t threaten someone without them defending themselves. But this isn’t about right or wrong; it’s just common sense.

What eternal recurrence really means is a new kind of health. It helps you wake up from the social “dream” and see the world around you clearly. This world includes your body, which has its own rules like animals do—protecting itself and family, being smart, wanting power, and wanting to laugh.

At its core, morality tries to cheat life out of its ending—death.
