I really learned how to wait, but only for myself. Most of all, I learned how to stand, walk, run, jump, climb, and dance.

Here’s what I want to teach: if you want to fly one day, you first have to learn to stand, walk, run, climb, and dance. You don’t just start flying right away!

I used rope ladders to reach many windows, and with quick legs, I climbed tall masts. Sitting on those high masts felt amazing. Being up there like a small flickering flame was like a little light, but it gave hope to lost sailors.

I found my truth in many different ways. I didn’t just climb one ladder to see far away; I took many paths.

I didn’t like asking for directions, it wasn’t my style. Instead, I questioned and tested the paths themselves.

My whole journey was about testing and questioning. And you also have to learn how to answer those questions! That’s just my style—not good or bad, just mine, and I’m not ashamed of it anymore.

When people asked me about “the way,” I said, “This is my way—what’s yours?” Because the way doesn’t really exist!

This is what Zarathustra said.

Here I sit and wait, surrounded by old broken tables and new half-finished ones. When will my time come?

The time to go down again, to return to people.

I wait for the signs that tell me it’s my time—like a laughing lion with a flock of doves.

While I wait, I talk to myself because I have time. No one tells me anything new, so I tell myself my own story.
