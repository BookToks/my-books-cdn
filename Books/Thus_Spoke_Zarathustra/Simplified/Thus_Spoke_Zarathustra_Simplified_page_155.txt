Truly, I learned waiting also, and thoroughly so, - but only waiting for myself. And above all did I learn standing and walking and running and leaping and climbing and dancing.
 
 This however is my teaching: he who wishes one day to fly, must first learn standing and walking and running and climbing and dancing: one does not fly into flying!
 
 With rope-ladders learned I to reach many a window, with nimble legs did I climb high masts: to sit on high masts of perception seemed to me no small bliss;-To flicker like small flames on high masts: a small light, certainly, but a great comfort to cast-away sailors and ship-wrecked ones!
 
 By divers ways and wendings did I arrive at my truth; not by one ladder did I mount to the height where my eye roves into my remoteness.
 
 And unwillingly only did I ask my way - that was always counter to my taste! Rather did I question and test the ways themselves.
 
 A testing and a questioning has been all my travelling: - and truly, one must also learn to answer such questioning! That, however, - is my taste: -Neither a good nor a bad taste, but my taste, of which I have no longer either shame or secrecy.
 
 "This - is now my way, - where is yours?" Thus did I answer those who asked me "the way." For the way - it does not exist!
 
 Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 3, (12) OLD AND NEW TABLES 1.
 
 HERE do I sit and wait, old broken tables around me and also new half-written tables. When comes my hour?
 
 -The hour of my descent, of my down-going: for once more will I go to men.
 
 For that hour do I now wait: for first must the signs come to me that it is my hour - namely, the laughing lion with the flock of doves.
 
 Meanwhile do I talk to myself as one who has time. No one tells me anything new, so I tell myself my own story.
