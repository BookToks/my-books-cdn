Yes, you creators, you will have to face a lot of hard and painful endings in your life! That’s why you accept and explain why everything dies.

If the creator wants to be like a newborn baby, he must also be ready to be the one who gives birth and go through the pain that comes with it.

Really, I have lived many lives and seen many beginnings. I have said many goodbyes; I know how painful those final moments are.

But this is what my creative will decides, my fate. Or to be honest: this kind of fate is what my will wants.

All feelings suffer inside me and feel trapped, but my will always comes to free me and make me feel better.

Willing to act sets you free: that is the true lesson about will and freedom—this is what Zarathustra teaches you.

I don’t want to stop willing, valuing, or creating! I hope I never become weak like that!

Even when I understand things, I feel the joy of my will creating and growing. If my knowledge feels pure, it’s because it wants to create.

This will took me away from God and gods; if they existed, what would be left to create?

But my strong creative will always pushes me toward people, like a hammer hitting a stone.

Ah, inside the stone, I see a picture of my dreams! But it sleeps inside the hardest, ugliest stone!

Now my hammer hits the stone hard. Pieces fly off, but I don’t care.

I will finish it: a shadow came to me once—the lightest and quietest shadow!

The beauty of the overman came to me as a shadow. Oh, my friends!

Now, what do gods matter to me? This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 2, (3) MY FRIENDS, some people make fun of your friend: "Look at Zarathustra! Doesn’t he act like an animal among us?"  

But it’s better to say: "The wise one walks among people as if they were animals."
