The small man always comes back again and again! I once saw both the greatest man and the smallest man without anything to hide them. They were way too much alike—just very human, even the greatest man!

Even the greatest man is too small! That’s what made me feel annoyed with people!

And the smallest man always coming back again—that’s what made me feel annoyed with everything that exists!

Ah, annoyance! Annoyance! Annoyance! Zarathustra said this, then sighed and shivered because he remembered when he was sick. Then his animals stopped him from talking more.

“Don’t talk anymore, you’re still getting better!” his animals said. “Go outside where the world is like a beautiful garden waiting for you.

Go to the roses, the bees, and the groups of doves! But especially go to the singing birds, and learn how to sing from them!

Singing is for people who are getting better; healthy people can talk. And when healthy people want songs, they want different songs than those who are still healing.” 

“Hey, you silly barrel-organs, be quiet!” Zarathustra answered and smiled at his animals. “You know well the comfort I found for myself in seven days!

I needed to sing again—that’s the comfort I made for myself while healing. Do you want to turn it into another song?” 

“Don’t say more,” his animals said again. “Instead, you who are still healing, first get ready a lyre, a new lyre!

Because, look, Zarathustra, for your new songs you need new lyres.

Sing and get excited, Zarathustra, heal your soul with new songs so you can handle your big fate, which no one has had before!

Your animals know who you are and who you must become: you are the teacher of the eternal return—that is your fate now!

You have to be the first to teach this idea—how could such a big fate not also be your biggest danger and weakness!

We know what you teach: that all things come back again and again, including ourselves, and that we have already lived many, many times before, along with everything else.

You teach that there is a huge cycle of becoming, a miracle of a huge cycle; it must keep turning like an hourglass so it can run down and then start again.

So all those years are like each other, both the biggest and the smallest, and we ourselves, in every big cycle, are like ourselves in all the big and small ways.
