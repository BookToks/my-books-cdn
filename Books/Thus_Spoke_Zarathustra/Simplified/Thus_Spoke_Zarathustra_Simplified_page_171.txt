The wind carries a strong smell that’s looking for you; and all the little streams want to follow you.

Everything misses you because you’ve been alone for seven days. Come out of your cave! Everything wants to help heal you!

Did you learn something new, something sad and hard? Like dough that rises, your soul grew bigger than before.  
 
"My animals," Zarathustra said, "keep talking like this, I want to listen! It makes me feel better to hear you: when there is talking, the world feels like a beautiful garden to me."

It’s so nice that there are words and sounds; aren’t words and sounds like rainbows and bridges connecting things that seem far apart?

Each soul has its own world; every soul sees other souls like a different world.

The most similar people can fool each other the most: even the smallest difference is hard to cross.

For me—how could there be anything outside of me? There is no outside! But we forget this when we hear sounds; it’s so nice to forget!

Aren’t names and sounds made so people can enjoy them? Talking is a fun kind of silliness; with it, people dance over everything.

All speech and even the lies in sounds are lovely! Our love dances on colorful rainbows through sounds.

"O Zarathustra," his animals said, "to those who think like us, everything dances by itself: things come, reach out a hand, laugh, run away—and come back again.

Everything moves, everything comes back; the wheel of life rolls forever. Everything dies, everything grows again; the year of life keeps going forever.

Everything breaks, everything gets put back together; the house of life builds itself again and again. All things separate, all things meet again; the circle of life stays true forever.

Every moment starts life, and around every “Here” there’s a “There.” The center is everywhere. The path of forever is twisted."

"You jokers and music boxes!" Zarathustra answered with a smile, "you know well what had to happen in seven days—how that monster got stuck in my throat and almost choked me! But I bit its head off and spat it out."

"And you—turned that into a song with a lyre?"
