All poets believe this: if you listen carefully while lying in the grass or on quiet hills, you learn about the things between the sky and the earth.

When they feel soft emotions, poets think nature is in love with them. They imagine nature sneaking up to whisper secrets and sweet words in their ears. Poets are proud of this more than anything else!

There are so many things between the sky and earth that only poets have dreamed about!

Especially above the sky: all gods are just symbols or fancy ideas made by poets.

We are always drawn upward, to the clouds. We place our colorful puppets there and call them gods and Supermen. Aren’t they light enough to sit on those clouds? I am tired of all the fake stuff people call real!

I am tired of the poets!

When Zarathustra said this, his student didn’t like it but stayed quiet.

Zarathustra was also quiet, looking inside himself as if staring far away. Finally, he sighed and said, “I belong to today and before, but something inside me is from tomorrow and the future.”

I got tired of all poets, old and new: they all seem shallow to me.

They didn’t think deeply enough; that’s why their feelings don’t go deep.

Their best thoughts are about pleasure and boredom.

Their harp music sounds like ghosts whispering and rustling; they don’t know the power of real strong tones! They’re not pure enough for me; they mix things up to make their work seem deep.

They want to seem peaceful and balanced, but to me, they are just mixers, impure and half-finished! I cast my net into their sea hoping to catch something good, but always pulled up the head of some old god.

So the sea gave a stone to a hungry person. Maybe poets come from the sea itself.
