Who cares about living a long life?

What warrior wants to be kept safe all the time?

I don’t keep you safe because I love you, my brothers in battle! That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (11) THE NEW IDOL There are still some places with tribes and animals, but not here, my brothers: here we have states.

A state? What’s that? Listen carefully, because now I will tell you what I think about the end of peoples.

A state is the coldest, cruelest monster. It lies without feeling. It says, "I am the people." But that’s a lie! Peoples were made by creators who gave them faith and love; that helped life.

But the state is a destroyer. It sets traps for many people and calls that a state. It holds a sword and many desires over them.

Where there are still real peoples, the state is not accepted and is hated like a curse or a crime.

Here’s a sign for you: every people has its own way of deciding what is good and evil. Their neighbors don’t understand it. They made their own laws and customs.

But the state lies about good and evil in every language. Everything it says is a lie, and everything it has was stolen.

Everything in it is fake; with stolen teeth it bites those who bite it. Even its insides are false.

Mixing up what is good and evil—that’s the sign of the state. It really wants death. It calls to those who spread death!

There are way too many people born; the state was made for those extra ones!

Look how it tricks the many extra people! How it swallows them up, chews them, and chews them again!

"Nothing on earth is bigger than me: I am God’s controlling finger," the monster screams. And not only the foolish and blind bow down!

Ah!
