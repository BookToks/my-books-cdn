What matter about long life!
 
 What warrior wishes to be spared!
 
 I spare you not, I love you from my very heart, my brothers in war! Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (11) THE NEW IDOL Somewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, my brothers: here there are states.
 
 A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears to me, for now will I say to you my word concerning the death of peoples.
 
 State is the name of the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lies it also; and this lie creeps from its mouth: "I, the state, am the people." It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung a faith and a love over them: thus they served life.
 
 Destroyers, are they who lay traps for many, and call it the state: they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.
 
 Where there is still a people, there the state is not understood, but hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.
 
 This sign I give to you: every people speaks its language of good and evil: this its neighbor understands not. Its language has it devised for itself in laws and customs.
 
 But the state lies in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it says it lies; and whatever it has it has stolen.
 
 False is everything in it; with stolen teeth it bites, the biting one. False are even its bowels.
 
 Confusion of language of good and evil; this sign I give to you as the sign of the state. Truly, the will to death, indicates this sign! Truly, it beckons to the preachers of death!
 
 Many too many are born: for the superfluous ones was the state devised!
 
 See just how it entices them to it, the many-too-many! How it swallows and chews and rechews them!
 
 "On earth there is nothing greater than I: it is I who am the regulating finger of God." - thus roars the monster. And not only the long-eared and short-sighted fall upon their knees!
 
 43 Ah!
