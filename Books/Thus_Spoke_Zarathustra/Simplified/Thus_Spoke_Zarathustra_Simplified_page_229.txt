Raise your hearts, my friends, higher and higher! And don’t forget your legs! Lift your legs too, good dancers, and even better if you stand on your heads!

There are heavy animals that feel happy, and some that have trouble walking from the start. They try in strange ways, like an elephant trying to stand on its head.

It’s better to be silly and happy than silly and sad. It’s better to dance awkwardly than to walk badly. So please learn from me, you strong people: even the worst things have some good sides— even the worst things have good dancing legs. So please, you strong people, stand on your own good legs!

So stop being sad and sighing all the time! Oh, how sad the silly people seem to me today! But today belongs to those silly people.

Do like the wind when it rushes out of the mountains: it dances to its own tune; the seas shake and jump under its steps.

Praise that wild, good spirit that gives wings to donkeys and milks lionesses. This spirit comes like a storm to everyone and to all the people— it hates slow thinkers and all the weak and tired people. Praise this wild, free spirit of the storm that dances on swamps and troubles just like on fields!

This spirit hates sick, unhappy people and all the gloomy groups— praise this spirit of all free spirits, the laughing storm, which blows dust into the eyes of all the sad and gloomy!

You strong people, your worst problem is that none of you have learned to dance like you should— to dance beyond your limits!

It doesn’t matter that you’ve failed!

There are still so many things you can do! So learn to laugh beyond yourselves! Raise your hearts, you good dancers, high! Higher! And don’t forget to laugh well!

This crown of laughter, this rose crown, I give to you, my brothers! I have made laughing sacred; you strong people, please learn— learn to laugh!
