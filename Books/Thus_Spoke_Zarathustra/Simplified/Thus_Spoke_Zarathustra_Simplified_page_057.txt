Inside every real man, there’s a child who wants to play. So, girls, wake up and find that child in him!

Let woman be like a toy, pure and beautiful like a precious gem, glowing with the good things of a better world.

Let your love shine like a star! Let your hope say, "Maybe I will have a great man!" Be brave in your love! With your love, face the one who scares you!

Let your love be your pride! Women don’t understand pride much, but this should be your pride: always love more than you’re loved, and never be second.

Make men afraid when you love because then you’ll do anything and think everything else is unimportant.

Make men afraid when you hate, because deep down, men are just bad, but women can be mean.

Who do women hate the most? The iron told the magnet: "I hate you most because you pull, but you’re too weak to pull me close." Men’s happiness is "I will." Women’s happiness is "He will." Every woman thinks the world is perfect when she loves and obeys fully.

Women must obey and find something deep inside themselves. A woman’s soul is like a stormy surface on shallow water.

But a man’s soul is deep, with strong currents underground. Women guess its power but don’t truly understand it.

Then an old woman said to me, "Zarathustra said many good things, especially for young people.

It’s strange! Zarathustra doesn’t know much about women, but he’s still right! Maybe it’s because anything is possible with women?

Now, here’s a little truth for you as a thank you! I’m old enough to tell it!

Keep it quiet or it will scream too loud, this little truth." I said, "Give me your little truth, woman!" The old woman said, "You go to women? Don’t forget your whip!" That’s what Zarathustra said.

One day, Zarathustra fell asleep under a fig tree because it was hot, with his arm over his face.
