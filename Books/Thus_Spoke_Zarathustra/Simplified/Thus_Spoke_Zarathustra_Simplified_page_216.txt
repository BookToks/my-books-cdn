Shh! Hasn’t the world just become perfect? Oh, for the golden round ball!

“Get up,” said Zarathustra, “you little thief, you lazy one! What! Still stretching, yawning, sighing, falling into deep wells?

Who are you then, my soul?” (He got scared because a sunbeam shined right on his face.) “Oh heaven above me,” he sighed and sat up, “you’re watching me? You’re listening to my strange soul?

When will you drink this drop of dew that fell on everything on earth—when will you drink this strange soul? When, you endless well of time! You happy and scary midday deep hole! When will you take my soul back into you?” Zarathustra said this and got up from his bed by the tree, like he was waking from a weird dream. And look—the sun was still right above his head. So, he probably hadn’t slept long.

It was late afternoon when Zarathustra, after searching and wandering around uselessly, finally came back to his cave. But when he stood about twenty steps away, something happened he didn’t expect: he heard a big cry of sadness. And strangely, this time the cry came from his own cave. It was a long, mixed, strange cry, and Zarathustra could tell it was made of many voices, though from far away it sounded like just one mouth crying.

Then Zarathustra ran to his cave, and wow, what a sight waited for him after that noise! There sat everyone he had passed during the day: the king on the right and the king on the left, the old magician, the pope, the beggar who chose to be one, the shadow, the thoughtful thinker, the sad fortune-teller, and the donkey. The ugliest man, though, had put a crown on his head and wore two purple belts—because, like all ugly people, he liked to hide and pretend to be handsome. In the middle of this sad group stood Zarathustra’s eagle, all messy and upset because it had been asked too many questions it couldn’t proudly answer; the wise snake hung around its neck.
