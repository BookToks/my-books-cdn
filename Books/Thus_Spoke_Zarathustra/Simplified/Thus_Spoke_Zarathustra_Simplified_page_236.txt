He doesn’t like me— but before night comes, he’ll learn to love and praise me again; he can’t live long without doing silly things like that.

He loves his enemies: he knows how to do that better than anyone I’ve seen. But he takes revenge on his friends for it!” The old magician said this, and the important people clapped for him. So Zarathustra went around, playfully and kindly shaking hands with his friends, like someone who needs to say sorry to everyone.

But when he got to the door of his cave, he suddenly wanted to breathe the fresh air outside and be with his animals, and he wished to sneak out.

Those kings might still act tough in front of us because that’s what they’ve learned best! But if no one was watching, I bet they’d start feeling bad again—the bad feeling of gloomy clouds, damp sadness, hidden skies, lost sunshine, and cold autumn winds—the bad feeling of us crying and asking for help!

Stay with us, Zarathustra! There’s a lot of hidden pain here that wants to be heard, lots of evening shadows, clouds, and damp air!
