How did I stop hating myself?

Who helped me see clearly again? How did I rise up to a place where no bad people hang out near the wells?

Did my hate actually give me wings and the power to find water? I had to go really high to find the well of happiness again!

Oh, I found it, my friends! Up here, at the highest place, the well of happiness is bubbling for me! And nobody bad drinks from it with me!

You flow almost too fast for me, happy fountain! Sometimes you empty my cup just trying to fill it again!

But I need to learn to come to you more calmly: my heart rushes too hard towards you. My heart burns like summer, short, hot, sad, and too happy. How I wish you could cool me down!

The hard times of my past are gone! The cold and ugly things of winter are gone! Now I am fully summer, right in the middle of it!

A summer on the highest peak, with cold fountains and peaceful quiet: come, friends, so the peace can get even better!

This is our place and our home: too high and steep for all the dirty people and their thirst.

Look into my well of happiness with clear eyes, my friends! It won’t get dirty because of you! It will smile back at you with its pure water.

We build our home on the tree of the future; eagles will bring us food!

Food that bad people can’t share with us! If they tried, they’d burn their mouths like eating fire!

We don’t have places for bad people here! Our happiness would feel like an icy cave to their bodies and souls!

We live like strong winds above them, close to the eagles, snow, and sun: that’s how strong winds live.

And one day, I will blow like wind among them, and with my spirit, take the breath from their spirit: that’s what my future will be.

Zarathustra is like a strong wind for all low places; he tells his enemies and all those who hate: "Don’t spit against the wind!" That’s what Zarathustra said.

Look, this is where the tarantulas live!
