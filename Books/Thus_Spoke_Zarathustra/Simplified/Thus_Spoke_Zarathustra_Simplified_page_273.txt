We are not different from animals, but they seem more awake while we spend most of our time lost in our big brains.

The idea of eternal recurrence is a way to help us wake up.

How long until we come back?

A really, really, really long time.

How many years? We need a huge number. A billion is 1,000,000,000, which is a 1 with 9 zeros. A googol is a 1 with 100 zeros after it. A googolplex is a 1 with a googol number of zeros after it. But even that is too small. Mathematicians made the "Graham number," the biggest number ever known, according to the Guinness World Records. It's so big that even writing it out in scientific form would need more digits than there are atoms in the whole universe. Still, this is way too small.

We're not just talking about mixing up cards or grains of sand. We're talking about mixing up every atom in the universe. But eventually, after an unbelievably huge number of years, "the music box plays the same tune again."

That’s a long time to wait. To help with the wait, the universe gives us the "cheerful magic of death."

The Cheerful Magic of Death means that to deal with waiting for that giant number of years, there is actually no waiting. The moment after you die, you "wake up" as the baby you once were.

But when the music box plays the tune again – is it really you?

Is it You who Returns, or just another person exactly like you?
