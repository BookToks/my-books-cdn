People are like animals with red cheeks.

Why is that? Because they have felt ashamed many times.

My friends, listen: shame is a big part of being human!

That’s why a good person tries not to be embarrassed; they try to be shy only around those who are hurting.

I don’t like people who feel happy just because they feel sorry for others; they don’t really understand being shy.

If I have to feel sorry, I don’t want to be called pitiful; and if I do, I’d rather keep it private.

I also like to hide my face and walk away before anyone notices; that’s what I tell you to do too!

I hope I only meet happy people like you, and those I can share good times and sweet moments with.

I have helped people who hurt, but I always felt better when I enjoyed myself more.

Since humans started, we haven’t enjoyed life enough; that’s our biggest mistake!

When we learn to enjoy life more, we stop hurting others and causing pain.

That’s why I thank the hand that helps someone suffering; it also cleans my soul.

Seeing someone suffer made me feel ashamed for their shame; helping them sometimes hurt their pride too.

Big favors don’t make people thankful but angry; small favors, if remembered, can become annoying.

“Be shy when accepting help! Choose carefully when you accept!” – that’s my advice if you have nothing to give.

But I like to give; I give gladly to my friends.

Strangers and poor people can take from me too; it causes less shame that way.

But beggars? We should stop them completely! It’s annoying to give to them, and also annoying not to.

The same goes for sinners and guilty people! Believe me, feeling guilty makes you want to hurt others.

The worst thing is to have small, mean thoughts. Honestly, it’s better to have done something bad than to think small and petty!
