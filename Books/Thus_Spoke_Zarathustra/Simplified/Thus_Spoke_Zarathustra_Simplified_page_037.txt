Brave, bold, proud, and strong – that’s what wisdom wants from us; she is like a woman who only loves a fighter.

You say, “Life is hard.” But why have pride in the morning and give up by the evening?

Life is hard, but don’t act like you’re too fragile! We are all strong animals, like donkeys carrying heavy loads.

What do we have in common with a delicate flower that shakes just because of a drop of dew?

It’s true we love life; not because we’re used to it, but because we’re used to loving.

Love always has a bit of craziness. But there’s always some reason behind that craziness.

To me, the butterflies, bubbles, and other light, silly things seem happiest in life.

Watching these small, fun, lively creatures makes Zarathustra feel both sad and inspired.

I would only believe in a God who knows how to dance.

When I saw my devil, he was serious, deep, and strong: he was the spirit of heaviness – through him, everything falls.

We don’t fight by being angry, but by laughing. Let’s laugh and beat the spirit of heaviness!

I learned to walk; after that, I started to run. I learned to fly; now I don’t need a push to move.

Now I feel light, now I fly; now I see myself from above. Now a God is dancing inside me. This is what Zarathustra said.

One evening, Zarathustra saw that a young guy was avoiding him. While walking alone on the hills near the town called "The Motley Cow," he found the young guy sitting against a tree, looking tired as he stared at the valley.

Zarathustra grabbed the tree next to the young guy and said, "If I tried to shake this tree with my hands, I wouldn't be able to."
