Your body is smarter and wiser than your best thoughts. And no one really knows why your body needs your best thoughts.

Your subconscious self laughs at your "I" and its big ideas. It thinks, "What are these sudden ideas to me? They just get in the way of what I want to do. I guide the ego and prompt its thoughts." The subconscious tells the "I": "Feel pain here!" So the "I" hurts and tries to figure out how to stop the pain – that’s why it thinks.

The subconscious tells the "I": "Feel desire or happiness here!" Then the "I" feels good and thinks about how to feel happy again – that’s why it thinks.

I want to talk to the people who look down on the body. They only do that because they actually care about it. But where do respect, caring, hate, value, and will come from?

The creative subconscious made respect, hate, joy, and pain for itself. The body created the spirit as a way to show its will.

Even when you act foolish and hate your body, you’re still serving yourself. I tell you, your self actually wants to die and is turning away from life.

Your subconscious can’t do what it wants most anymore: to create beyond itself. That is its biggest passion.

But now it’s too late. So your self wants to give up, you haters of the body.

Your subconscious wants to die, and that’s why you hate your body. You can’t create anything beyond yourselves anymore.

That’s why you’re angry at life and the earth. An unconscious jealousy shows in your hateful look.

I won’t follow you, haters of the body! To me, you are not a path to a better person! That’s what Zarathustra said.

My brother, when you have a virtue that is truly yours, no one else has it.
