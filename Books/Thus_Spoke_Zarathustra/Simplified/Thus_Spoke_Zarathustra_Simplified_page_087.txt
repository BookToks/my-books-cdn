Oh, this is how light can be tough on the shining one: it never stops chasing after it.

The shining one isn’t treated fairly deep down, and the suns are cold like that: that’s how every sun moves.

The suns move like a storm: that’s how they travel.

They follow their strong will without stopping: that’s why they seem cold.

But you, dark ones of the night, are the only ones who take warmth from the shining ones! You’re the only ones who drink milk and find comfort from the light!

Ah, there is ice all around me; my hand feels frozen! Ah, I am thirsty; I long for your thirst!

It’s night: I wish I didn’t have to be light! I wish I could want the night! I feel so lonely!

It’s night: now my longing bursts out like a fountain—I want to talk.

It’s night: now all fountains are louder. My soul is like a fountain too.

It’s night: now all songs of lovers start. My soul is like a lover’s song too. This is what Zarathustra sang.

One evening, Zarathustra and his followers walked through the forest. When he looked for a well, he found a green meadow surrounded by trees and bushes, where girls were dancing together.

As soon as the girls saw Zarathustra, they stopped dancing; but Zarathustra smiled kindly and said: Don’t stop dancing, beautiful girls! I’m not here to ruin your fun or to be your enemy.

I speak for God but also for the devil: the devil is the serious spirit.

How could I, you light-footed dancers, be against your divine dances? Or against your graceful feet?

Sure, I am like a forest and a dark night: but if you aren’t afraid of my darkness, you’ll find rose-covered banks beneath my tall trees.
