The idea made this pale man even paler. He was capable of doing what he did when he did it, but after it was done, he couldn’t handle the thought of it.

Now, he always saw himself as the person who did that one thing. I call this madness: his exception became the rule.

A simple chalk line tricks the hen; the action he took tricked his weak mind. Madness after the deed, that’s what I call it.

Listen, judges! There is another kind of madness, and it happens before the deed. You haven’t looked deep enough into this person’s soul!

The red judge says, "Why did this criminal commit murder? He wanted to rob." But I tell you, his soul wanted blood, not treasure; he craved the thrill of the knife!

His weak mind didn’t understand this madness and convinced him otherwise. It said, "Why worry about blood? At least try to get some loot or revenge." So he listened to his weak mind and robbed when he murdered. He didn’t want to feel ashamed of his madness.

Now his guilt weighs heavily on him again, and his weak mind is numb, paralyzed, and dull.

If he could just shake his head, the burden would lift; but who shakes that head?

Who is this man? A bundle of sickness that reaches out into the world through his spirit, trying to catch its prey.

Who is this man? A coil of wild snakes that rarely get along and go out separately to hunt in the world.

Look at that poor body! What it suffered and wanted, the poor soul understood as a desire to kill and the thrill of the knife.

Now he feels sick, caught by the evil that is now evil: he wants to cause pain with what causes him pain. But there were other times, with different evils and goods.

Long ago, doubt was evil, and wanting to be yourself was evil. Then the sick became outcasts or sorcerers; as outcasts or sorcerers, they suffered and tried to make others suffer.

But you won’t hear this; it hurts your good people, you say.

But why should I care about your good people?

Many things in your good people disgust me, and not just their evil.
