Even in your ears, you great people, it whispers its sad lies!

It finds the kind hearts who give themselves freely!

Yes, it finds you too, you who defeated the old God! You got tired of fighting, and now your tiredness serves the new idol!

Heroes and honorable ones, it wants to build the new idol around it! It happily enjoys the feeling of good consciences – the cold monster!

It will give you everything if you worship this new idol: it buys your good deeds and your proud looks.

It tries to attract many people through you! Yes, a terrible trick has been made here, a death-horse dressed up like a god!

Yes, a dying for many has been made, which pretends to be life: truly, a big favor to all who teach death!

I call it the state, where everyone drinks poison, the good and the bad; the state where everyone loses themselves, the good and the bad; the state where slow suicide is called “life.” Just look at these extra people! They steal the work of creators and the treasures of the wise. They call their theft culture – and everything becomes sickness and trouble for them!

Just look at these extra people! They are always sick; they throw up their anger and call it a newspaper. They eat each other up and can’t even handle themselves.

Just look at these extra people! They get rich but become poorer because of it. They want power, and above all, money – these powerless ones!

See them climb, these quick monkeys! They climb over each other and fall into the mud and the abyss.

They all want to reach the throne: it’s their madness – like happiness sits on the throne! Often filth sits on the throne – and often the throne sits on filth.

They all seem crazy to me, climbing monkeys, too eager.

Their idol smells bad to me, the cold monster: all these idolaters smell bad to me.

My brothers, will you choke on their bad smells and greedy desires? Better break the windows and jump into fresh air!

Get away from the bad smell! Leave the idol worship of the extra people!

Get away from the bad smell! Leave the steam of these human sacrifices!

The earth is still open for great souls.
