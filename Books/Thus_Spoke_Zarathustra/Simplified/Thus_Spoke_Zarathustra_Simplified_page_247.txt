Zarathustra thought to himself, "Wow, I really like these better people now!" but he didn’t say it out loud because he wanted to respect their happiness and quietness.

Then something surprising happened on this very long day: the ugliest man started making weird noises again, and after a while, he finally spoke. He asked a clear and important question that touched everyone’s hearts.

"My friends," said the ugliest man, "what do you think? Because of today, I’m happy I’ve lived my whole life.

And even that’s not enough for me. It’s worth living on Earth: one day, one special day with Zarathustra, has made me love the Earth.

When I face death, I’ll say, ‘Was that life?’ And I’ll say, ‘Yes! One more time!’ What do you think? Will you say the same to death: ‘Was that life? For Zarathustra, yes! One more time!’" The ugliest man said this not long before midnight.

What do you think happened then? When the better men heard his question, they suddenly realized how much they had changed and healed, and they knew Zarathustra was the reason. So they ran to him, thanking him, honoring him, hugging him, and kissing his hands in their own ways. Some laughed, some cried. The old wise man danced happily; some say he was drunk, but really, he was full of joy and had no more tiredness. Some even say the donkey danced too, since the ugliest man had given it wine before. Whether the donkey danced or not, something even more amazing happened. As Zarathustra’s saying goes, "What does it matter!"

When all this was happening with the ugliest man, Zarathustra looked like he was drunk: his eyes were blurry, his words stumbled, and he almost fell. Nobody knew what he was thinking. It seemed like his mind was far away, like a cloud drifting high on mountain ridges between two seas, lost between the past and the future.
