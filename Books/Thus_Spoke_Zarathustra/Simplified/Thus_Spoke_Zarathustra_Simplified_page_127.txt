But there was a man lying there! And there! The dog was jumping, its fur standing on end, whining like it saw me coming—then it howled again and cried out. Had I ever heard a dog cry so desperately for help?

And truly, what I saw was something I had never seen before. A young shepherd was twisting and choking, shaking, his face all twisted, with a big black snake hanging out of his mouth.

Had I ever seen such disgust and pale horror on one face?

Maybe he had fallen asleep? Then the snake had slithered into his throat and bitten itself deep inside.

I grabbed the snake and pulled—hard—but it was no use! I couldn’t pull the snake out of his throat. Then I shouted: "Bite! Bite! Off its head! Bite!"—all my fear, hate, disgust, and pity came out in my voice.

You brave people around me! Adventurers who sail into unknown seas! You who love mysteries!

Help me figure out this mystery I saw, explain the vision of the loneliest one!

Because it was a vision and a warning: what was I really seeing?

Who is the one who will come someday?

Who is the shepherd with the snake crawling into his throat? Who is the man who will have the darkest and heaviest things crawl inside him?

But the shepherd bit just like I told him to; he bit hard! He spit out the snake’s head far away—and jumped up.

No longer a shepherd, no longer just a man—but changed, shining with light, laughing! No man on earth had ever laughed like that!

Oh my brothers, I heard a laugh that wasn’t human—and now a thirst, a longing that will never go away, gnaws at me.

My longing for that laugh eats at me: oh, how can I still live? And how could I want to die now? So spoke Zarathustra.

With these mysteries and pain in his heart, Zarathustra sailed across the sea.
