The hour hand kept moving, and my life’s clock seemed to breathe – I had never felt such quiet all around me, and it scared my heart.

Then I heard a voice without sound say, “You know it, Zarathustra?” I was terrified by this whisper, and my face went pale, but I stayed silent.

Again, the silent voice said, “You know it, Zarathustra, but you don’t say it!” Finally, I answered, kind of defiant, “Yes, I know it, but I won’t say it!” Then the voice spoke again, “You won’t, Zarathustra? Is that true? Don’t hide behind your defiance!” I cried and shook like a child and said, “I wish I could, but how? Please let me off this! It’s too hard for me!”

The voice said again, “What does it matter what you want, Zarathustra? Say your word and accept it!” I answered, “Is it really my word? Who am I? I’m waiting for someone better; I’m not even worthy to accept it.”

The voice spoke once more, “What does it matter about you? You’re not humble enough yet. Humility is tough.” I said, “My humility has been tested so much! I live at the base of my greatness; no one knows how high my peaks are, but I know my valleys well.”

The voice said again, “Zarathustra, if you want to move mountains, you also have to move valleys and flat lands.” I answered, “So far, my words haven’t moved mountains, and people haven’t really heard me. I went to them, but I haven’t reached them yet.”

The voice said again, “How do you know? The dew falls on grass when the night is the quietest.” I replied, “They made fun of me when I found my own path and followed it, and my feet did shake.

They said, ‘You forgot the path before, now you even forget how to walk!’” The voice said once more, “Who cares about their mocking! You are someone who has unlearned how to obey; now it’s time for you to lead!

Don’t you know who everyone needs most? The one who can command great things.”
