The old man went back inside but came out soon after with bread and wine for Zarathustra. "This is a bad place for hungry people," he said. "That's why I live here. Animals and people come to me, the hermit. But tell your friend to eat and drink too, he looks more tired than you." Zarathustra answered, "My friend is dead; I can’t really convince him." The old man grumbled, "I don’t care. Anyone who knocks on my door must take what I give. Eat and go!"

After that, Zarathustra walked for two more hours, trusting the path and the stars. He was used to walking at night and liked seeing everything that was asleep. When morning came, he found himself in a thick forest with no path in sight. So he put the dead man inside a hollow tree to keep him safe from wolves. Then Zarathustra lay down on the ground and moss, with his head under the tree. Soon, he fell asleep, tired but calm.

Zarathustra slept a long time. Not only did the pink dawn touch his face, but the whole morning passed too. Finally, his eyes opened. He stared at the quiet forest and then at himself, amazed. He stood up quickly, like a sailor who suddenly sees land, and felt happy because he had found a new truth. He said to himself: A light has come to me. I need friends—real, living friends, not dead ones or bodies I carry with me.

I need friends who want to follow me because they want to, wherever I go. A light has come to me.

Zarathustra should not talk to all people, but to friends! He should not be a shepherd or a sheepdog for the herd!

I came to pull many away from the herd. The people and the herd will be angry with me: they will say Zarathustra is a thief.

I call them herdsmen, but they call themselves good and fair. I call them herdsmen, but they say they believe in the true faith.

Look at the good and fair! Who do they hate the most? The one who breaks their rules, the breaker, the lawbreaker; but he is also the creator.
