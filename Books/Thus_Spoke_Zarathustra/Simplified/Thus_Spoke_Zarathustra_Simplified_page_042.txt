I see a lot of soldiers, but I wish I saw more true warriors! They call what you wear a "uniform," but I hope what’s inside you isn’t all the same.

You will always be looking for an enemy—your enemy. Some of you even hate people the moment you see them.

You will find your enemy, fight your battles, all for what you believe in! And if your beliefs ever fail, your honesty will still win.

You will love peace because it gives you time to get ready for new fights—and you’ll prefer short peace over long peace.

I don’t tell you to just work, but to fight. I don’t tell you to seek peace, but to seek victory. Let your work be a fight, and your peace a victory!

People only stay quiet and calm when they’re ready with their weapons; otherwise, they talk and argue a lot. So make your peace a victory!

You say that a good reason makes war okay? I say, a good war makes any reason okay.

War and courage have done more great things than kindness. It’s not your pity, but your bravery that has saved people so far.

You ask, "What is good?" Being brave is good. Little girls might say, "Good means pretty and sweet." They call you heartless, but your heart is real, and I love how shy you are about being kind. You’re embarrassed about how much you give, while others are ashamed of how little they give.

You think you’re ugly? Then, my friends, wear your ugly proudly like a special cloak!

When your soul grows big, it also gets wild, and in that greatness, there’s some wildness too. I understand you.

In wildness, the strong and the weak meet, but they don’t get each other. I know you.

You should only hate your enemies, not look down on them. Be proud of your enemies; then when they win, it’s like you’ve won too.

Giving up is what a slave does. Let your pride be in obeying orders. Let your power come from following orders!

A good warrior likes being told what to do more than saying "I will." You should be ready to do what you’re told before anything else you want.

Love life by loving your biggest hope; and let your biggest hope be the most important idea about life!

But your biggest hope must be what I tell you: people are meant to become better than they are now.

So live your life obeying and fighting!
