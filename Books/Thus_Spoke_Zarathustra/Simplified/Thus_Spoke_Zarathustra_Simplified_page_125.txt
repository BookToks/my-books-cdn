You threw yourself so high, but every stone that’s thrown has to fall!

You’re blaming yourself and punishing yourself: Oh Zarathustra, you threw your stone far away—but it will bounce right back at you!" Then the dwarf went quiet; it stayed quiet for a long time. The silence felt heavy to me; being with someone like this sometimes makes you feel even lonelier than being alone!

I climbed up, I climbed up, I dreamed, I thought—but everything felt heavy. I felt like someone sick, tired of pain, and waking up to even worse dreams after just falling asleep.

But there’s something inside me I call courage: it has helped me fight off every sadness so far. This courage finally told me to stop and say: "Dwarf! It’s you or me!" Because courage is the best fighter—it attacks, and every attack sounds like a victory.

Humans are the bravest animals—that’s how we’ve beaten all other animals. We’ve faced pain with a sound of victory; but human pain is the worst of all.

Courage also fights dizziness when looking into scary, deep places: and where doesn’t a person stand near something deep and scary? Even just seeing means looking into deep, scary places.

Courage is the best fighter: it even fights the pain of sharing others’ suffering. Feeling pain together is the deepest scary place of all: the deeper you look into life, the deeper you look into pain.

But courage is the best fighter, the one that attacks: it even fights death itself; it says, "Was that life? Well! Let’s try again!" There’s a strong sound of victory in those words. Anyone who can listen, listen well.

“Stop, dwarf!” I said. “It’s either me or you! I’m stronger: you don’t know how deep my thoughts are! You couldn’t handle them!” Then something happened that made me feel lighter: the dwarf jumped off my shoulder, that curious little spirit! It sat down on a stone in front of me.

Right where we stopped, there was a gate.

“Look at this gate, dwarf!” I said. “It has two sides. Two roads meet here—but no one has ever reached the end of either.

This long road behind us goes on forever. And that long road ahead—also goes on forever.

They are opposite to each other, these roads; they touch right here at this gate.

Above the gate is written: ‘This Moment.’ But if you kept following them, further and further, dwarf, do you think these roads would always be opposite?”
