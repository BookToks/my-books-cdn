If a person's family liked women, strong wine, and wild boar meat, how could that person expect to live a pure life?  

That would be silly! It seems strange to me if someone like that tries to be the husband of one, two, or even three women.  

And if he built monasteries and put signs on them saying, "The way to holiness," I would still think, what's the point? That would be another silly thing!  

He made a place for himself to do penance and hide away: maybe it helps, but I don’t really believe it.  

When you're alone, what grows inside you depends on what you bring with you—even the wild, rough parts of your nature. So being alone isn’t good for many people.  

Has there ever been anything dirtier on earth than the saints who lived alone in the wilderness? Around them, not only the devil was loose but also wild pigs.

I’ve seen you higher men acting shy, embarrassed, and awkward, like a tiger that missed its chance to jump. You tried something and it failed.  

But what does it matter, you gamblers! You didn’t learn how to play and joke properly, like you’re supposed to! Don’t we all sit together at a big table just to joke and play?  

If you failed at big things, does that mean you are failures? And if you are failures, does that mean all humans are failures? If humans are failures, well, then it doesn’t matter!

The more advanced something is, the less often it succeeds. Haven’t all you higher men failed at times?  

Don’t be sad; what does it matter? There’s still so much you can do!  

Learn to laugh at yourselves, like you should!  

Is it any surprise that you’ve failed or only partly succeeded, you broken ones? Doesn’t humanity’s future fight and struggle inside you?  

All of humanity’s greatest, deepest, and highest powers mix together inside you!  

Is it surprising that many break? Learn to laugh at yourselves, like you should! You higher men, so much is still possible!  

And really, so much has already been done! This earth is full of small, good, perfect things, things that work well!  

Surround yourself with small, good, perfect things, you higher men. Their golden fullness heals the heart. Perfection teaches hope.
