When the kings talked excitedly about how happy their fathers were, Zarathustra felt like making fun of them because they seemed like very calm and peaceful kings with old, gentle faces. But he held back. "Well!" he said, "there is the way, and there is my cave; today will be a long evening! But right now, a cry for help is pulling me away from you.

It would be an honor if kings wanted to wait in my cave, but you’ll have to wait a long time!

Well! What does that matter? Where else do people learn to wait better than at royal courts? And isn’t the main skill kings have today just knowing how to wait?" Zarathustra said this thoughtfully.

Then Zarathustra walked on, going further down through forests and swampy areas. Like anyone thinking deeply about tough problems, he didn’t see a man lying on the ground and accidentally stepped on him. Suddenly, the man screamed in pain and shouted many curses at him. Zarathustra was so surprised he raised his stick and hit the man too. But right after, he calmed down and laughed at how silly he had been.

"Sorry," he said to the angry man who had stood up and sat down again. "Please forgive me and listen to a story first.

It's like a traveler dreaming about faraway things on a lonely road who suddenly bumps into a sleeping dog lying in the sun. Both jump up and snap at each other, scared like enemies. That’s what happened to us.

But, still, it was close for them to become friends — that dog and that lonely traveler! Aren’t they both lonely?" 

The man, still angry, said, "Whoever you are, your story and your foot are both too close to me!

Am I a dog?" Then the man stood up and pulled his bare arm out of the swamp. He had been lying stretched out on the ground, hidden like someone waiting quietly in the swamp.
