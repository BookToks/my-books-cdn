False wisdom is what all slaves, old and tired people pretend to have; especially the tricky, fake-smart, and nosy foolishness of priests!

The fake wise ones—priests, people who are tired of the world, and those with weak and submissive souls—how much have they taken advantage of selfishness!

And that was supposed to be called virtue—using selfishness for their own gain! And all those tired, scared, and grumpy people wanted to be "selfless" for good reasons.

But now comes the day of change, the moment of truth, the big judgment; many secrets will be revealed!

The one who says that loving yourself is good and selfishness is blessed really knows what’s coming: "Look, night is falling, the big moment is here!" That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 3, (11) THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY 1.

My voice speaks for regular people: I talk too rough and honest for weaklings. My words sound strange to all the writers and thinkers who hide behind their pens.

My hand is a fool’s hand: it messes up tables and walls with silly drawings and scribbles!

My foot is like a horse’s foot; it stomps over sticks and stones, running through fields, loving to race fast.

My stomach must be like an eagle’s stomach because it likes lamb meat.

Yes, it’s like a bird’s stomach.

It’s fed on simple, pure things, and is always ready and eager to fly away—that’s part of my nature!

And especially because I hate the heavy, serious spirit that weighs people down—that’s bird nature too. I really hate it, a lot, from the start! Oh, how many places my hate has flown and gone wrong!

I could sing a song about this—and I will—even if I’m all alone in an empty house, singing only to myself.
