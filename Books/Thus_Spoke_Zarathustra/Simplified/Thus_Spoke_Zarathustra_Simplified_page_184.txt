But you also know that my happiness feels heavy, not like water flowing gently. It presses down on me and won’t go away, like hot, sticky tar.

Then my animals walked around me carefully and stood in front of me again. “O Zarathustra,” they said, “is that why you’re getting more yellow and darker, even though your hair looks white and light? Look, you’re sitting in your tar!”

“What are you saying, my animals?” I laughed. “I was just joking when I talked about tar. What happens to me is like what happens to fruits when they get ripe. It’s the honey in my veins that makes my blood thicker and my soul calmer.”

“That’s right, Zarathustra,” my animals said and came closer. “But won’t you climb a tall mountain today? The air is fresh, and you can see more of the world than ever.”

“Yes, my animals,” I said. “Your advice is perfect and makes me happy. I will climb a tall mountain today! But make sure there is honey ready for me—yellow, white, cold, sweet honey. Because when I’m up there, I will make a honey sacrifice.”

When I reached the top, I sent my animals home and found I was alone. Then I laughed from deep inside, looked around, and said: Talking about sacrifices and honey sacrifices was just a trick, a useful kind of nonsense! Up here, I can speak more freely than I could before, near caves and the homes of mountain hermits.

What to sacrifice? I waste what I get, with a thousand hands. How could I call that a sacrifice?

And when I wanted honey, I really wanted bait, sweet stuff that even growling bears and strange, angry birds want—bait like hunters and fishermen use. If the world is like a dark forest full of animals and wild hunters, it feels more like a deep, rich sea.

A sea full of colorful fish and crabs that even gods might want to catch, because the world is full of amazing things, big and small!

Especially the human world, the human sea. That’s where I now throw my golden fishing rod and say: Open up, human ocean!

Open up and give me your fish and shining crabs! With my best bait, I’ll attract the strangest human fish today!

I throw my happiness far and wide, from east to south to west, to see if many human fish will try to grab my happiness. Until, biting my sharp hidden hooks, they have to rise up to my level, the most colorful deep-sea creatures, to the craftiest fishermen of people.
