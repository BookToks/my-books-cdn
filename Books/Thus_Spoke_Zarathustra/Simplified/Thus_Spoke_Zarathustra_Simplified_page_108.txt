He pulled his tail in, said "bow-wow!" in a scared voice, and slowly went down into his cave. That’s what Zarathustra said. But his followers didn’t really pay attention to him because they were too excited to talk about the sailors, the rabbits, and the flying man.

"What am I supposed to think about this?" Zarathustra said. "Am I really a ghost?

Maybe it was just my shadow. You’ve probably heard the story of the Wanderer and his Shadow?

One thing’s for sure: I need to keep a better grip on it, or else it will ruin my reputation." Zarathustra shook his head and wondered again. "What am I supposed to think about this?" he said once more.

"Why did the ghost shout: ‘It’s time! It’s the highest time!’? What does ‘the highest time’ even mean?" Zarathustra asked.

Part 2, (19) THE SOOTHSAYER

"And I saw a deep sadness come over people. The best ones got tired of their work.

A new belief showed up, and a faith ran with it: ‘Everything is empty, everything is the same, everything has already happened!’ From every hill, people kept saying: ‘Everything is empty, everything is the same, everything has already happened!’ Sure, we worked hard and got results, but why did all our fruits turn rotten and brown? What fell last night from the bad moon?

All our work was useless, our wine turned into poison, the evil eye burned our fields and hearts yellow.

We’ve all become dry inside; when fire falls on us, we turn to dust and ashes – even the fire is tired now.

All our fountains have dried up, even the sea has pulled back. The ground wants to swallow us, but it can’t!

‘Oh no, where is there still a sea deep enough to drown in?’ This is what we complain about – over shallow swamps.

Honestly, we’re even too tired to die; now we just stay awake and keep living – like we’re already in graves." 

This is what Zarathustra heard the soothsayer say; the warning touched his heart and changed him.
