You’re so full of anger and revenge, it’s obvious to me!

But your harsh words still hurt me, even when you’re right! And even if what Zarathustra says is true a hundred times over, you still use my words in the wrong way!

That’s what Zarathustra said. Then he looked at the big city and sighed, staying quiet for a long time. Finally, he said: I hate this city too, not just this fool. There’s nothing here that can get better or worse anymore.

This city is in trouble! I wish I could already see the fire that will burn it all up!

Because big fires like that have to come before a great change. But that change will come in its own time. Before I go, here’s some advice for you, fool: When you can’t love something anymore, it’s better to just walk away! Zarathustra said this and then left the fool and the big city behind.

Oh, has everything already lost its color and life that was once so bright and full of hope? I brought so much hope back to my beehives!

But those young hearts have already grown old—not in a good way!

They’re just tired, boring, and comfortable now. They say, “We’ve become good and pious again.” Not long ago, I saw them run out early in the morning, full of courage. But now their knowledge is tired, and they even make fun of their own bravery from before!

Many of them once moved like dancers; my wisdom even smiled at them—then they started to think twice.

Just now, I saw them bow down to crawl to the cross.

They used to fly around light and freedom like little bugs and young poets. But now they’re older and colder, and they’ve turned into tricksters, mumblers, and weaklings.

Did their hearts lose hope because loneliness swallowed me whole like a whale?
