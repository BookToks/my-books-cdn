Just a poet?

Is he really chasing the truth?

Not stiff, smooth, and cold like a statue,  
Not something placed in front of temples,  
Like a god’s guard standing still.  

No! He hates being like those truth statues.  
He’s more at home in deserts than temples,  
Jumping through every window,  
Full of wild, playful energy.  

He sniffs around every forest,  
Eager and curious,  
Hoping you’ll roam the wild woods,  
Among fierce, colorful creatures,  
Making noise and moving freely,  
With hungry lips,  
Mocking and wild,  
Sometimes good, sometimes bad,  
Stealing, hiding, lying—always roaming.  

Or like eagles staring down a cliff,  
Watching deeply below,  
Spinning down into the depths!  

Then suddenly, with sharp aim,  
Flying fast,  
Pouncing on little lambs,  
Hungry and fierce,  
Against all gentle lamb spirits,  
Angry at anything soft and kind,  
Grey and soft like woolly lambs!
