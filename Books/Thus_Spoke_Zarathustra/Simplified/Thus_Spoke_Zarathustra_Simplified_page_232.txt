Mere poet!
 
 He - of truth the wooer?
 
 Not still, stiff, smooth and cold, Become an image, A godlike statue, Set up in front of temples, As a God's own door-guard: No! hostile to all such truthfulness-statues, In every desert homelier than at temples, With cattish wantonness, Through every window leaping Quickly into chances, Every wild forest a-sniffing, Greedily-longingly, sniffing, That you, in wild forests, 'Mong the motley-speckled fierce creatures, Should rove, sinful-sound and fine-coloured, With longing lips smacking, Blessedly mocking, blessedly hellish, blessedly blood-thirsty, Robbing, skulking, lying - roving: Or to eagles like which fixedly, Long adown the precipice look, Adown their precipice: - Oh, how they whirl down now, Thereunder, therein, To ever deeper profoundness whirling!Then, Sudden, With aim aright, With quivering flight, On lambkins pouncing, Headlong down, sore-hungry, For lambkins longing, Fierce 'gainst all lamb-spirits, Furious-fierce all that look 232 Sheeplike, or lambeyed, or crisp-woolly, -Grey, with lambsheep kindliness!
