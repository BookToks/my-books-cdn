Oh my soul, I helped you wash away all the small shame and fake goodness, and I convinced you to stand completely open in the sunlight.

With the storm called "spirit," I blew across your wild sea; I cleared away all the clouds; I even stopped the thing called "sin." Oh my soul, I gave you the power to say No like a storm, and to say Yes like the clear sky: calm and bright, now you walk through storms that try to deny you.

Oh my soul, I gave you freedom over everything made and not made; and who else knows, like you do, how exciting the future can be?

Oh my soul, I taught you a kind of respect that doesn’t eat you up inside, a big, loving respect that loves the most where it also looks down the most.

Oh my soul, I taught you how to convince so well that even the ground itself listens to you: like the sun, which convinces the sea to rise up.

Oh my soul, I took away all the obeying and bowing down; I gave you new names like "Change of need" and "Fate." I gave you fun new names and bright toys, calling you "Fate," "the Circuit of circuits," "the Navel-string of time," and "the Azure bell." Oh my soul, I gave you all wisdom to enjoy all new ideas, and also all the oldest, strongest wisdom.

Oh my soul, every sun I shone on you, every night, every silence, and every longing—then you grew for me like a vine.

Oh my soul, now you stand strong and full, like a vine with heavy clusters of golden grapes—filled with happiness, waiting with so much to give, but still a little shy about it.

Oh my soul, there’s no soul more loving, more understanding, or bigger than you! Where else could the future and past be so close?

Oh my soul, I gave you everything, and my hands are empty because of you—so now! Now you smile at me, a little sad but full, and say: "Who should thank whom? Doesn’t the giver thank the receiver for accepting? Isn’t giving something we have to do? And isn’t receiving also an act of kindness?" Oh my soul, I get your sad smile: even your huge abundance now reaches out, full of longing!
