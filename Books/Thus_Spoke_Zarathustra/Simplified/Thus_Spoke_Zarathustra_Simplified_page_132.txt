And "if someone can’t bless, they will learn to curse!" - this clear idea came to me like a bright star in the sky; it shines for me even on the darkest nights.

I am someone who blesses and says "yes," especially when you are near me, pure and shining like the sky! I bring my positive "yes" into all the dark places.

I have become a blesser and a yes-sayer: that’s why I worked hard for a long time, hoping to one day have the chance to bless freely.

My blessing is this: to stand above everything like its own sky, its round roof, its blue bell, and its forever safe place. And blessed is anyone who can bless like that!

Everything is touched by eternity, beyond good and evil; good and evil are just temporary shadows and passing clouds.

It’s truly a blessing, not a bad thing, when I say that "above all things is the sky of chance, the sky of innocence, the sky of risk, the sky of wild freedom." "Risk" is the oldest kind of honor in the world; I gave that back to everything; I freed them from being controlled by purpose.

I placed this freedom and calm like a blue bell above everything when I said that no "eternal will" controls or plans everything.

I put this wild freedom and craziness instead of that will, when I said "in everything, one thing is impossible - being completely reasonable!" A little reason, sure, a tiny bit of wisdom spread across the stars - that’s mixed in everything: wisdom is there to make the craziness better!

A little wisdom is possible; but the great peace I found is that things like to dance on the feet of chance.

Oh sky above me! Pure, high sky! Your purity now means to me that there is no forever spider or spiderweb of reason: you are a dance floor for divine chances, a table for gods to roll their dice and play!

But why do you blush? Have I said something I shouldn’t? Have I been rude when I meant to bless you?

Or is it the shame of there being two of us that makes you blush? Are you telling me to be quiet because now – the day is coming?
