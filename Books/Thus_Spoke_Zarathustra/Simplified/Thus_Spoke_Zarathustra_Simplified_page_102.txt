If you grab them, they kick up dust like flour sacks without meaning to. But who would guess that dust comes from corn, and from the bright yellow summer fields?

When they act smart, their little sayings and truths make me feel cold. Their "wisdom" often smells like a swamp, and sometimes I even hear a frog croaking in it!

They are clever—they have skillful fingers. What can my simple self do compared to all they do? Their fingers know how to thread, knit, and weave. That’s how they make the socks of the spirit!

They are like good clocks, but you have to be careful to wind them up right!

Then they tell the time without mistakes and make a quiet sound.

They work like millstones and pestles: just give them seed corn! They know how to grind it finely and turn it into white dust.

They watch each other closely and don’t trust each other much. Clever with small tricks, they wait for those who don’t know much—like spiders waiting.

I saw them always prepare their poison carefully, always wearing glass gloves on their fingers.

They also know how to cheat with fake dice; I saw them play so eagerly they even sweat.

We are strangers to each other, and their good qualities bother me more than their lies and fake dice.

When I lived with them, I lived above them. That’s why they didn’t like me.

They don’t want to hear about anyone being better than them, so they put wood, dirt, and trash between me and their heads.

That’s how they block out the sound of my steps; so far, even the smartest haven’t heard me.

They put all of humanity’s faults and weaknesses between themselves and me—this is called a "false ceiling" in their homes.

But still, I think above their heads; even if I walk on my own mistakes, I am still above them.

Because people aren’t equal, says justice. What I want, they can’t want! This is what Zarathustra said.

"Since I have learned more about the body," Zarathustra told a student, "the spirit feels like just a symbol to me; and everything 'immortal' is just a comparison too."
