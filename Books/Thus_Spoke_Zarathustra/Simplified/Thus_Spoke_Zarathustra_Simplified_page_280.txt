But we don’t understand the joke.

The heavy stress of making decisions is like asking, “Will this save me from dying?” Forget that. Just follow your spirit instead.

The Iron Law of Yin-Yang says there’s no happiness or suffering alone. They flow between each other. Happiness happens when suffering ends. Suffering happens when happiness disappears. There wouldn’t be happiness without suffering.

There wouldn’t be suffering without happiness either. This flow is wild and mysterious. Yin-yang works for everything in the world: good and evil, joy and fear, peace and struggle, knowing and not knowing, waves and particles, energy and matter, power and laughter, light and darkness, and more. Yin-yang makes the world move and change.

Human progress has always been... zero. The more knowledge schools collect, the more chances there are to be ignorant, because people get stuck in their ideas instead of seeing things clearly.

The more comfortable and safe one generation is, remembering tough times, the more their kids will act out and look for excitement. The more tech we have, the more bored and nervous we get. The more we watch fake stuff on screens, the more our bodies feel it’s empty and unreal. America’s big job seems to be showing that you can’t really make the world better.

We shouldn’t feel sorry or jealous of anyone. A baby turtle rushing to the sea only to be eaten isn’t luckier or unluckier than a Nobel prize winner who worked hard but lost his family. Both lives have happiness and suffering, and this keeps happening forever. I don’t know which life is more boring.

“No progress? Trying won’t make things better or happier? So why bother?” Go ahead, do nothing... until you get bored and your body tells you to do something fun and forget about yin-yang. Doing nothing is just another way to try to escape yin-yang. The universe is laughing at that.

Will thinking about this forever make you or humanity better?
