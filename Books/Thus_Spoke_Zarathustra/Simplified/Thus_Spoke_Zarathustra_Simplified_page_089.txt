— then I said excitedly, “Ah, yes! Wisdom!

People want her but never get enough, they try to see through mysteries and catch her like in a trap.

Is she pretty? I don’t know! But even old fish still chase after her.

She changes all the time and is difficult; I’ve seen her bite her lip and run her fingers the wrong way through her hair.

Maybe she’s tricky and not honest, like a real woman; but when she talks badly about herself, that’s when she’s most tempting.” When I said this to Life, she laughed slyly and closed her eyes. “Who are you talking about?” she asked. “Maybe it’s me?

And if you’re right—should you say that to my face?

But now, please, tell me about your Wisdom!” Ah, now you’ve opened your eyes again, dear Life! And I felt like I was diving deep into the unknown. That’s how Zarathustra sang. But when the dance ended and the girls left, he felt sad.

“The sun set a long time ago,” he said finally, “the grass is wet, and coolness comes from the forest.

I feel something strange watching me, thinking deeply. What! You’re still alive, Zarathustra?

Why? How? Where? What for? Isn’t it crazy to keep living? Oh, my friends; it’s evening that makes me ask these questions. Please forgive me for feeling sad!

Evening has come; forgive me that evening has come!” That’s how Zarathustra sang.

Part 2, (11) THE GRAVE-SONG “Over there is the grave island, the quiet place; over there are the graves of my youth. That’s where I will take a wreath that never dies.” With this promise in my heart, I sailed over the sea. Oh, sights and memories from my youth! Oh, all the shining moments of love, those quick, beautiful flashes! How did you die so soon for me? Today, I think of you as my dead friends.

From you, my dearest dead, comes a sweet feeling that opens and softens my heart.
