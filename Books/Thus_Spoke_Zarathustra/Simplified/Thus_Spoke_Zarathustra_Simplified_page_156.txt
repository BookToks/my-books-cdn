When I started thinking about people, I saw that they were stuck on an old idea: everyone believed they already knew what was good and bad for humans.  

Talking about being good and bad felt boring to them, like something they said just before going to sleep.  

I shook things up by saying no one really knows what’s good or bad—except maybe the one who created everything!  

This creator is the one who decides what humans aim for and gives life meaning and a future. Only this creator can say what is good or bad.  

I told people to throw away their old beliefs and stop listening to their famous thinkers, saints, poets, and heroes.  

I told them to laugh at the sad wise people who always warned others like scary scarecrows hanging on the tree of life.  

I sat on the big road where all those old ideas passed by, even next to dead things and vultures, and I laughed at the past and its fading glory.  

I shouted at all their greatness and smallness like a preacher full of anger and shame. Their best was so small!  

And their worst was also so small! That’s why I laughed.  

My wild, mountain-born wisdom cried and laughed inside me—a big, restless feeling.  

Sometimes it lifted me up, flying like an arrow full of happy energy, taking me far into futures no one has dreamed of.  

Places warmer than any artist imagined, where gods dance without clothes and feel shy about it. (I speak in stories and stumble like a poet because I’m still learning to be one!)  

There, becoming was like gods dancing and playing, the world wild and free, always moving and coming back to itself.  

It was like many gods always chasing and finding each other again, happily confusing and reconnecting.  

Time felt like a joyful joke made of moments, and rules felt like freedom itself, playing happily with the challenge of being free.  

There, I met again my old enemy, the spirit of seriousness, and all it made: rules, laws, cause and effect, purpose, will, good and evil.  

Because isn’t there always something bigger to dance beyond?
