"Alpa!" I shouted, "Who carries his ashes to the mountain? Alpa! Alpa! Who carries his ashes to the mountain?"

I pushed the key, pulled at the gate, and tried really hard. But it didn’t open even a little bit. Then a strong, loud wind ripped it apart, whistling and zooming, and threw a black coffin at me.

The coffin burst open with the roaring wind, and out came a thousand laughs.

A thousand funny pictures of kids, angels, owls, fools, and small butterflies laughed and made fun of me.

I was really scared and felt crushed. I cried in terror like never before.

But my crying woke me up—I came back to myself. Zarathustra told this dream and then went quiet because he didn’t understand it yet. But his favorite student quickly got up, grabbed Zarathustra’s hand, and said, "Your life is the meaning of this dream, Zarathustra!

Aren’t you like the loud wind that breaks open Death’s fortress gates?

Aren’t you like the coffin full of colorful, tricky life images?

You come like a thousand kids’ laughs into graves, laughing at the night-watchers and grave guards, and anyone else with scary keys.

Your laughter scares and overwhelms them; you show your power by fainting and then getting up again.

And when the long, tired night comes, you won’t disappear, life’s champion!

You’ve shown us new stars and night wonders; your laughter spreads over us like a colorful roof.

Now children’s laughter will always come from coffins; a strong wind will always beat tiredness—and you are the promise and the prophet of this!

Truly, your enemies were the ones you dreamed about—that was your hardest dream.

But just like you woke up and came back to yourself, they will wake up too—and come to you!

The student said this, and then everyone crowded around Zarathustra, held his hands, and tried to cheer him up to leave his bed and sadness and come back to them."
