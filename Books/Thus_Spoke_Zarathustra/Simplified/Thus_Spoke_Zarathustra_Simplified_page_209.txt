Why do you bother them?

Unless we change and become like cows, we will never enter heaven. We should learn one thing from cows: how to think deeply.

Even if a person gains everything in the world but doesn’t learn how to think deeply, what good is it? They won’t get rid of their pain—the big pain people now call disgust. Who doesn’t feel disgust in their heart, mouth, and eyes? You do! You do! But look at these cows!

The Preacher-on-the-Mount said this, then looked at Zarathustra. His eyes had been kindly on the cows, but now he looked surprised. "Who is this I’m talking to?" he asked, jumping up.

"This is the man without disgust, Zarathustra himself, who has overcome great disgust. This is his eyes, mouth, and heart." While saying this, he kissed Zarathustra’s hands with tears, acting like he had just received a precious gift. The cows just watched and wondered.

“Don’t talk about me, you strange and kind one!” said Zarathustra, holding back his feelings. “Tell me about yourself first! Aren’t you the person who gave up great wealth, was ashamed of it, and went to the poorest to give them everything? But they didn’t accept you.”

“Yes, they didn’t accept me,” said the man who gave away his riches. “So I finally went to the animals and the cows.”

“Then you learned,” Zarathustra interrupted, “that giving is much harder than taking. Giving well is the hardest and finest kind of kindness.”

“Especially now,” said the man who gave away his riches, “because now the low and poor have become proud and rebellious — like the people.

You know the time has come for a big, angry uprising of the poor and slaves. It’s growing and growing!

Now the poor reject all kindness and small gifts, and the super-rich should be careful!

Right now, people who give too much, like bottles with small necks, are in danger—people break these bottles easily.”
