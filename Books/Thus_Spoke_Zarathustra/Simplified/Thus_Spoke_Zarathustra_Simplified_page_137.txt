Always love your neighbor like you love yourself—but first, you have to really love yourself. Love with all your heart, even if others don’t. That’s what Zarathustra, who doesn’t believe in gods, says. But why am I talking when no one’s listening? It’s still too early for me here.

I’m like a warning sign for these people, like a rooster crowing in dark streets.

But their time will come! And so will mine! Every hour, they get smaller, weaker, less useful—like poor plants and bad soil.

Soon, they’ll be like dry grass and empty fields, tired of themselves and desperate for something strong, more than just water!

Oh, the amazing moment like lightning! The mystery before noon! One day, I’ll light a fire in them, and they’ll shout with fiery tongues: The great midday is coming, it’s almost here!

That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 3, (6) WINTER, an unwelcome guest, sits with me at home; my hands turn blue from shaking his cold hand.

I respect this bad guest but prefer to be alone. I like running away from him; if you run fast, you can escape him!

With warm feet and happy thoughts, I run to the calm, sunny corner of my olive hill.

There, I laugh at my strict guest and even like him a bit because he clears out flies and quiets annoying little sounds.

He won’t let a gnat buzz, not even two; he makes the streets lonely so the moonlight feels scared at night.

He’s a tough guest, but I respect him and don’t worship him like weak people worship a fire idol with a big belly.

I’d rather shiver a bit than worship an idol! That’s how I am. I especially don’t like people who get all fired up and obsessed with hot, steamy idols.

I love those I care about more in winter than in summer; I also enjoy making fun of my enemies more when winter is in my house.
