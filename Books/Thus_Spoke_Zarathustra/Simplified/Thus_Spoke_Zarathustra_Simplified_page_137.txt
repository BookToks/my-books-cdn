Love ever your neighbour as yourselves - but first be such as love themselves-Such as love with great love, such as love with great contempt!" Thus speaks Zarathustra the godless.But why talk I, when no one has my ears! It is still an hour too early for me here.
 
 My own forerunner am I among this people, my own cockcrow in dark lanes.
 
 But their hour comes! And there comes also mine! Hourly do they become smaller, poorer, unfruitfuller, - poor herbs! poor earth!
 
 And soon shall they stand before me like dry grass and prairie, and truly, weary of themselves - and panting for fire, more than for water!
 
 O blessed hour of the lightning! O mystery before noontide! - Running fires will I one day make of them, and heralds with flaming tongues:-Herald shall they one day with flaming tongues: It comes, it is close, the great noontide!
 
 Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 3, (6) ON THE OLIVE-MOUNT WINTER, a bad guest, sits with me at home; blue are my hands with his friendly hand-shaking.
 
 I honour him, that bad guest, but gladly leave him alone. Gladly do I run away from him; and when one runs well, then one escapes him!
 
 With warm feet and warm thoughts do I run where the wind is calm to the sunny corner of my olive-mount.
 
 There do I laugh at my stern guest, and am still fond of him; because he clears my house of flies, and quiets many little noises.
 
 For he suffers it not if a gnat wants to buzz, or even two of them; also the lanes makes he lonesome, so that the moonlight is afraid there at night.
 
 A hard guest is he, - but I honour him, and do not worship, like the tenderlings, the pot-bellied fire-idol.
 
 Better even a little teeth-chattering than idol-adoration! - so wills my nature. And especially have I a grudge against all ardent, steaming, steamy fire-idols.
 
 137 Him whom I love, I love better in winter than in summer; better do I now mock at my enemies, and more heartily, when winter sits in my house.
