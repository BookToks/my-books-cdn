My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is this evil; necessary are envy and distrust and slander among the virtues.
 
 Behold how each of your virtues wants the highest place; each wants your whole spirit to be its herald, each wants your whole power, in wrath, hatred, and love.
 
 Each virtue is jealous of every other, and jealousy is a dreadful thing.
 
 Even virtues can perish of jealousy.
 
 He whom the flames of jealousy surround, at last, like the scorpion, turns the poisoned sting against himself.
 
 Ah! my brother, have you never seen a virtue slander and stab itself?
 
 Man is something that must be overcome: and therefore shall you love your virtues, - for you will perish by them.Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (6) THE PALE CRIMINAL You do not mean to slay, you judges and sacrificers, until the animal has bowed its head? Behold. the pale criminal has bowed his head: out of his eye speaks the great contempt.
 
 "My ego is something which is to be overcome: my ego is to me the great contempt of man": that is what his eyes say.
 
 When he judged himself - that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted one relapse again into his baseness!
 
 There is no salvation for him who thus suffers from himself, unless it be speedy death.
 
 Your slaying, you judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that you slay, see to it that you yourselves justify life!
 
 It is not enough that you should reconcile with him whom you slay.
 
 Let your sorrow be love to the overman: thus will you justify your own survival!
 
 "Enemy" shall you say but not "villain," "invalid" shall you say but not "wretch," "fool" shall you say but not "sinner." And you, red judge, if you would say audibly all you have done in thought, then would everyone cry: "Away with the nastiness and the virulent reptile!" 34 But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another thing is the idea of the deed.
