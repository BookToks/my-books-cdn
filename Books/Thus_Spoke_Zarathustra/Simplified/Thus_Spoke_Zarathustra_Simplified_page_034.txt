My brother, are war and fighting bad? Yes, they are bad, but sometimes they are needed; feelings like jealousy, distrust, and gossip happen even among good qualities.

Look how each good quality wants to be the best; each wants your whole soul to support it, and each wants all your strength, whether in anger, hate, or love.

Every good quality is jealous of the others, and jealousy is a terrible thing.

Even good qualities can be destroyed by jealousy.

When jealousy surrounds someone like fire, they can end up hurting themselves like a scorpion stinging its own body.

Oh! my brother, have you never seen a good quality hurt and betray itself?

People have to overcome themselves: so you should love your good qualities, because they can also destroy you. This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (6) THE PALE CRIMINAL

You judges and sacrificers, do you plan to kill only after the animal has given up? Look, the pale criminal has bowed his head: his eyes show great disrespect.

"My ego is something I need to overcome: my ego is my biggest disappointment," his eyes say.

When he judged himself, that was his highest moment; don’t let him fall back into being low and weak!

There is no hope for someone who suffers from themselves unless they die quickly.

When you kill, judges, do it with pity, not revenge; and when you kill, make sure you are supporting life!

It’s not enough to just make peace with the one you kill.

Let your sadness be love for the next, better human: this will make your own life meaningful!

Say "enemy," not "villain," say "invalid," not "wretch," say "fool," not "sinner." And you, angry judge, if you said out loud all the bad things you think, everyone would shout: "Get rid of this nasty, dangerous creature!"

But thinking, doing, and the idea of doing are all different things.
