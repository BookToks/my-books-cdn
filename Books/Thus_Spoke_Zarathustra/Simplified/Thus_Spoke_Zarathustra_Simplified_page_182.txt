Oh, how could I not be excited about Forever, and about the ultimate ring—the ring that means coming back?

I have never found a girl I wanted to have kids with, except maybe the one I love: because I love you, Forever!

Because I love you, Forever!

If I ever made a peaceful world above me, and flew into my own sky with my own wings: If I played in deep shining spaces, and if my free bird-like wisdom came to me—then bird wisdom would say: "Look, there is no up or down! Throw yourself around, light one!

Sing! Don’t talk anymore!

Aren’t words made for heavy people? Don’t all words trick the light ones? Sing! Don’t talk anymore!"

Oh, how could I not be excited about Forever, and about the ultimate ring—the ring that means coming back?

I have never found a girl I wanted to have kids with, except maybe the one I love: because I love you, Forever!

Because I love you, Forever!
