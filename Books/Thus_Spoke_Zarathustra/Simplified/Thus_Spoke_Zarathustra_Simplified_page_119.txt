Doing great things is hard, but the harder job is to lead those great things.

This is your biggest stubbornness: you have the power, but you don’t want to be in charge. I said, "I don’t have the loud, strong voice to lead." Then I heard a quiet voice say, "It’s the softest words that start the biggest changes. Gentle thoughts quietly guide the world."

"O Zarathustra, you will be like a shadow of what’s coming. That’s how you will lead—by going first." I answered, "I feel ashamed." Then the voice said without speaking, "You need to become like a child and lose your shame."

"You still have the pride of being young, and you became young too late. But anyone who wants to be like a child must overcome even their youth." I thought about this for a long time and felt scared. But in the end, I said what I said before: "I won’t." Then everyone laughed around me. Oh, how painful that laughing was—it hurt deep inside me!

Then I heard one last time: "O Zarathustra, your fruits are ready, but you are not ready for your fruits! You must go back to being alone because you still need to grow."

Again there was laughter, but it faded away, and everything became very quiet. I lay on the ground, sweating all over.

Now you have heard everything and why I must be alone again.

I have told you nothing but the truth, my friends.

But even this is from me, who is still the most private man—and will always be!

Ah, my friends! I want to say more to you! I want to give you more! Why don’t I? Am I stingy? When Zarathustra said this, his pain became so strong and he felt like he was about to leave his friends, so he cried out loud. No one knew how to comfort him. That night, he left alone and went away from his friends.

"You look up when you want to feel important, but I look down because I already feel important.

Who among you can laugh and feel important at the same time?"
