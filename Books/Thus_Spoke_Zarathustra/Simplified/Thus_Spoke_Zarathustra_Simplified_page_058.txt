A snake bit Zarathustra on the neck, and he screamed because it hurt. When he moved his arm away from his face, he looked at the snake. The snake saw Zarathustra’s eyes, wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get away. "Not yet," said Zarathustra. "You haven’t earned my thanks! You woke me up just in time; I still have a long way to go." 

"Your journey is short," the snake said sadly. "My poison is deadly." Zarathustra smiled. "When did a dragon ever die from a snake’s poison?" he said. "Take your poison back! You’re not strong enough to give it to me." Then the snake bit him again on the neck and licked the wound.

When Zarathustra told this story to his followers, they asked, "What’s the lesson, Zarathustra?" He answered, "People who believe in good and right call me immoral because I destroy their idea of what’s good."

But if you have an enemy, don’t repay their bad actions with good ones—that would confuse them. Instead, show them they actually did something good for you.

It’s better to be angry than to embarrass someone! And if someone curses you, don’t feel like you have to bless them back. It’s okay to curse a little too.

If something really unfair happens to you, add a few smaller unfair things too. It’s ugly when someone suffers from only one big injustice.

Have you ever noticed? Shared unfairness feels less bad. And if you can handle it, take the unfairness on yourself.

A small revenge is more human than no revenge at all. But if punishing someone doesn’t also give them some respect, I don’t like it.

It’s nobler to admit when you’re wrong than to prove you’re right—especially if you really are right. But you have to be strong enough to do that.

I don’t like cold justice; behind every judge’s eyes, you can see the executioner with his cold sword.

Tell me: where can we find justice that is like love with open eyes?

Create for me a love that not only accepts all punishment but also all guilt!

Create for me a justice that forgives everyone except the judge!
