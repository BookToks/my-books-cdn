Around noon, when the sun was exactly above Zarathustra, he walked past an old, twisted tree covered by a vine full of yellow grapes. The grapes hung there in big bunches, inviting him.

He felt a bit thirsty and wanted to pick some grapes to eat. But just as he reached out his arm, he felt like doing something else instead – lying down under the tree and taking a nap in the middle of the day.

So Zarathustra did that. As soon as he lay down in the quiet grass, he forgot about being thirsty and fell asleep. For, as Zarathustra’s saying goes, “One thing is more important than the other.” But even while sleeping, his eyes stayed open because they loved looking at the tree and the vine.

As he fell asleep, Zarathustra whispered to his heart: “Be quiet! Isn’t the world perfect now? What’s happening to me?

Like a soft breeze moving over calm seas, sleep is dancing on me, light and gentle.

Sleep doesn’t close my eyes; it keeps my soul awake. It’s so light, truly gentle.

It makes me feel something I can’t explain. It touches me softly inside and makes me relax. Yes, it makes me relax so my soul can stretch out.

How tired and strange my soul feels! Is it already the evening of the seventh day at noon? Has it wandered too long, happily, among good and ripe things?

My strange soul stretches out, longer and longer, and then it lies still. It has already tasted too many good things; this golden sadness weighs on it and twists its mouth.

Like a ship that sails into the calmest bay, it now comes to shore, tired from long trips and rough seas.
