God is just an idea, but I don’t want you guessing about things you can’t actually create.

Can you make a God? If not, then please don’t talk about gods!

But you might be able to create the overman.

Maybe not you yourselves, my friends, but you could become the ancestors of the overman. That should be your greatest creation!

God is an idea, but I want your ideas to stay about things you can actually imagine.

Can you imagine a God? For you, that should mean wanting the truth, so everything can be understood by humans — seen, felt, and known by us! Follow your own understanding all the way.

What you call the world will be something you create: your reason, your image, your will, your love — they will all come from you! And that will bring you happiness, you who think deeply!

How would you live without hope like that, you who think deeply? You couldn’t have been born in something you can’t imagine or something that doesn’t make sense.

To be honest with you, my friends: if there were gods, I couldn’t handle there being no God! So, I believe there are no gods.

Yes, I’ve made up my mind; but now that idea challenges me. God is just an idea — but who could handle all the pain that comes with believing that without breaking down? Should the creative person lose their faith, and the eagle lose its high flight?

God is a thought — it turns everything straight into something twisted, and makes everything that stands strong start to shake. What? Time would disappear, and everything that changes would just be a lie?

Thinking this makes people dizzy, sick, even throw up: I call it the sickness of trying to believe something like that.

I think it’s harmful and hates people: all that teaching about being one, being full, unmoving, perfect, and unchanging!

All things that never change — that’s just a comparison, and poets lie a lot. But the best comparisons are about time and change: they praise and explain why things must end!

Creating is the great way to save yourself from pain and make life better. But for a creator to exist, there must be suffering and a lot of change.
