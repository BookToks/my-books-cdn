But you, be careful not to feel too sorry for others! Many people are coming to you—they are hurting, confused, hopeless, drowning, and cold. I warn you about myself too. You have seen the best and worst parts of me, and what I have done. I know the danger that can hurt you.

But he had to die: he saw everything with his eyes—he saw the deepest, darkest, and ugliest parts of people.

His pity was not shy: he went into my dirtiest places. This nosy, too-pittying person had to die.

He always watched me: I needed to get back at such a witness—or I couldn’t live.

The God who saw everything and also saw humans: that God had to die!

"You, unsure one," he said, "you warned me about your path. As thanks, I will praise mine to you. Look, up there is Zarathustra’s cave.

My cave is big and deep with many corners; there, anyone who is most hidden can hide. And right next to it, there are hundreds of places for small creatures to sneak, flutter, and hop.

You, outcast who threw yourself out, don’t want to live with people and their pity? Then do like me! That’s how you will learn from me; only people who act learn.

“How poor people really are,” he thought inside, “how ugly, weak, and full of secret shame!

They say people love themselves. Wow, that must be a big love! But there is so much hate against it!

Even this man has loved himself and hated himself too—I think he is a great lover and a great hater.

I haven’t found anyone who hated themselves more than this man; even that is something special.
