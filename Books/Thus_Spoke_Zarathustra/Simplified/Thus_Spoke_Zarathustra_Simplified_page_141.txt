The moon has its court, and the court has its moon-calves: all the people who beg from the court pray to it, and all the virtues that can be chosen serve it.

"I serve, you serve, we serve" – this is how every good quality prays to the prince, hoping that the shining star will finally stick on his thin chest!

But the moon still goes around everything on earth; just like the prince goes around the most earthly thing of all – the gold of the shopkeeper.

The god of war is not the god of money; the prince makes plans, but the shopkeeper decides!

By everything bright, strong, and good in you, Zarathustra! Spit on this city of shopkeepers and go back!

Here, all the blood flows weakly and dirty in everyone’s veins. Spit on this big city, which is like a dirty slum where all the bad stuff mixes together!

Spit on the city full of trapped souls and skinny chests, with sharp eyes and sticky fingers – the city of rude, bold-faced people, fake leaders, and loud talkers, full of greedy and sneaky people who are sick and dangerous.

Spit on this big city and go back! But Zarathustra stopped the angry fool and shut his mouth.

"Stop right now!" Zarathustra said. "Your words and your kind have annoyed me for a long time!

Why did you live so long in the swamp that you had to become a frog or a toad?

Don’t you have dirty, weak blood in your veins too, since you learned to croak and insult like that?

Why didn’t you go into the forest? Or why didn’t you work the land? Aren’t there green islands in the sea?

I hate your hate; and if you warned me, why didn’t you warn yourself?

My hate and my warning come only from love, not from the swamp!

They call you my ape, you angry fool; but I call you my grunting pig – your grunts even ruin my silly praise.

Why did you start to grunt like that? Because nobody praised you enough – so you sat beside this filth to have a reason to grunt and get revenge!"
