Really, to this kind of spirit, it feels like stealing and acting like a wild animal.

It used to love the idea of "You Shall" as something very important. Now it has to see even the most sacred things as fake or random, so it can break free from that love. The lion is needed to do this.

But tell me, my friends, what can a child do that even a lion can’t? Why does the fierce lion have to become a child too?

Innocence is like a child, forgetting the past, starting fresh, playing, moving on, and saying a sacred yes to life.

To create and live fully, my friends, you need to say a true “yes” to life: the spirit now wants its own will; the one who lost the world now makes their own world.

I told you about three changes of the spirit: how it became a camel, then a lion, and finally a child. That’s what Zarathustra said. And he was in a town called The Motley Cow.

Part 1, (2) THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE

People told Zarathustra about a wise man who was really good at talking about sleep and being good. He was respected and rewarded a lot, and all the young people sat in front of him.

Zarathustra went and sat with the youths. The wise man said: Be respectful and shy when it comes to sleep! That’s the most important thing!

And stay away from people who sleep badly and stay awake at night!

Even a thief is shy around sleep: he sneaks quietly through the night. But the night-watchman is shameless; he blows his horn without care.

Sleeping well is not easy: to do it, you have to stay awake and active all day.

You have to overcome yourself ten times every day: that makes you tired in a good way and feels like medicine for your soul.

You also have to make peace with yourself ten times a day; overcoming yourself can be hard, and if you don’t make peace, you’ll sleep badly.

You need to find ten truths during the day; if not, you’ll look for truth at night, and your soul will stay hungry.
