Leave me alone! I’m too pure for you. Don’t touch me!

Isn’t my world perfect right now?

My skin is too pure for your hands. Go away, boring, stupid day! Isn’t midnight brighter?

The purest people are the strongest and the smartest. They are like the midnight souls, brighter and deeper than daytime.

Oh day, are you looking for me? Are you trying to find my happiness? Do I seem rich, lonely, or full of treasure to you?

Oh world, do you want me? Am I worldly enough for you? Am I spiritual enough for you?

Am I godly for you? But day and world, you are too rough. Use smarter hands to reach for deeper happiness or deeper sadness, reach for some God; don’t reach for me. My sadness and happiness are deep, strange day, but I am not God or a god’s hell. My pain is deep.

God’s pain is even deeper, strange world! Reach for God’s pain, not mine! What am I? A drunken, sweet lyre—a midnight lyre, a weird frog that no one understands, but still has to speak to those who can’t hear, you important people! Because you don’t understand me!

Gone! Gone! Oh youth! Oh noon! Oh afternoon! Now evening, night, and midnight have come—the dog howls, the wind blows—isn’t the wind like a dog? It whines, barks, and howls. Ah! How she sighs! How she laughs! How she breathes hard, the midnight!

How she just now speaks clearly, this drunken poet! Has she maybe drunk too much? Has she become too awake? Is she thinking deeply?

She thinks about her pain in a dream, the old, deep midnight, and also her joy. Because even though pain is deep, joy is even deeper than grief.

You grapevine! Why do you praise me? Didn’t I cut you? I’m cruel, and you bleed—why do you praise my drunken cruelty?

“Young things want to die when they’re perfect and mature!” you say. Blessed be the vintner’s knife! But everything that’s not mature wants to live: alas.

Pain says, “Go away, you pain!” But everything that suffers wants to live so it can grow strong and full of longing—for more, for better, for brighter. “I want children,” says everything that suffers, “I don’t want just myself.” But joy doesn’t want children or heirs; joy wants itself, it wants forever, it wants to keep coming back, it wants everything to be forever like itself.
