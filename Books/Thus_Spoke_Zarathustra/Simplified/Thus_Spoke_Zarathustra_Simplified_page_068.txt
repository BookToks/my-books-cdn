Didn’t a child come to me, holding a mirror?

“O Zarathustra,” the child said, “look at yourself in the mirror!” But when I looked, I screamed and my heart pounded: I didn’t see myself, but a scary devil’s face laughing at me.

I understand the warning of this dream very well: my teachings are in danger; bad things want to be called good!

My enemies have become strong and twisted my teachings, so my closest friends feel embarrassed by the gifts I gave them.

My friends are lost; it’s time for me to find them again! Zarathustra stood up, but not like someone in pain looking for help—instead, like someone inspired and full of hope. His eagle and serpent looked at him with surprise: happiness was shining on his face like a bright morning.

“What’s happening to me, my animals?” Zarathustra said. “Am I changing? Has happiness come to me like a fast wind?”

My happiness is silly, and it will say silly things: it’s still young—so be patient with it!

My happiness hurts me: all those who suffer will help heal me!

I can go back to my friends and even my enemies! Zarathustra can speak and give again, and show his greatest love to those he cares about!

My love is too eager and overflows like rivers—flowing toward sunrise and sunset. From quiet mountains and hard times, my soul rushes into the valleys.

I have waited and looked far away for too long. I have been alone for too long: that’s why I forgot how to stay quiet.

I have become all about speaking, like a noisy stream falling down rocks: I will throw my words down into the valleys.

And let my love flow into places no one visits! How can a stream not finally reach the sea?

I do have a quiet lake inside me, calm and enough for itself; but the stream of my love carries it along, down to the sea!

I am walking new paths, new words come to me; I’m tired like all creators of old languages. My spirit won’t walk on old, worn-out shoes anymore.

All speaking goes too slow for me—into your chariot, O storm, I leap!
