Surprised and pale, it stands there - right before the pink sunrise!

Because she’s coming already, the glowing one - bringing her love to the earth!

Innocence and creative desire make up the sun’s love!

Look, she’s coming quickly over the sea! Can’t you feel her love’s hot breath and thirst?

At the sea, she would drink deeply from its depths to grow tall: now the sea’s desire rises with its many waves.

The sun’s thirst would kiss and drink it; the sea would turn into vapor, rise up, become a path of light, and become light itself!

I truly love life and all the deep seas, just like the sun does.

And this is what I understand: everything deep must rise up to my height! That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 2, (16) SCHOLARS

When I was asleep, a sheep ate the ivy wreath on my head - and it said, “Zarathustra is no longer a scholar.” Then it walked away, clumsy and proud. A child told me this.

I like to lie here where the children play, beside the broken wall, among thistles and red poppies.

To the children, and even to the thistles and poppies, I am still a scholar. They are innocent, even when they seem bad.

But to the sheep, I am no longer a scholar - so I wish my luck to it!

Because this is true: I have left the scholars’ house, and slammed the door behind me.

My soul sat hungry too long at their table: but unlike them, I don’t have the skill for studying like cracking nuts.

I love freedom and fresh air; I’d rather sleep on animal skins than on their honors and titles.

My thoughts burn too hot inside me: sometimes they almost take my breath away. Then I have to go outside, away from all dusty rooms.

But they sit cool in the shade: they want to only watch everything, and avoid sitting where the sun burns on the steps.

Like people standing on the street staring at others walking by: that’s how they wait and stare at the thoughts others have already had.
