Hey guys, am I being mean? But I say: when something falls, someone else will push it down too!

Everything today is falling apart and breaking down; who would want to keep it safe? But I want to push it down too!

Do you know how fun it is to roll stones down steep cliffs? People today, watch how they roll into my depths!

I’m just a warm-up for better people, my friends! An example! Follow my example!

And those you don’t teach to fly, please teach them to fall faster!

I like brave people, but it’s not enough to just be good with a sword—you have to know when to use it!

Sometimes it’s braver to stay quiet and walk away, so you can save your strength for a bigger fight!

You should only have enemies you hate, not enemies you look down on; be proud of your enemies. I’ve already taught this.

Save yourself for better enemies, my friends; so pass by many, especially the noisy crowd who talk a lot about people and nations.

Don’t get caught up in their arguments for and against! There’s some truth and some lies, and if you watch too much, you’ll get angry.

Watching and fighting are the same thing here; so go to the forest and let your sword rest!

Go your own way! Let the people and nations go theirs! Their paths are dark, with no hope shining anymore!

Let the traders rule where only their gold still shines. It’s not the time for kings anymore: what calls itself the people now doesn’t deserve kings.

See how these people act just like traders: they grab every little advantage from all kinds of trash!

They set tricks for each other and take things from each other, and call it "good neighborliness."
