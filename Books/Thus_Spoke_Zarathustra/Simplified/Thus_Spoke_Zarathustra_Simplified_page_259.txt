In August, he likes a married woman from Paris named Louise Ott, but he doesn’t want to start a love affair with her.  

In October, he leaves with his new Jewish friend and scholar, Paul Ree, to join Albert Brenner and Malwida von Meysenbug. They live together as "free spirits" in a villa in Sorrento, Italy. On the way, he stops to visit Pisa with Isabella von Pahlen, a girl he met on the train.  

In November, Nietzsche meets Wagner for the last time in Sorrento.  

In January, the Sorrento group spends their days walking, reading, and working on their own projects. They talk a lot about Nietzsche and who he should marry, thinking marriage might help with his illness.  

In early October, doctors tell him to stop reading and writing completely for many years to help his eye problem.  

In March, he is allowed to stop teaching at high school.  

In May, his book "Human, All Too Human" is published. Wagner criticizes it, saying it has Jewish ideas. Nietzsche jokes with Ree that everyone thinks Ree wrote the book, and he congratulates him.  

In autumn, Nietzsche’s illness gets worse, and teaching makes him very tired.  

In March, another book, "Mixed Opinions and Maxims," comes out, but it doesn’t sell well.  

In May, Nietzsche quits the university because of his health. In June, the university thanks him and gives him a pension of two-thirds of his salary. His friends try to find ways to help him with money. He sells his furniture and stores his books in Zurich.  

In August and September, even though he’s sick, he keeps writing short ideas for his next book. His new friend, Peter Gast, helps him.  

About being a respected professor at the University of Basel, he says that for ten years he didn’t really grow or learn much and forgot a lot while doing boring scholarly work.  

In December, his book "The Wanderer and His Shadow" is published.
