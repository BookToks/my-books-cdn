There have to be some slow and awkward people so that the quick and skilled ones can stand out.

It was there that I found the word "overman," which means a person who must be bettered and passed.

This overman is like a bridge, not the final goal. We should enjoy the good times but always keep moving toward new, better beginnings. This is what Zarathustra taught at the highest point of life, and I have shared these ideas like beautiful purple sunsets.

I showed people new stars to look at and new nights to explore. I spread laughter over clouds, days, and nights like a colorful roof.

I taught them how to bring together all the broken parts of a person, the mysteries, and the scary chances in life. Like a composer or puzzle solver, I taught them to create the future and make sense of the past by creating something new.

I told them to fix the past and change every "It was" until their own will says, "Yes, this is what I wanted! This is what I will want!" This is what I called redemption, and it’s the only kind of redemption I taught.

Now I wait for my own redemption so I can visit people one last time.

I will go back to them once more; my sun will set among them, and in my dying, I will give them my best gift.

I learned from the sun that when it sets, it pours gold into the sea endlessly, so even the poorest fisherman rows with golden oars! I saw this once and cried because it was so beautiful. Like the sun, Zarathustra will also set. Now he sits here, surrounded by old broken tables and new half-written ones.

Look, here is a new table. But where are my friends who will help me carry it to the valley and into people's hearts? My great love asks even strangers to be bold and not just care about their neighbors. People are meant to be surpassed.

There are many different ways to be better. You should figure out your own!

Only a fool thinks, "Man can’t be bettered."
