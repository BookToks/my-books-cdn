Just admit it! Not much happened when your noise and smoke disappeared. What if a city became like a mummy, and a statue was lying in the mud?

And this is what I say to those who knock down statues: It’s really stupid to throw salt into the sea or statues into the mud.

The statue lay in the mud because of your disrespect, but that’s how it works – from hate, its life and beauty grow back again!

Now it rises again with even more amazing features, winning people over with its suffering; and honestly, it will thank you for knocking it down, you troublemakers!

But this advice is for kings and churches, and anyone weak with age or goodness – let yourselves be knocked down! So you can come back to life again, and so goodness can come back to you!

I said this while talking to the fire-dog, but he interrupted me angrily and asked, “Church? What’s that?” I answered, “Church? That’s a kind of government, and the most dishonest one. But be quiet, you tricky dog! You know your own kind best!

Like you, the government is a tricky dog; like you, it likes to speak with smoke and loud noises – pretending, like you, that it speaks from the truth.

It tries by any means to be the most important thing on earth, the government; and people believe it is.” When I said this, the fire-dog acted like he was mad with jealousy. “What!” he shouted, “The most important thing on earth? And people think so?” He made so much noise and smoke from his throat that I thought he’d choke with anger and jealousy.

Finally, he calmed down and stopped panting. As soon as he was quiet, I laughed and said, “You’re angry, fire-dog, so I must be right about you!

And to prove I’m right, listen to the story of another fire-dog; he truly speaks from the heart of the earth.

Gold is in his breath, and golden rain; that’s what his heart wants.

What are ashes, smoke, and hot leftovers to him?

Laughter floats from him like a colorful cloud; he hates your coughing, spitting, and stomach pains!

But gold and laughter – these come from the heart of the earth. So you should know – the heart of the earth is made of gold.”

When the fire-dog heard this, he couldn’t stand to listen to me anymore.
