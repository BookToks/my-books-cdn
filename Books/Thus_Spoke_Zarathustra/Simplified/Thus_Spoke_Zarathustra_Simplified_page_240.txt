Lost it!

Huff! Huff! Huff! Huff! Huff!

It’s gone!

Gone forever!

The other leg!

Oh, poor, beautiful other leg!

Where could it be now, all alone and crying?

The loneliest leg?

Maybe it’s scared of a fierce, yellow, blond, curly lion monster? Or maybe it’s been chewed on badly—so sad, so awful! Chewed up badly! Pause.

Oh, don’t cry, gentle spirits!

Don’t cry, you sweet date-fruit spirits! Milk-filled ones!

You soft-hearted little purses!

Don’t cry anymore, pale Dudu!

Be strong, Suleika! Brave! Brave!

Or maybe there’s something here that can make you stronger?

Some inspiring words?

Some serious advice?

Come on! Honor!

Moral honor! European honor!

Blow again, keep going, bellows of virtue!

Ha!

Roar once more,

Your moral roar!

Like a good lion roaring near desert girls!

Because the roar of virtue, dear girls, is stronger than any European passion or hunger!
