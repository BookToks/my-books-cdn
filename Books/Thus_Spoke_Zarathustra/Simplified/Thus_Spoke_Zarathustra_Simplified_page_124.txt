When the sailors found out that Zarathustra was on the ship – because a man from the Happy Isles had come with him – they became very curious and excited. But Zarathustra stayed quiet for two days and seemed sad and cold. He didn’t answer anyone’s questions or looks.  

On the evening of the second day, he started listening again, but he still didn’t speak. There were many strange and risky stories on the ship, which had come from far away and was going even further.  

Zarathustra liked people who traveled far and didn’t want to live without danger. Finally, as he listened, he began to speak, and the coldness in his heart melted. He said: To you, the brave travelers and adventurers, and everyone who sails across scary seas, to you who love mysteries and the unknown, whose souls are drawn to danger like music calling you to risky places –  

To you, who hate guessing blindly and don’t like to just calculate when you can sense something deeper – I will share the mystery I saw, the vision of the loneliest one. Recently, I walked sadly in a dark twilight, feeling gloomy and serious, with tight lips. More than one sun had set for me.  

I followed a difficult path climbing over big rocks, a lonely and harsh path where no plants grew, a mountain path that cracked under my bold steps.  

I walked silently, stepping over sharp stones that slipped under my feet, forcing my way upward.  

Upwards – even though my spirit wanted to pull me down toward the deep, the spirit of gravity, my enemy.  

Upwards – even though it weighed on me, like a half-dwarf, half-mole, paralyzing me, pouring heavy thoughts into my brain.  

“O Zarathustra,” it whispered mockingly, word by word, “you stone of wisdom! You threw yourself high, but every stone that’s thrown must fall!”  

“O Zarathustra, you stone of wisdom, you sling-stone, you star-destroyer!”
