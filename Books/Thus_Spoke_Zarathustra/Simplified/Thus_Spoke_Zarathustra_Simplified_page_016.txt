I like people who say nice things but do even more than they promise because they are ready to fall.

I like people who stand up for future generations and make up for past mistakes because they are ready to be judged by the present.

I like people who challenge their God because they love their God, even if it means facing their God’s anger.

I like people whose soul is strong even when hurt and who don’t give up easily—they happily face danger.

I like people whose soul is so full that they forget themselves and feel connected to everything, even when things go wrong.

I like people who have a free spirit and a free heart; their heart leads them even when it means going down.

I like everyone who is like heavy raindrops falling from a dark cloud over humans; they warn of the coming lightning and disappear as messengers.

Look, I am a messenger of the lightning, a heavy raindrop from the cloud; the lightning is called the overman.

I will talk to them about the most shameful thing: the last man!" And Zarathustra said to the people: It’s time for humans to set a goal for themselves.
