My soul is like a fountain that won’t stop flowing.

It’s night now, the time when all love songs come alive. My soul is like a love song too.

There’s something inside me that can’t be satisfied; it wants to be heard. I have a strong need for love, and it speaks the language of love.

I feel light, but I wish I were night. It’s lonely to be surrounded by light!

I wish I were dark and night because then I could drink in the light like it’s food.

And I would bless you, little stars and glowing bugs up high! I would be happy because of your light.

But I live in my own light, drinking in the flames that come from me.

I don’t know what it feels like to receive happiness. Sometimes I dream that taking is better than getting.

It’s sad that my hand never stops giving; I’m jealous when I see eyes waiting and nights filled with longing.

Oh, the pain of always giving! Oh, my sun getting dim! Oh, the need to need! Oh, the hunger that comes even when I’m full!

They take from me, but do I really reach their soul? There’s a space between giving and receiving, and even the smallest space must be closed.

My beauty makes me hungry: I want to hurt those I light up; I want to steal from those I have given to—that’s how I hunger to be bad.

I pull back my hand when someone else reaches for it; I hesitate like a waterfall that’s scared to fall—that’s how I hunger to be bad!

This is how my abundance thinks about revenge; such bad ideas come from my loneliness.

My joy in giving died while giving; my goodness got tired of itself because it gave too much!

Anyone who always gives risks losing their shame; their hand and heart get hard from giving all the time.

My eyes don’t fill with tears for people asking anymore; my hand is too tough to feel the trembling of hands that are full.

Where have the tears gone from my eyes and the softness from my heart? Oh, the loneliness of always giving! Oh, the silence of all who shine!

Many suns move through empty space: they speak with their light to all that is dark—but to me, they stay silent.
