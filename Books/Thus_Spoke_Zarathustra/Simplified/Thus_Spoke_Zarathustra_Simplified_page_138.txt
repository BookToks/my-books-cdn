Even when I quietly get into bed, my hidden happiness still laughs and plays inside me; even my tricky dreams laugh too.

Am I someone who sneaks around? Never in my life have I sneaked in front of powerful people; and if I ever lied, it was only because of love. That’s why I’m happy even when I’m lying in my cold bed.

A simple, poor bed feels warmer to me than a fancy one because I care about my poverty. In winter, my bed feels the most loyal to me.

I start every day with a bit of mischief: I challenge the cold winter by taking a cold bath, which annoys my strict roommate.

I also like to tease him with a candle, hoping he will finally let the bright sky come out of the dull grey morning.

I’m especially naughty in the morning, when the water bucket clinks at the well and horses softly neigh in the grey streets. I can’t wait for the clear sky to appear—the snowy, old winter sky that often hides its sun!

Did I learn how to be quiet and calm from the winter sky? Or did it learn from me? Or did we both just come up with it?

All good things come from many different places—fun and mischievous things happen over and over because they bring joy.

Being quietly clever is one of these fun things, like the long silence and looking out like the winter sky with bright, round eyes—sometimes hiding your own bright sun and strong will. I’ve learned this trick and this winter mischief well!

My favorite trick is that my silence doesn’t give away what I’m really thinking.

I talk and play games with words to fool the serious people around me; all those strict watchers won’t understand my true plans.

I made this long, clear silence so no one can see deep inside me or guess my real intentions.

I’ve met many clever people who hide their faces and make their water muddy so no one can see through them.

But even those people get outsmarted by others who are even more suspicious and clever, who find their hidden secrets!

For me, the wisest silent people are the clear, honest, and open ones: their depth is so deep that even the clearest water can’t reveal what’s inside.
