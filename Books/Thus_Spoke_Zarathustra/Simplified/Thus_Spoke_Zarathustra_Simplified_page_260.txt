His friends like the book, but only 192 copies are sold.

From March to June, with help from Gast, Nietzsche moves to live in Venice.

Gast reads to him and writes down what Nietzsche says since he is sick in bed.

On February 36, The Dawn is finished.

In July, The Dawn is published. Nietzsche goes to Sils Maria, high in the Swiss Alps. While there, he thinks of the idea for Zarathustra.

From January to March, some parts meant for The Dawn are changed into The Gay Science.

He tries using a typewriter, which was invented only 10 years before, but it doesn’t help him write better, so he stops using it.

In March, Nietzsche takes a ship to Messina, which he likes, but after four weeks, he goes to Rome.

In May, Nietzsche meets Lou Salome in Rome. She might be the only woman he feels strongly about. Lou is young and loves adventure. Lou, Ree, and Nietzsche talk and dream about living and studying together in Paris. Lou later says Nietzsche asked her to marry him twice, but recent experts don’t think that really happened. Ree also likes Lou, and with Nietzsche’s jealous and strict sister Elizabeth, things get really messy emotionally.

In August, The Gay Science is published. Lou and Elizabeth have a loud, angry fight, but Nietzsche doesn’t know about it. Lou gives Nietzsche a beautiful poem she wrote, and he likes it so much that he sets it to music and later publishes it.

In September, they plan for the “trinity” to go to Paris, but at the last minute, everything falls apart. Nietzsche’s mother, influenced by Elizabeth, hates Lou. Nietzsche finds out about the hatred between Lou and Elizabeth.

In October, the “trinity” meets for the last time. By November, Nietzsche is definitely not going to Paris.

In November, Nietzsche spends a hard month alone in Rapallo.

Through letters, his relationships with Ree and Lou get worse. He is so upset with his mother and sister that he won’t even write to them. At Christmas, he writes to his friend Overbeck, “This last bite of life was the hardest I’ve ever chewed…” 

In January, Nietzsche has good and bad days. When he feels good, he finishes a clean copy of the first part of Zarathustra in just ten days.

In February, Wagner dies. Nietzsche writes to a friend, “It was hard, very hard, for six years to be against someone I have loved and respected as much as Wagner.”

From late February to May, Nietzsche feels happy and his health gets better.
