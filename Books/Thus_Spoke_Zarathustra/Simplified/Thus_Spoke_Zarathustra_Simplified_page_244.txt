At this part, Zarathustra couldn’t hold back anymore; he shouted YE-A even louder than the donkey and jumped into the middle of his wild guests. "What are you doing, you grown-up kids?" he said, helping the praying people stand up. "If anyone else saw you, they’d think you’re the worst blasphemers or the silliest old women with your new belief!

And you, old pope, how can you worship a donkey like it’s God?" "Oh Zarathustra," the pope said, "forgive me, but I understand divine things better than you. And that’s how it should be.

It’s better to worship God like this, in some form, than not at all! Think about that, my friend: there’s real wisdom in this.

The person who said ‘God is a Spirit’ took the biggest step toward unbelief ever made on earth. That idea is hard to fix!

My old heart is happy because there’s still something to worship on earth. Forgive me, Zarathustra, for being an old, pious pope!"—

"And you," Zarathustra said to the wanderer and shadow, "you call yourself a free spirit? And here you are practicing idol worship?

You’re worse than your bad brown girls, you bad new believer!" "It’s sad," the wanderer said, "you’re right. But what can I do? The old God is alive again, Zarathustra, no matter what you say.

The ugliest man is to blame for this: he brought God back. And if he says he killed God once, that’s just a silly idea."—

"And you," Zarathustra said to the old magician, "what did you do? Who would believe in you anymore in these free times if you believe in this donkey worship?

It was dumb of you; how could you, a smart man, do something so stupid?" "Oh Zarathustra," the magician said, "you’re right, it was dumb and it even disgusted me."—

"And you too," Zarathustra said to the serious one, "and you don’t feel bad about this at all?"
