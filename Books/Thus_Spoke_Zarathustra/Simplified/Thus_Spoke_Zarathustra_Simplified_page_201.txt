But the devil is never where he’s supposed to be: he always shows up too late, that annoying little guy with a limp!” Zarathustra thought angrily and tried to figure out how to quietly sneak past the dark man without being noticed. But things didn’t go as planned.

At the exact same moment, the man sitting down saw him. Like someone surprised by good news, he jumped up and walked straight toward Zarathustra.

“Whoever you are, traveler,” he said, “please help me, an old man who’s lost and looking for something. It’s easy to get hurt here!

This place feels strange and far away. I even heard wild animals howling. The one who could have protected me is gone.

I was looking for a holy man, a saint who lives alone in the forest and hasn’t heard what everyone else knows now.” 

“What does everyone know now?” asked Zarathustra.

“Maybe that the old God, whom everyone used to believe in, is no longer alive?” the old man said sadly. “That’s right,” he added. “I served that old God until the very end.

Now, I have no one to serve, but I’m not free either. I’m not even happy anymore, except when I remember the past.

That’s why I came up into these mountains—to have one last celebration for myself, like an old pope and church leader should: a celebration of holy memories and prayers.

But now even the most holy man, the saint in the forest who always sang and prayed to his God, is dead.

When I found his little hut, the saint wasn’t there, but two wolves were howling because he died—because all animals loved him. So I left quickly.

Was my trip to these forests and mountains useless? Then I decided to look for someone else, the most faithful of all who don’t believe in God—my heart told me to find Zarathustra!” 

The old man said this and looked closely at Zarathustra. Zarathustra grabbed the old pope’s hand and looked at it with respect for a long time.
