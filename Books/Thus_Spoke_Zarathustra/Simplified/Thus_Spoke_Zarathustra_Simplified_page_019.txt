After some time, the broken man woke up and saw Zarathustra kneeling next to him. "Why are you here?" he asked finally. "I always knew the devil would trick me. Now he’s dragging me to hell. Will you stop him?" Zarathustra answered, "I promise, friend, there is no devil and no hell. Your soul will die even before your body, so don’t be afraid anymore!" The man looked at him suspiciously. "If you’re telling the truth," he said, "then I have nothing to lose when I die. I’m just like an animal trained to survive with pain and little food." Zarathustra said, "No, you chose danger as your path, and there’s nothing shameful about that. Now you die because of it, so I will bury you myself." The dying man didn’t say anything else but moved his hand like he wanted to hold Zarathustra’s in thanks.

Evening came, and the market square grew dark. People left because even curiosity and fear get tired. But Zarathustra stayed beside the dead man, lost in thought and forgetting the time. Finally, night fell and a cold wind blew. Zarathustra stood up and said to himself, "Today I caught something special—not a man, but a corpse."

Human life is strange and still feels meaningless. Sometimes a fool can control someone’s fate.

I want to teach people the meaning of life, which is to become the overman, like lightning breaking through dark clouds.

But I am still far from them, and they can’t understand what I feel.

To most people, I seem like a fool or a dead man.

The night is dark, and Zarathustra’s path is dark too. Come, cold and stiff friend! I will carry you to the place where I will bury you myself.

After saying this, Zarathustra put the dead man on his shoulders and started walking.
