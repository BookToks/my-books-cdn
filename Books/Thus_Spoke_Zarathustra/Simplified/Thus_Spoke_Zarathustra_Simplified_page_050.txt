When it comes to understanding and staying quiet, your friend should be the expert: you don’t need to know everything. Your dreams will show you what your friend does when they’re awake.

Let your kindness be a way to understand if your friend even wants your pity. Maybe they like the calm and steady way you look at things.

Keep your kindness for your friend hidden beneath a tough outside; it might be hard to get through, but it will be special and sweet.

Are you like fresh air, quiet time, food, and medicine for your friend?

A lot of people can’t free themselves, but they still help their friends become free.

If you’re a slave, you can’t really be a friend. If you’re a bossy person, you can’t have real friends.

For too long, there have been slaves and bosses hidden inside women.

Because of that, women aren’t ready for true friendship yet; they only know love.

Women’s love can be unfair and blind to what they don’t love. Even when a woman is fully aware of her love, it still has surprises, strong feelings, and darkness mixed with light.

Women aren’t ready for friendship yet. They’re still like cats and birds. Or at best, like cows.

Women are not ready for friendship yet. But tell me, guys, who of you can really be a friend?

Oh! You guys are so poor and mean inside! Whatever you give to your friend, I’ll give the same even to someone I don’t like, and I won’t be poorer for it.

There is being buddies: let there be true friendship!

That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (15) THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS

Zarathustra traveled to many lands and met many people. He learned what was good and bad about them.

No power on earth was bigger than what people thought was good or bad.

No group can live without deciding what is good. But if a group wants to survive, it can’t just copy what others think is good.

A lot of things that one group thought were good, another group thought were silly or bad—that’s what I found.
