"Look," said the old helmsman, "there goes Zarathustra to hell!" Around the same time the sailors reached the fire-isle, people started saying Zarathustra had disappeared. When his friends were asked, they said he sneaked onto a ship at night without telling anyone where he was going.

This made people worried. After three days, a story came from the ship’s crew, which made everyone say the devil had taken Zarathustra. His followers laughed at this and one even said, "I’d sooner believe Zarathustra took the devil." But deep down, they were all anxious and hoping for him. So, they were very happy when Zarathustra showed up on the fifth day.

Here is what Zarathustra said about his meeting with the fire-dog: The earth is like skin, and this skin has illnesses. One illness is called "man." Another is called "the fire-dog." People have misunderstood this fire-dog and have been fooled about it.

To figure this out, I crossed the sea and saw the truth clearly, standing barefoot up to my neck in it.

Now I understand the fire-dog and all the noisy, troublemaking devils that even old women fear.

"Come out, fire-dog, and tell me how deep your home is! Where do you get what you blow out?

You drink a lot from the sea—that’s why your words are so bitter! But really, for a dog of the deep, you feed too much from the surface!

At best, I think you’re just the earth’s ventriloquist: whenever I hear noisy, rebellious devils talk, they’re like you—bitter, lying, and shallow.

You know how to roar and cover things with smoke! You’re great at bragging and stirring up trouble.

Where you are, there are always bad things and lots of empty, hollow stuff wanting freedom.

You all shout for “freedom” the loudest, but I’ve stopped believing in “big events” when there’s lots of noise and smoke.

Believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The biggest events aren’t the loudest ones, but the quietest moments.

The world doesn’t spin around noisy inventors of new sounds; it spins quietly around those who create new values.
