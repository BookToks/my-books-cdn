There is nothing wrong or unhealthy about wanting and reaching down.

The lonely mountain top shouldn't stay alone forever; the mountains should come down to the valleys, and the high winds should reach the plains. Who could even name this kind of deep longing? Zarathustra once called it "bestowing virtue," a name for something hard to describe.

Then something new happened for the first time! Zarathustra said that selfishness can be good—healthy selfishness that comes from a strong soul.

A strong soul belongs to a strong body—the body that looks good, feels proud, and is full of energy. This body is flexible and convincing, like a dancer, and it shows a soul that enjoys itself. This kind of self-enjoyment calls itself "virtue." It protects itself with ideas of right and wrong, and it uses the words for happiness to push away anything weak or shameful.

It pushes away anything cowardly and says, "Cowardly is bad!" It looks down on people who are always worried, complaining, or trying to get small advantages.

It also dislikes sad, gloomy wisdom that says "nothing matters." It thinks being shy and suspicious is weak, and it doesn’t like people who want promises instead of honest looks and actions. It sees too much doubt as something only scared souls do.

Even worse, it hates people who are too eager to please, who lie down and obey right away. There is also a kind of wisdom that is weak, obedient, and overly respectful.

It really hates people who never stand up for themselves, who take insults and bad treatment without fighting back—the ones who are too patient, too tolerant, and too satisfied. That’s what slaves are like.

Whether they obey gods or people, this healthy selfishness hates all kinds of slaves!

It calls weak, broken spirits bad, and it hates the fake, cowardly way some people act, with their scared eyes, sad hearts, and fake kindness that only shows fear.
