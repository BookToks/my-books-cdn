I don’t try hard to make him fit into simpler or more normal ideas. I don’t compare him to other easier philosophies. If a sentence or saying doesn’t “make sense” to me, I just ignore it and hope my brain figures it out later. But, except for some parts of Zarathustra, Nietzsche usually writes clearly and uses simple words. He didn’t just come up with new ideas, he created a new way to live life. I’d call him a “life experimenter.”

I almost never read books about Nietzsche’s philosophy. They are usually boring, and you end up learning more about the authors than about Nietzsche himself.

Part of Nietzsche’s genius was simple: He took the most popular and important “truths” of his time, flipped them upside down, shook them up a bit, and enjoyed all the interesting ideas that came out.

His Best 8 Books  
1. I think Nietzsche’s best book is The Gay Science (1881). When he wrote it, he was free from university life and felt happy. Besides being fun to read, this book is like training your spirit to dance.

2. His autobiography, Ecce Homo (1888), is next. Here, we see how “lazy” he was as an overman-type: “I am the opposite of a heroic nature. To ‘will’ something, to ‘strive’ after something, to have an ‘aim’ or a ‘desire’ in my mind – I don’t know these from experience.” At his peak, this book is full of smart ideas, humor, and practical wisdom. Walter Kaufmann said, “Who wouldn’t want Shakespeare talking about Shakespeare, instead of thousands of critics guessing what he meant?”

3. Zarathustra (1882-85) finishes what I think are Nietzsche’s three best books. Nietzsche believed this book was better than all his others. Of its four parts, the first two are the easiest and best to read. Part three gets a bit too complicated for me, and in Part four, the symbols lose me and I even get bored.
