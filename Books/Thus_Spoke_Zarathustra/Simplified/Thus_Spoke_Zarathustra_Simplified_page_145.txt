"So it’s the same with us too!" said the two old night-watchmen and people who scared away ghosts. They blew their horns sadly. This happened last night by the garden wall.

But for me, my heart was laughing so hard it felt like it might burst. I didn’t know what to do with it, and it sank down inside me.

Honestly, laughing so much when I see drunk fools and hear these night-watchmen doubt God might be the death of me.

Isn’t it time to stop such doubts? Who today wakes up these old, scary, hidden things?

The old gods have been gone for a long time—and honestly, they ended in a good, happy way!

They didn’t make themselves sad and gloomy—that’s just what people say!

Instead, they laughed themselves to death long ago!

This happened when the most unholy thing came from a god himself—the words: “There is only one God! You shall have no other gods before me!” An old, grumpy, jealous god forgot himself and said this. All the gods then laughed, shook on their thrones, and said: “Isn’t it funny that there are many gods, but only one God?” Anyone who wants to listen, listen.

Zarathustra said this in the city he loved, called “The Pied Cow.” From here, he had just two days left to travel back to his cave and animals. His soul was happy because he was almost home.

Part 3, (9) THE RETURN HOME

Oh loneliness! My home, loneliness! I have lived wild and far away for so long that coming back to you makes me want to cry!

Now point at me like a mother does when she warns; now smile at me like a mother does when she’s happy; now just say: “Who was it that rushed away like a storm? Who, when leaving, shouted: ‘I have sat too long with loneliness; I have forgotten how to be quiet!’ You’ve learned that now, haven’t you?

Oh Zarathustra, I know everything; and you were more lonely among many people, you unique one, than you ever were with me!
