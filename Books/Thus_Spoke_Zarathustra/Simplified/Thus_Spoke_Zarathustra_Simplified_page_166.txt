A long time ago, people said to themselves: "We will be the best and rule over others!" Because, my friends, the best people should be in charge, and the best want to be in charge! If people think differently, then the best are missing.

If people got everything for free, what would they complain about? Working and earning is their real fun, and it will be hard for them!

They are like wild animals: when they work, sometimes they steal or cheat! That’s why life is tough for them!

They will become even smarter and stronger wild animals because humans are the smartest wild animals.

Humans have already taken away the good qualities of all animals. That’s why humans have had the hardest time.

Only birds are still free from humans. And if humans learn to fly, oh no, how much more greedy they would become!

This is how I want men and women to be: men ready for fighting, women ready for having babies, but both able to dance with their heads and feet.

And a day without dancing should never be lost.

And any truth without laughter should be false!

When you arrange marriages, make sure it’s done well! If you rush, the marriage will break.

Breaking a bad marriage is better than staying in a lying or twisted one!

A woman once told me, "I broke the marriage, but the marriage broke me first!"

People who marry badly are often the most bitter and make others suffer because they can’t be happy alone.

That’s why I want honest couples to say to each other: "We love each other; let’s work to keep our love! Or are we just making a mistake?" 

"Let’s have a trial marriage first to see if we’re right for the real thing!" 

Always being together is a big deal. This is my advice to honest people, and what would my love be worth if I said otherwise?

Marriage should help you not just to keep your family going but to become better and higher people, my friends!
