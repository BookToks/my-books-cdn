Right now, I’m lying here, still tired from all the fighting and pushing away, still feeling sick from trying to save myself.

And you just watched it all happen? Oh my animals, are you really that cruel? Did you enjoy seeing me in so much pain like people do? Because humans are the cruelest animals.

They find joy in tragedies, bullfights, and even crucifixions; that’s what makes them happiest on earth. And when they made up the idea of hell, that became their version of heaven on earth.

When a great person cries, little people rush over, their tongues hanging out because they want to feel something. They call it "pity." Especially poets—they complain about life with so much passion! Listen to them, but don’t forget that deep down, they enjoy complaining.

Life beats down those who complain just by looking at them.

The bold one says, "You love me? Wait a bit, I’m not ready for you yet." People are cruelest to themselves. And don’t miss how those who call themselves “sinners,” “cross-bearers,” or “penitents” actually enjoy their own complaining in a strange way!

And me—do I want to be the one who accuses humans? Oh, my animals, all I’ve learned is that people need their worst parts as much as their best parts. That all the bad stuff is actually the strongest power and the toughest challenge for the greatest creator. People have to become better and worse at the same time.

I wasn’t tied to this cross to prove humans are bad—I cried louder than anyone else, "Ah, their worst is so small! Ah, their best is so small!" I was filled with deep disgust for humans—it choked me and got stuck in my throat. And what the fortune teller said was true: "Everything is the same, nothing matters, knowledge suffocates." A long, sad tiredness dragged me down, like a heavy, drunken sadness that spoke with a yawning mouth.

"The same man comes back again and again, the one you’re tired of, the small man," my sadness yawned and dragged its feet, unable to fall asleep.

The world became like a cave to me; its heart collapsed. Everything alive turned to dust, bones, and decay.

My sighs sat on all human graves and couldn’t rise anymore. My endless sighing and questioning croaked and choked, biting and nagging day and night: "Ah, man always comes back again!"
