Becoming a Spiritual Adventurer

What is Eternal Recurrence? (Also Called "Eternal Return")

"This life you are living now, and have lived before, you will live again and again, forever. Nothing will be new. Every pain, joy, thought, and sigh will happen to you again in the same order — even this spider, this moonlight, this moment, and even me. Life will keep repeating like an endless hourglass being flipped over and over, and you will be part of it…"  
From Nietzsche's book, 'The Gay Science', Section 341

Waking Up from the Social Dream

About 40,000 years ago, during something called the Upper Paleolithic Revolution, humans started to understand that death is coming for everyone. We didn’t need a tiger to scare us anymore — our minds did that. So we got ready to face it. This led to 40,000 years of stories and social ideas.

Tribal religions, spirits, afterlives, legends, rules, good and bad, social manners, superstitions — many of these were interesting and touching, but mostly they were just low-level worries and constant mental noise. Beliefs went up and down, and people argued a lot. In the last 2,000 years, our social stories got bigger and more complicated: nations, holy books, “history,” “knowledge,” astrology, schools, literature, science, religions, and ideas.

It’s time to see how silly these made-up worlds really are — worlds that are “bigger than us” and try to give “meaning” to our “small lives.” We don’t keep living after death in heaven, hell, God’s lap, or a new body. We don’t live on through our reputation, science, knowledge, memories, inventions, books, good deeds, being a good citizen, or trying to “make the world better” or live a moral life.
