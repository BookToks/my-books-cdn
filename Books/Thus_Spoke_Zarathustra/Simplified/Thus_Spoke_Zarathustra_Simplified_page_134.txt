Here I am, still like a rooster in a strange farmyard, where even the hens peck at me. But because of that, I’m not mean to the hens.

I’m polite to them, just like I am to little annoyances. Being grumpy about small things seems smart only to hedgehogs.

They all talk about me when they sit around their fire in the evening, but no one really thinks about me!

This is the new quiet I have felt: their noise around me covers my thoughts like a blanket.

They shout to each other, “What is this dark cloud going to do to us? Let’s make sure it doesn’t bring disaster!” Recently, a woman grabbed her child when it came near me: “Take the kids away,” she cried, “those eyes burn children’s souls.” They cough when I speak; they think coughing is a way to fight strong winds – but they don’t understand how wild and happy I really am!

“We don’t have time for Zarathustra yet,” they say; but what does it matter if “time” doesn’t have time for Zarathustra?

And even if they praised me completely, how could I rest on their praise? Their praise is like a belt of thorns: it hurts me even when I take it off.

I also learned this from them: when someone praises, it’s like they’re giving back something, but really, they want even more in return!

Ask my foot if their flattery and tempting words make it happy! Honestly, my foot doesn’t like to dance or stand still to such small rhythms.

They want to praise me for tiny good deeds; they want to make my foot move to the beat of little happiness.

I walk among these people and keep my eyes open; they keep getting smaller and smaller—and that’s because of their ideas about happiness and goodness.

They are moderate even in being good—because they want comfort. But comfort only fits with being a little good.

Sure, they try in their own way to move forward: I call that hobbling. That just slows down everyone who is in a hurry.

Many of them move forward but keep looking back with stiff necks: those are the ones I like to meet.

Foot and eye shouldn’t lie or trick each other. But there is a lot of lying among small people.

Some of them lie on purpose, but most are made to lie. Some are true, but most are just pretending.
