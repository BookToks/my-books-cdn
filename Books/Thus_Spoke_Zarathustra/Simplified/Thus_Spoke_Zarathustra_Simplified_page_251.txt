Woe says: "Break, bleed, heart! Move, leg! Fly, wing!  
Keep going! Keep climbing! Feel the pain!"  
But cheer up, my old heart: Woe says: "Go away! Leave!"  

You smart people, what do you think? Am I a fortune teller?  
Or just dreaming? Or drunk? Or someone who reads dreams?  
Or a bell ringing at midnight? Or a drop of morning dew?  
Or a smell that lasts forever? Can't you hear it? Can't you smell it?  

Right now, my world feels perfect. Midnight feels like midday,  
Pain feels like joy, curses feel like blessings,  
Night feels like the sun—go away!  
Or you’ll find out that even a wise person can be a fool.  

Have you ever said yes to one joy? Then, my friends,  
You also said yes to all the pain. Everything is connected, linked, and tangled together.  
Have you ever wanted something to happen twice?  
Have you ever said, "I like you, happiness! Just for a moment!"?  
Then you wanted it to come back again!  

Everything is new, eternal, connected, and mixed together.  
If you love the world, you love it forever and always.  
You say "Go away!" to pain— but then you want it back!  
Because every joy wants to last forever!  

All joy wants everything to last forever. It wants sweet stuff and bitter stuff,  
It wants wild nights, graves, tears, and comfort,  
It wants pretty sunsets—what doesn’t joy want?  
It’s thirstier, stronger, hungrier, and scarier than all pain.  

Joy wants itself, it bites into itself, it twists and turns—  
It wants love and hate, it has so much it gives,  
It throws things away and begs for someone to take them,  
It thanks the taker, and would rather be hated than ignored.  

Joy is so full that it even wants pain, hate, shame, and the broken parts of the world—  
It wants this world, you know it well!  
You smart people, joy longs for you, for your pain, for your failures!  
Joy wants all of it, even the hard parts.  

Joys want themselves, so they also want grief!  
Oh happiness, oh pain! Break, heart!  
You smart people, learn this: joys want forever.  
Joys want everything to last forever, deep and true forever!
