Down there, talking is useless! Forgetting and just moving on is the smartest thing I’ve learned.

To really understand people, you have to experience everything about them.

But I’m too clean for that.

I don’t even want to breathe their air; it’s sad that I’ve lived so long surrounded by their noise and bad smells!

Oh, the peaceful quiet around me! The fresh smells! How this calm air fills my chest with fresh breath! How wonderful this quiet is!

But down there, everything talks, and nothing is understood right. If I try to share my wisdom loudly, the market sellers will just make more noise with their coins!

Everyone talks, but no one really understands anymore. Everything gets lost like water, nothing goes deep like wells.

Everyone talks, but nothing really works or gets done. Everyone makes noise, but who will sit quietly and finish something?

Everyone talks, but they just out-talk each other. Things that were once too strong for time are now worn out and talked about by everyone.

Everyone talks, and secrets are betrayed. What used to be deep and private is now shared by street performers and gossipers.

Oh, human noise, you crazy thing! You’re the noise in dark streets!

Now you’re behind me again—my biggest danger is behind me!

My biggest risk was always feeling sorry for people and spoiling them; and all this noise wants to be spoiled and accepted.

I lived among people hiding the truth, with a foolish heart and many small lies of kindness.

I pretended to be one of them, ready to blame myself so I could stand them, always telling myself, “You fool, you don’t understand people!” You forget what people are like when you live with them—there’s too much surface stuff in everyone. How can someone really see far or dream big there?

And, silly me, when they misunderstood me, I let them get away with it more than I forgave myself, always being tough on myself and sometimes even punishing myself for being too kind.

I was hurt all over by painful things, worn down like a stone by many drops of cruelty. And still, I told myself, “All small things are innocent in their smallness!”
