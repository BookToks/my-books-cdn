And just look at these men: their eye says it - they know nothing better on earth than to lie with a woman.
 
 Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and Alas. if their filth has still spirit in it!
 
 Would that you were perfect - at least as animals! But to animals belongs innocence.
 
 Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in your instincts.
 
 Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with many almost a vice.
 
 These are continent, to be sure: but doggish lust looks enviously out of all that they do.
 
 Even into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit does this creature follow them, with its discord.
 
 And how nicely can doggish lust beg for a piece of spirit, when a piece of flesh is denied it!
 
 You love tragedies and all that breaks the heart? But I am distrustful of your doggish lust.
 
 You have too cruel eyes, and you look wantonly towards the sufferers.
 
 Has not your lust just disguised itself and taken the name of fellow-suffering?
 
 And also this parable give I to you: Not a few who meant to cast out their devil, went thereby into the swine themselves.
 
 To whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded: lest it become the road to hell - to filth and lust of soul.

 They laugh also at chastity, and ask: "What is chastity?
 
 Is chastity not folly? But the folly came to us, and not we to it.
 
 We offered that guest harbor and heart: now it dwells with us - let it stay as long as it will!" Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 48 Part 1, (14) THE FRIEND "One is always too many about me" - thinks the anchorite.
