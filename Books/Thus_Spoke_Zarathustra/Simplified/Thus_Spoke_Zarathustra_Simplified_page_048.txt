Look at these men: their eyes show it—they love nothing more than being with a woman.

There’s something dirty deep inside them; and sadly, if that dirt still has some life in it!

I wish you were perfect—at least like animals! Because animals are innocent.

Am I telling you to kill your natural feelings? No, I want you to be innocent in your feelings.

Am I telling you to be pure? Being pure is good for some, but for many, it almost feels like a problem.

Some people control themselves, sure—but their strong desire looks jealous at everything they do.

Even when they act pure and cold, this desire follows them like a shadow, causing trouble.

And dog-like lust can be really good at begging for a bit of feeling when it’s denied a bit of the body!

You like sad stories and heartbreak? But I don’t trust your dog-like lust.

Your eyes are too harsh, and you look at people who suffer in a mean way.

Hasn’t your lust just hidden itself and pretended to be sympathy?

Here’s a lesson: many who try to get rid of their bad side end up becoming even worse.

If being pure is too hard, don’t force it—because it can lead you to a worse place, full of dirt and bad feelings.

Am I talking about dirty things? That’s not the worst thing I can do.

It’s worse when the truth is shallow and boring, making smart people avoid it.

There are truly pure people by nature; they are kinder inside, and they laugh more and better than you.

They even laugh at purity and ask: “What is purity?

Isn’t purity just foolish? But foolishness came to us, not us to it.

We welcomed that fool in and gave it a home: now it lives with us—let it stay as long as it wants!” That’s what Zarathustra said.

“One is always too many around me,” thinks the person who lives alone.
