Flatterers are just fake and whiny, nothing more.

Sometimes, they act nice to you. But that’s how cowards behave. Yes! Cowards think they’re smart!

They think a lot about you with their small minds – they always doubt you! When someone thinks too much about something, they end up being suspicious of it.

They punish you for being good. Deep down, they only forgive you for your mistakes.

Because you’re kind and honest, you say, "They’re harmless because they’re small." But their small minds think, "Everything big is bad." Even when you’re nice to them, they still feel looked down on; and they repay your kindness with secret meanness.

Your quiet pride annoys them; they’re happy if you become silly and humble.

What we see in a person can also bother them. So be careful around small-minded people!

When you’re near, they feel small, and their nastiness shows, even if you can’t see it.

Haven’t you noticed how they go quiet when you come close, and lose their energy like smoke from a dying fire?

Yes, my friend, you make your neighbors feel bad because they don’t deserve you. That’s why they hate you and want to drain you.

Your neighbors will always be like annoying flies; the bigger and better you are, the more annoying and fly-like they become.

Run away, my friend, into your own space – where a strong, fresh wind blows. It’s not your job to chase away flies. This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (13) CHASTITY

I love the forest. It’s bad to live in cities because there are too many people controlled by desire.

Isn’t it better to be in danger from a killer than to be caught in the dreams of a lustful woman?
