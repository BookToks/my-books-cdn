Slowly, while the important men held him up, he started to come back to himself a little. He pushed away the crowd who were trying to help and honor him, but he didn’t say anything. Suddenly, he turned his head quickly because he thought he heard something. Then he put his finger to his lips and said, "Come!" Immediately, everything became quiet and mysterious. From far away, the sound of a clock bell slowly rose. Zarathustra listened to it, just like the important men. Then he put his finger to his lips again and said, "Come! Come! It’s almost midnight!" His voice sounded different now. But he still didn’t move. Then everything got even quieter and more mysterious, and everyone listened – even the donkey, Zarathustra’s noble animals, the eagle and the serpent, the cave of Zarathustra, the big cool moon, and the night itself. Zarathustra put his hand to his mouth a third time and said, "Come! Come! Come! Let’s wander now! It’s time: let’s go into the night!

You important men, it’s almost midnight. I want to say something to you quietly, like that old clock bell says it to me. It sounds mysterious, scary, and friendly at the same time. That midnight clock bell has heard more than one person’s story. It has counted the painful heartbeats of your fathers – ah! ah! how it sighs! how it laughs in its dream! The old, deep, deep midnight!

Be quiet! At this time, many things can be heard that you can’t hear during the day. Now, in the cool air, when all the noise in your hearts has stopped, it speaks. Now it is heard, sneaking into awake, night-time souls: ah! ah! how midnight sighs! how it laughs in its dream!

Don’t you hear how it speaks to you mysteriously, fearfully, and kindly, the old deep, deep midnight?

Oh man, pay attention!

Oh no! Where has the time gone? Have I fallen into deep wells? The world is sleeping. Ah!
