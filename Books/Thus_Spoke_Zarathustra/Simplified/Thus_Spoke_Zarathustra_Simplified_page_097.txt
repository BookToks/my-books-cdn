So Zarathustra spoke.

I flew too far into the future and got scared.

When I looked around, time was the only thing with me.

Then I flew back home, faster and faster. That’s how I came to you, people of today, and into the land of culture.

For the first time, I saw you clearly and wanted to understand you. I really wanted to.

But what happened? Even though I was scared, I couldn’t stop laughing! I had never seen anything so strange and colorful!

I laughed a lot, even though my feet and heart were shaking. "This is where all the paint pots are," I said.

You sat there with fifty patches of paint on your faces and bodies, and I was shocked.

You had fifty mirrors around you, showing off your colorful looks again and again!

You couldn’t wear better masks than your own faces! Who could even recognize you?

Your faces are covered with signs from the past, and new signs are drawn over those — you hide yourselves well from anyone trying to understand you!

Even if someone thinks they can control you, you seem made out of colors and glued-together scraps.

Different times and peoples shine through your veils, and different customs and beliefs show in your movements.

If someone tried to take off all your veils, paints, and gestures, there wouldn’t be much left — just enough to scare the crows.

I am like that scared crow who once saw you naked and without paint, and I flew away when I saw the skeleton underneath.

I would rather be a day worker in the underworld, among the ghosts of the past — those ghosts are fatter and fuller than you!

This is what hurts me deep inside: I can’t stand you naked or dressed, you people of today!
