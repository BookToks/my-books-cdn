Probably not.

University philosophers have spent a long time playing tricky mind games trying to prove if free will is real or not, but it was mostly just for fun.

Any "what-if" statement about the past is totally silly. The butterfly effect isn’t something people actually saw but a math idea about complicated systems, which means everything in the universe except simple stuff like billiard tables or chemistry experiments. It means that even one tiny "what if" can change everything that comes after. For example, if I hadn’t gotten that parking ticket in 1972, none of my four kids would exist.

Thinking of your past as fate is smart. It’s almost the same as having no regrets or anger.

Thinking of your current actions as fate is also smart. Your feelings, thoughts, and experiences flow better and feel more real.

You don’t get stuck making tough “decisions.” It’s easier to just follow your heart.

Thinking of your future as fate is the hardest but smartest. Being scared to make choices because you think picking one option means losing out on everything else is kind of funny.

Why do you think you have superpowers to see and save a whole world? Life is about being aware, feeling things, and going with the flow, following the natural ups and downs.

You can never really know what that other person or path would have been like, and it wouldn’t have been all perfect.

Can I Remember Past Lives?

No. That’s silly.

Sometimes, people might get random, strange feelings about the future or déjà vu, but those come from the world you’re living in now, not some huge cosmic memory that lasts forever.
