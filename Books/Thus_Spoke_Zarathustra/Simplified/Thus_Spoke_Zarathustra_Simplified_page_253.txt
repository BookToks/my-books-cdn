"Wow!" he called out, "this feels good and right to me.  

My animals are awake because I am awake.  

My eagle is awake, and like me, it respects the sun. With its sharp claws, it grabs at the new light. You are my true animals; I love you.  

But I still don’t have my true people!" Zarathustra said. Then suddenly, he noticed that he was surrounded by lots of birds flying all around him — so many wings flapping that he closed his eyes.  

A cloud seemed to come down on him, like arrows shooting at a new enemy. But this cloud was different — it was a cloud of love, falling on a new friend.  

“What’s happening to me?” Zarathustra wondered, surprised. He slowly sat down on a big stone near his cave’s exit. As he moved his hands around to gently push the little birds away, something strange happened: his hand touched a thick, warm, furry thing. At the same time, he heard a soft, long roar in front of him — like a lion’s roar.  

“This is a sign,” said Zarathustra, feeling a change in his heart.  

When he looked, there was a big, strong yellow animal lying at his feet, resting its head on his knee — it didn’t want to leave him, loving him like a dog that finds its old owner again.  

The doves were just as loving as the lion. Whenever a dove flew close to the lion’s nose, the lion would shake its head, look surprised, and laugh.  

While all this was happening, Zarathustra said only one thing: “My children are near, my children” — then he became quiet. His heart felt free, and tears fell from his eyes onto his hands. He didn’t move or push the animals away anymore.  

The doves flew around, sat on his shoulder, and gently touched his white hair, never getting tired of their kindness and happiness. The strong lion kept licking the tears from Zarathustra’s hands, softly roaring and growling shyly. That’s what the animals did.  

This went on for a long time, or maybe a short time — because really, time doesn’t matter for moments like this.  

Meanwhile, the higher men woke up in Zarathustra’s cave. They got ready to meet him and give him their morning greeting, because they saw he wasn’t staying with them anymore.
