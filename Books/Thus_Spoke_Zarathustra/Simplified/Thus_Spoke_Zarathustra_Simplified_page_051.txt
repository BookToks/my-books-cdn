I found a lot of things here that people called bad, but there they were honored and respected.

Neighbors never really understood each other: each one was amazed by how wrong and strange the other seemed.

Every group of people has a list of things they think are the best. Look at it carefully. It shows what they are proud of and what they want to be powerful at.

They respect what is difficult and necessary; they call hard things good. And what helps the most in really tough times, they praise as special and sacred.

Anything that helps them rule, win, and shine—making their neighbors jealous—is the most important thing to them. It shows what matters most and why.

If you really understood a people—their needs, their land, their neighbors—you would understand why they try to overcome challenges and reach for their dreams.

The Greeks believed, "You must always be the best and stand out. You will only truly love a friend who’s like you." This idea made them want to be great.

My own people thought that "telling the truth and being good with a bow and arrow" was both good and hard, and that made me proud.

Another group believed in "honoring their parents and doing what they say with all their heart." That belief made them strong and lasting.

Another people believed in "being loyal, even if it means risking your honor and life, even in dangerous situations." By teaching themselves this, they became strong and full of hope.

People have made all their ideas of good and bad themselves. These ideas didn’t come from some voice from the sky—they created them.

People only give value to things to help themselves—they gave meaning to things based on what matters to humans. This is why people call themselves “men,” which means “the ones who decide value.”

To value something means to create it. Listen up, you creators! Valuing things is the real treasure of those things.

Without valuing, nothing really has value; life would be empty. Listen up, creators!

Changing what we value means changing the people who create those values. Anyone who wants to create must first destroy what came before.
