Even so, like an eagle or a panther,  
That’s how the poet’s wishes are,  
And your own wishes hide behind many different faces.  

You fool! You poet!  

You, who everyone saw as a god,  
Like a god among people, like sheep among humans.  
You tear apart the god inside people,  
Just like tearing apart sheep inside people,  
And when you laugh while doing this,  
That is your own happiness!  

The happiness of a panther and an eagle!  

The happiness of a poet and a fool!  
In the clear evening air,  
When the moon’s sickle-shaped light, green and glowing purple,  
Sneaks out, jealous and quiet—  
The enemy of the day—  
Step by step, it softly pulls down  
The rosy garlands of the day,  
Until they sink down into the night, faded and gone.  
One day, I sank down just like that,  
From my own crazy truth,  
From my strong longings all day long,  
Tired of the day, sick of the sunshine—  
I sank downward, even deeper into shadows.  

With only one truth,  
All burned and thirsty,  
Do you still remember, burning heart,  
How badly you thirsted then?  
That I should be banned  
From all the truth!  

You’re just a fool! Just a poet!  

This is how the magician sang; and everyone there,  
Like birds without knowing,  
Fell into the trap of his clever and sad pleasure.
