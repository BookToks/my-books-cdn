Ah! The dog howls, the moon shines. I’d rather die, I’d rather die, than tell you what my heart feels right now at midnight.

I’ve already died inside. It’s all finished. Spider, why do you keep spinning your web around me?

Do you want blood? Ah! Ah! The dew falls, the time comes—the time when I freeze and shiver, the time that asks again and again: "Who is brave enough for this?"

Who will be the boss of the world? Who will say: “This is how rivers big and small will flow!” The time is near: Hey man, listen up! This is for those who can really hear—what does the deep midnight voice say?

It lifts me up, my soul dances. Work of the day! Work of the day! Who will be the boss of the world?

The moon is cool, the wind is calm. Ah! Ah! Have you already flown high enough? You danced, but a leg is not a wing.

You good dancers, now the fun is over: the wine is spoiled, every cup is broken, the graves are whispering.

You haven’t flown high enough: now the graves whisper: “Set the dead free! Why is the night so long? Doesn’t the moon make us drunk?” You higher men, free the graves, wake the dead! Ah, why is the worm still digging? The time is coming, the time is near—The clock bell rings, the heart still beats, the worm still digs inside, the heart-worm. Ah! Ah! The world is deep!

Sweet lyre! Sweet lyre! I love your sound, your wild, flowery sound! How far, how long has your sound traveled to me, from far away, from the ponds of love!

You old clock bell, you sweet lyre! Every pain has broken your heart, father’s pain, grandfathers’ pain; your voice has grown strong—Strong like golden autumn and afternoon, like my lonely heart now says: The world itself is ripe, the grape is turning brown—Now it wants to die, to die from happiness. You higher men, don’t you feel it? There’s a strange smell rising—A scent of forever, a sweet, rosy, golden wine-smell of old happiness.

—Of drunk midnight-death happiness, that sings: the world is deep, and deeper than daylight can understand!

Leave me alone!
