There’s a difference between feeling abandoned and feeling lonely—that’s something you’ve just learned! And among people, you will always seem wild and strange, even when they care about you, because mostly they just want to be treated kindly.

But here, you are at home with yourself; here you can say anything and share all your reasons; nothing is ashamed or hidden.

Here, everything listens to you gently and tries to please you because they want to ride on your back. You use every comparison to reach the truth.

You can talk openly and honestly with everything here, and it sounds like praise to them when you do that—talking directly to all things!

But feeling abandoned is different. Do you remember, Zarathustra, when your bird screamed above you, when you stood lost in the forest next to a dead body, unsure where to go? When you said, “Let my animals lead me! I have found people more dangerous than animals”—that was feeling abandoned!

Do you remember when you sat on your island, like a well full of wine giving to empty buckets, sharing with the thirsty? Until finally, you were the only thirsty one among the drunk, crying every night: “Is taking better than giving? And is stealing better than taking?”—that was feeling abandoned!

Do you remember your quietest moment, when a dark voice pushed you out of yourself, whispering, “Speak and give in!”—when it made you hate waiting and silence, and made your small courage feel useless? That was feeling abandoned!

Oh loneliness! My home, loneliness! Your voice speaks to me so kindly and gently.

We don’t ask each other questions or complain; we walk together openly through open doors.

Because everything with you is clear and open; even time feels lighter here. In the dark, time feels heavier than in the light.

Here, all beings’ words fly to me openly; here everything wants to turn into words, and everything that is changing wants to learn how to talk from me.
