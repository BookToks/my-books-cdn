Good manners! Everything is fake and bad with us. No one knows how to respect anymore: that's exactly what we avoid. They are annoying dogs who try to look important.

This disgusts me because even we kings have become fake, dressed up in the old, worn-out glory of our ancestors, just showpieces for the dumbest, the sneakiest, and anyone who wants power right now.

We are not the first people – but we still have to act like we are. We're tired and fed up with this lie.

We have moved away from the noisy crowd, from all those loudmouths and annoying scribes, from traders and their stink, from restless ambition and bad breath – ugh, to live among the crowd! Ugh, to pretend to be the best among the crowd! Ah, disgust! Disgust! Disgust! What does it even matter about us kings now?

"Your old sickness is taking over," said the king on the left, "your disgust is taking over, my poor brother. But you know someone is listening to us." Right then, Zarathustra, who had been quietly listening, stood up, walked toward the kings, and said: "The one who hears you, the one who gladly listens, is called Zarathustra.

I am Zarathustra, who once said: 'What does it matter about kings now!' Forgive me; I was happy when you said to each other: 'What does it matter about us kings!' But this is my place and my power: what are you looking for here? Maybe you found what I seek: the higher man."

When the kings heard this, they hit their chests and said together: "You understand us!

With your sharp words, you cut through the darkest parts of our hearts. You have found our pain; because look, we are on our way to find the higher man – the man who is better than us, even though we are kings. We bring this message to him. Because the highest man should also be the greatest ruler on earth.

There is no worse tragedy in human life than when the powerful people are not also the best people. Then everything becomes fake, twisted, and terrible.
