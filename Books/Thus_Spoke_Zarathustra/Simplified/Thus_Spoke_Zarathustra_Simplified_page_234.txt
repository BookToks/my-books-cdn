Only the one who was careful about his spirit hadn’t been caught. He quickly grabbed the harp from the magician and shouted, “Air! Let fresh air in! Let Zarathustra in! This cave is stuffy and poisonous because of you, bad old magician!

You trick people, you liar, you sneaky one, leading them to strange desires and empty places. And it’s sad that someone like you talks so much about the truth!

It’s sad for all free spirits who aren’t careful around magicians like you! Their freedom is gone because you teach them and tempt them back into prisons. You old gloomy devil, your sad sounds are actually traps. You’re like people who praise being pure but secretly invite wild fun!

That’s what the careful one said. The old magician looked around happily, enjoying his win, so he tolerated the trouble the careful one caused. “Be quiet!” he said softly. “Good songs need time to echo well; after good songs, people should stay silent for a while.

That’s how all the important people here behave. But maybe you didn’t really understand my song? You don’t have much of the magical spirit in you.”

“You praise me,” the careful one answered, “by saying I’m different from you; fine! But what about you others? I see you all sitting there with greedy eyes—Free spirits, where’s your freedom? You almost look like people who have stared too long at bad girls dancing naked: your souls are dancing too!

You important men must have more of what the magician calls his evil spirit of magic and lies—we really must be different.

And yes, we have talked and thought a lot together before Zarathustra came home to his cave, so I know we are different.

You and I want different things even up here. I want more safety; that’s why I came to Zarathustra. He’s still the strongest and most steady tower today when everything is shaking and the earth is trembling. But when I see your eyes, it seems like you want more danger, more fear, more shaking.
