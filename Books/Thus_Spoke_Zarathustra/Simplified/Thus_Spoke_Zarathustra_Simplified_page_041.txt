"Having a baby is hard," some people say. "Why have kids if life is so tough? Only unlucky people end up with kids!" These people seem to give up on life.

"Pity is needed," says someone else. "Take what I have! Take who I am! Life ties me down less this way!" But if they always felt sorry for others, they would make people hate life. Being mean might actually be better for them.

They want to escape life, but they don’t care if they trap others with their problems and gifts.

And you, who find life hard and stressful, aren’t you tired of living? Aren’t you ready to give up?

All of you who like hard work, and don’t handle new or strange things well—your hard work is like running away, and your wish to forget yourself.

If you believed more in life, you wouldn’t focus so much on quick moments. But you don’t have the patience to wait—or even to relax!

Everywhere you hear people talking about death; and the world is full of people who need to hear about death.

Or “eternal life,” it doesn’t matter to me—as long as they leave quickly! This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (10) WAR AND WARRIORS

We don’t want to be spared by our toughest enemies, or even by the people we love most. So let me be honest!

My brothers in battle! I love you deeply. I have always been your equal. And I am also your greatest enemy. So let me be honest!

I know the hate and jealousy in your hearts. You’re not strong enough to ignore those feelings. So be strong enough not to be ashamed of them!

And if you can’t be wise saints, then please be warriors for wisdom. They come before and go with such sainthood.
