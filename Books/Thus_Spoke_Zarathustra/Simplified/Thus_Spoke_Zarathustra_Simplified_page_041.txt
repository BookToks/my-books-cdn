" "Giving birth is troublesome," - say others - "why still give birth? One bears only the unfortunate!" And they also are preachers of death.
 
 "Pity is necessary," - so says a third party. "Take what I have! Take what I am! So much less does life bind me!" Were they consistently pitiful, then would they make their neighbor sick of life. To be wicked - that would be their true goodness.
 
 But they want to be rid of life; what care they if they bind others still faster with their chains and gifts!And you also, to whom life is rough labor and disquiet, are you not very tired of life? Are you not very ripe for the sermon of death?
 
 All you to whom rough labor is dear, and the rapid, new, and strange you put up with yourselves badly; your diligence is flight, and the will to self-forgetfulness.
 
 If you believed more in life, then would you devote yourselves less to the momentary. But for waiting, you have not enough of capacity in you - nor even for idling!
 
 Everywhere resounds the voices of those who preach death; and the earth is full of those to whom death has to be preached.
 
 Or "life eternal"; it is all the same to me - if only they pass away quickly! Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (10) WAR AND WARRIORS By our best enemies we do not want to be spared, nor by those either whom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!
 
 My brothers in war! I love you from the very heart. I am, and was ever, your counterpart. And I am also your best enemy. So let me tell you the truth!
 
 I know the hatred and envy of your hearts. you are not great enough not to know of hatred and envy. Then be great enough not to be ashamed of them!
 
 And if you cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least its warriors. They are the companions and forerunners of such 41 sainthood.
