" Zarathustra answered: "What is there to be wondered at! With hunchbacks one May well speak in a hunchbacked way!" "Very good," said the hunchback; "and with pupils one may well tell tales out of school.
 
 But why does Zarathustra speak otherwise to his pupils - than to himself?"Part 2, (21) MANLY PRUDENCE NOT the height, it is the declivity that is terrible!
 
 The declivity, where the gaze shoots downwards, and the hand grasps upwards. There does the heart become giddy through its double will.
 
 Ah, friends, do you divine also my heart's double will?
 
 This, this is my declivity and my danger, that my gaze shoots towards the summit, and my hand would rather clutch and lean - on the depth!
 
 To man clings my will; with chains do I bind myself to man, because I am pulled upwards to the overman: for there does my other will tend.
 
 And therefore do I live blindly among men, as if I knew them not: that my hand may not entirely lose belief in firmness.
 
 I know not you men: this gloom and consolation is often spread around me.
 
 I sit at the gateway for every rogue, and ask: Who wishes to deceive me?
 
 This is my first manly prudence, that I allow myself to be deceived, so as not to be on my guard against deceivers.
 
 Ah, if I were on my guard against man, how could man be an anchor to my ball! Too easily would I be pulled upwards and away!
 
 This providence is over my fate, that I have to be without foresight.
 
 And he who would not languish among men, must learn to drink out of all glasses; and he who would keep clean among men, must know how to wash himself even with dirty water.
 
 And thus spoke I often to myself for consolation: "Courage! Cheer up!
 
 old heart! An unhappiness has failed to befall you: enjoy that as your happiness!" This, however, is my other manly prudence: I am more forbearing to 115 the vain than to the proud.
