Zarathustra said, "Why be surprised? When you’re with hunchbacks, it makes sense to talk like a hunchback!" The hunchback agreed, "True, and when you’re with students, it’s okay to share school gossip."

But then he asked, "Why does Zarathustra talk differently to his students than he does to himself?"

The scary part isn’t how high something is, but how steep it is!

It’s the steep slope where your eyes look down and your hand reaches up. That’s where your heart gets dizzy because it wants two opposite things at once.

Hey friends, can you guess what my heart’s two wishes are?

This is my steep slope and my risk: my eyes are fixed on the highest point, but my hand wants to hold on to the lowest place!

My will is tied to people; I’m chained to them because I’m pulled upward toward something greater.

That’s why I live among people like I don’t really know them: so my hand still believes in something solid.

I don’t really understand you people; sometimes I feel both sadness and comfort around you.

I wait at the door for any trickster and ask, "Who wants to fool me?"

This is my first smart move: I let myself be fooled so I don’t have to always watch out for tricksters.

If I always stayed on guard against people, how could I rely on them? I’d just be pulled away too easily!

It’s fate that I can’t see the future clearly.

Anyone who doesn’t want to suffer with people has to learn to accept everything; and anyone who wants to stay clean among people has to learn to wash even with dirty water.

So I often told myself to cheer up and be brave.

“Old heart, you didn’t get unlucky this time; that’s your good luck!” This is my other smart move: I’m more patient with people who are vain than with those who are proud.
