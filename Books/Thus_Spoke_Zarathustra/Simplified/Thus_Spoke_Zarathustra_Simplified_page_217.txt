Zarathustra watched all this with great surprise. Then he looked closely at each guest with polite curiosity, trying to understand them better and feeling amazed again. Meanwhile, the guests got up and waited quietly for Zarathustra to speak.

Zarathustra said, "You sad people! You strange people! So it was your cries for help that I heard? Now I also know where to find the person I’ve been looking for today: the better person. He is sitting right here in my cave! But why am I even surprised? Didn’t I bring him here with sweet offers and happy calls?

But it seems like you don’t get along well. You make each other upset, even though you’re all asking for help while sitting together. Someone needs to come first—a person who will make you laugh again, a fun joker, a dancer, a wild spirit, a funny old fool. What do you think?

Sorry, sad ones, for saying such silly things in front of you. You deserve better words! But you don’t know why my heart feels so lively—it's because of you and how you look, so please forgive me! Everyone feels brave when they see someone sad. Everyone thinks they can help a sad person.

You gave me this power—that’s a great gift, my honorable guests! A perfect present! So don’t be upset when I give you something too.

This is my kingdom and my rule: what belongs to me will be yours tonight. My animals will serve you, and my cave will be your resting place!

At my home, no one will feel hopeless. I protect everyone here from danger. That’s the first thing I offer you: safety!

The second thing I offer is my little finger. And if you take that, then take my whole hand and my heart too! Welcome here, welcome, my guests!" Zarathustra said this, laughing with love and playfulness.

After his greeting, the guests bowed again and stayed quiet. The king on the right spoke for them, saying, "O Zarathustra, from the way you gave us your hand and greeting, we know you are truly Zarathustra."
