Isn't the land more reliable?

Just like a ship stays close to the shore, pulling gently on it, a spider only needs to spin a thin thread from the ship to the land. No strong ropes are needed.

Like a tired ship resting in a calm bay, I am also resting now, close to the earth, faithful, trusting, waiting, tied to it with light, delicate threads.
