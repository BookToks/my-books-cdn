It really shakes and opens the heart of a lonely sailor.

I am still the richest and most lucky person – even though I’m the loneliest!

Because I had you, and you still have me. Tell me: who else has ever gotten such perfect gifts like I have?

I am still the one who carries your love and memory, growing with many colorful, wild qualities, my dearest ones!

We were meant to stay close, you strange but kind wonders; you didn’t come to me scared, but trusting, like I trusted you!

Yes, made to be faithful like me and to last forever, I now have to call you by your unfaithfulness, your fleeting looks and quick glances: that’s the only name I know for you.

You died too soon for me, you who ran away. But you didn’t run from me, and I didn’t run from you: we are both innocent in our unfaithfulness.

To kill me, they strangled you, my hopeful singing birds! Yes, my enemies shot their arrows at you – aiming for my heart!

And they hit it! Because you were always the dearest to me, my possession and what possessed me: that’s why you had to die young and too early!

They shot the arrow at my weakest point – at you, whose skin was soft like down, or more like a smile that lasted just a moment!

But I will say this to my enemies: What is killing a person compared to what you did to me!

You did worse to me than any killing; you took away what I can never get back – that’s what I say to you, my enemies!

Didn’t you kill my youth’s dreams and most precious wonders? My friends took you from me, my blessed spirits! I give this wreath and this curse to their memory.

This curse is for you, my enemies! Didn’t you make my forever short, like a note fading away on a cold night! Hardly like the sparkle of divine eyes, it came to me – just a quick flash!

Once, in a happy moment, my pure self said: "Everything will be holy to me." Then you filled me with ugly ghosts; ah, where has that happy time gone?

“All days will be special to me” – my young wisdom once said: truly, the words of a joyful wisdom!
