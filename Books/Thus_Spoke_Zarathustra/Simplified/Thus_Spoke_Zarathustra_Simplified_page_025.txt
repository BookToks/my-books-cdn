The weight-bearing spirit asks, "What is the heaviest thing I can carry to show my strength?" Then it kneels down like a camel, ready to take on a big load.

It wonders, "Is the heaviest thing to humble yourself even if it hurts your pride? To show your mistakes and laugh at your own wisdom?"

Or maybe, "Is it to leave your cause when it’s winning? To climb tall mountains just to challenge yourself?"

Or is it, "To feed on small bits of knowledge and suffer because you want the truth?"

Or could it be, "To be sick and send away helpers, choosing to be with people who don’t listen to what you need?"

Or maybe, "To step into dirty water because it holds the truth, even if you have to face cold frogs and hot toads?"

Or is it, "To love people who hate you, and reach out to something scary, even if it might frighten you?"

The spirit takes on all these heavy things. Like a camel carrying a big load, it moves fast into the wild.

But in the loneliest wild place, the spirit changes again: it becomes a lion. The lion wants freedom and to be the boss in its own territory.

Here, it looks for its last master to fight, and its last God, the great dragon.

The great dragon is called "You shall." But the lion’s spirit says, "I will." The dragon lies in its way, shining with gold scales. Each scale says, "You shall!" The dragon holds all the old values made over a thousand years.

It says, "All values are already made, and I represent them. There will be no more 'I will.'"

My friends, why do we need the lion in the spirit? Why isn’t it enough to be the beast of burden who gives up and respects what is?

Even the lion can’t create new values yet. But the lion can create freedom for new creations.

It can make itself free, and say a strong No even to duty. For that, my friends, we need the lion.

To claim the right to new values is the hardest thing for a spirit that carries heavy loads and respects the old ways.
