Zarathustra said: Wake up, deep and dark thought! I am your rooster and the morning sun, you lazy reptile who overslept: Wake up! Wake up! My voice will soon wake you!

Take off the chains from your ears and listen! I want to hear your voice! Wake up! Wake up!

There is enough thunder to make even the dead hear!

Rub the sleep, the blurry and blind feeling, out of your eyes!

Listen to me with your eyes too: my voice can heal even those born blind.

And once you are awake, you will stay awake forever. I don’t wake up old grandmothers just to tell them to go back to sleep!

You’re moving, stretching, breathing heavily? Wake up! Wake up! Don’t just breathe hard, speak to me! Zarathustra is calling you, Zarathustra who doesn’t believe in gods!

I, Zarathustra, who supports living, suffering, and cycles—I call you, my deepest and darkest thought!

I’m happy! You’re coming—I hear you! My abyss speaks, my darkest place has turned into light!

I’m happy! Come here! Give me your hand—wait! Oh no! Disgust, disgust, disgust—oh no!

But right after Zarathustra said these words, he fell down like he was dead and stayed still for a long time. When he finally woke up, he was pale and shaking, and stayed lying down. For a long time, he wouldn’t eat or drink.

This went on for seven days. His animals didn’t leave him at all, except the eagle flew out to find food. The eagle brought back food and put it on Zarathustra’s bed. So, Zarathustra lay surrounded by yellow and red berries, grapes, rosy apples, sweet-smelling plants, and pine cones. At his feet were two lambs that the eagle had taken from their shepherds.

Finally, after seven days, Zarathustra sat up on his bed, took a rosy apple, smelled it, and liked the smell. Then his animals thought it was time to talk to him.

“O Zarathustra,” they said, “you’ve been lying there with heavy eyes for seven days. Won’t you get up again?

Step out of your cave; the world is waiting for you like a beautiful garden.”
