Even the little God, who is loved by girls, can be found resting quietly by the well with his eyes closed.

He really fell asleep in the middle of the day, the lazy one! Maybe he was chasing butterflies too much?

Don’t be mad at me, beautiful dancers, when I tease the little God a bit! He will probably cry and be sad – but he’s funny even when he’s crying!

With tears in his eyes, he will ask you for a dance; and I will sing a song while he dances: A song and joke about the serious spirit, my strongest, most powerful enemy, who people say is the "lord of the world."

This is the song Zarathustra sang when Cupid and the girls danced together: Recently, I looked into your eye, Life! And it felt like I was sinking into something deep and endless.

But you pulled me out with a golden fishing rod; you laughed at me when I called you endless.

"That’s just how all fish talk," you said; "if they don’t understand something, they call it endless."

But I am only changeable, wild, and completely like a woman, not a perfect one: Even if you men call me "deep," "faithful," "eternal," or "mysterious." But you men always give us your own good qualities – oh, you perfect men!" She laughed like that, the unbelievable one; but I never believe her or her laughter when she says bad things about herself.

When I spoke directly with my wild Wisdom, she said angrily: "You want, you crave, you love; that’s the only reason you praise Life!" I almost answered her angrily and told her the truth; and nothing is more angry than telling your own Wisdom the truth.

This is how it is with us three. In my heart, I love only Life, and honestly, I love her most when I hate her!

But I like Wisdom too, sometimes too much, because she reminds me a lot of Life!

She has her eyes, her laugh, and even her golden fishing rod: am I to blame that they look so much alike?

And once Life asked me: "Who is this Wisdom then?"
