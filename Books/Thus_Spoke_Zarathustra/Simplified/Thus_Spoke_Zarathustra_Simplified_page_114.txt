Then, one cloud after another covered the spirit, until finally madness spoke: "Everything dies, so everything deserves to die!" Madness said, "This is justice, the law of time – that time must destroy its own children."

"Morally, things are set by justice and punishment. But where can we escape the flow of things and the punishment that comes with them?" Madness asked.

"Can we escape when justice lasts forever? The stone that cannot be rolled back is 'It was'; all punishments must also last forever!" Madness said.

"No action can be erased: how could punishment undo it?

This is what is forever true about punishment: that it means actions and guilt must keep happening again and again!

Unless the Will finally frees itself and stops wanting – but you know, my friends, this is just the crazy song of madness!

I led you away from these crazy ideas when I taught you: 'The Will is a creator.' Everything that 'was' is just a piece, a puzzle, a scary chance – until the creating Will says: 'But this is how I want it.' Until the creating Will says: 'This is how I will it! This is how I will it!' But has it ever said this? And when does this happen? Has the Will stopped being foolish?

Has the Will become its own savior and bringer of joy? Has it stopped wanting revenge and anger?

And who has taught it to make peace with time, and something even greater than peace?

Something greater than all peace must be what the Will wants – the Will to Power – but how does that happen? Who has taught it to want things in reverse?

At this point, Zarathustra suddenly stopped and looked very scared. His eyes were full of terror as he looked at his followers; his gaze felt like arrows piercing their thoughts. But after a moment, he laughed and said gently, "It’s hard to live among people because silence is so hard – especially for someone who talks too much." That’s what Zarathustra said.

The hunchback had been listening and covered his face during the talk; but when Zarathustra laughed, he looked up curiously and said slowly, "But why does Zarathustra speak differently to us than to his other followers?"
