You should dance for me and jump all your crazy jumps, but nobody can say, "Look, here dances the last happy person!" If someone tried to find that person here, they’d only find dark caves and hiding spots—not lucky treasure or new happiness.

How could anyone find happiness among people who feel trapped and alone? Should I look for the last happy place on faraway islands, lost in the ocean?

But everything is the same, nothing’s worth it, looking won’t help—there are no more Happy Islands! The soothsayer sighed sadly. But then Zarathustra felt calm and confident again, like someone who just came out of a deep, dark hole into the light. “No! No! No!” he said loudly, stroking his beard. “I know better! There are still Happy Islands! Stop sighing and being so gloomy!

Stop bringing rain and sadness into this place! Don’t you see I’m already soaked by your misery, like a wet dog?

Now I’m shaking it off and running away from you to get dry again. Don’t think I’m being rude.

This is my place.

As for the higher man—well! I’ll find him in the forests right away: his cry came from there. Maybe he’s trapped by a scary beast.

He’s in my territory, and I’ll keep him safe! And honestly, many scary beasts are around here.” Zarathustra then turned to leave. The soothsayer said, “Oh Zarathustra, you’re tricky!

I know you just want to get rid of me! You’d rather run into the forest and set traps for those beasts!

But what good will that do? Tonight, I’ll be back in your cave, waiting for you like a heavy block!” “Fine!” Zarathustra shouted as he walked away. “What’s in my cave is yours too, guest!

If you find honey there, go ahead and lick it up, you growling bear, and make your soul sweeter! Tonight, we both want to feel happy—

Happy and joyful, because the day is over! And you’ll even dance to my songs, like my dancing bear.”
