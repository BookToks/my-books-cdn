At last, they ask themselves, "Why did we keep going? Nothing matters!" They like to hear someone say, "Nothing is worth it! Don’t try!" But that kind of talk only makes you feel like a slave.

My friends, Zarathustra brings a fresh, strong wind to those who are tired of the journey; he will shake many up!

My free spirit blows through walls, even into prisons and trapped minds!

Wanting something frees you: because wanting is creating. That’s what I teach. And you should only learn in order to create!

Also, you should learn how to learn from me, and learn well! If you’re listening, then listen carefully!

There’s a boat waiting—it might sail into huge emptiness. But who really wants to get on this "maybe"?

None of you want to get on the boat of death! So how can you be truly tired of the world?

You say you’re tired of the world, but you haven’t even left the earth!

I’ve always seen you eager for the earth, still loving your own tiredness!

Your lips hang down for no reason—a little wish for the world still stays there! And in your eyes—don’t you see a little cloud of happy memories?

The earth has many good things—some useful, some fun. That’s why the earth is worth loving.

Many of these good things are like a woman’s breasts: useful and nice at the same time.

But you, world-weary ones! You lazy earth-dwellers! You should be whipped! Whipped until your limbs move again.

Because if you’re not sick or old, and the earth is not tired of you, then you’re just lazy or spoiled. And if you don’t start running happily again, then you will disappear!

We don’t try to heal those who can’t be saved—that’s what Zarathustra teaches—you should just pass away!

It takes more courage to end something than to start something new—doctors and poets all know that.

My friends, there are lessons made by weariness, and lessons made by lazy weakness, bad laziness: though they sound alike, they want to be understood differently.
