When they reached the cave’s door and their footsteps made noise, the lion suddenly woke up. It quickly turned away from Zarathustra, roared loudly, and jumped into the cave. The higher men heard the lion roar, shouted together, and ran away fast until they disappeared.

Zarathustra, feeling shocked and confused, got up from his seat. He looked around, stood still, wondered what had happened, and stayed alone. “What did I just hear?” he asked slowly. “What just happened to me?” Then he remembered everything that had happened from yesterday until now. “This is the stone,” he said, stroking his beard. “I sat here yesterday morning. The soothsayer came to me here, and here I first heard the loud cry of pain.”

“Oh, higher men, your pain is what the old soothsayer warned me about yesterday morning. He wanted to trick me into falling into my last mistake. ‘Zarathustra,’ he said, ‘I want to lead you into your final sin.’ My last sin?” Zarathustra shouted and laughed angrily at himself. “What could my last sin be?” Then he thought deeply again and sat back down on the big stone.

Suddenly he jumped up. “Sharing pain! Sharing pain with the higher men!” he shouted, and his face became hard like metal. “Well! That time is over! My pain and sharing pain—who cares about them? I’m not chasing happiness. I’m chasing my work!

The lion has come, my children are near, Zarathustra is ready, my time has come. This is my morning, my day is starting. Get up now, get up, great midday!” Zarathustra said this and left his cave, shining and strong like the morning sun rising over dark mountains.

THE END
