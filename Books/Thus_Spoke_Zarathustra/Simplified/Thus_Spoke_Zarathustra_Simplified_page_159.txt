Hey guys, are you really ready to hear the truth?

Trying something risky, feeling suspicious for a long time, hearing a harsh “No,” getting bored, and feeling hurt—these things don’t happen together very often. But when they do, that’s when truth comes out!

All knowledge so far has grown from feeling guilty! So, you smart people, break apart the old rules!

When there are planks, gangways, and railings over a stream, people don’t believe someone who says, “Everything is always changing.” Even simple people disagree. They say, “What? Everything changing? The planks and railings are still there!”

They think that over the stream, everything is steady—good and evil, bridges and supports, all of it! But when winter comes and freezes the stream, even the smartest start to doubt. They say, “Shouldn’t everything stay still?” “Basically, everything is still” — that’s what people say in winter, to feel better during boring times and cold nights.

But the thawing wind says the opposite!

The thawing wind is like a wild bull, not the calm kind used for farming—it’s furious and breaks the ice with its angry horns! And the ice breaks the bridges!

Hey guys, isn’t everything changing right now? Haven’t all the railings and gangways fallen into the water? Who still believes in “good” and “evil”?

“Woe to us! Hooray for us! The thawing wind is blowing!” — that’s what people are shouting in the streets!

There’s an old idea called good and evil. Soothsayers and astrologers have always been connected to this idea.

People used to believe in soothsayers and astrologers, so they thought, “Everything is fate: you must do it because it’s meant to be!” Then people stopped trusting them and thought, “Everything is freedom: you can do whatever you want because you choose to!” 

But honestly, about the stars and the future, there’s only been confusion, not real knowledge. And the same goes for good and evil—only confusion, not real knowledge!
