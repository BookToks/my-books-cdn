It’s you.

Luckily, you are not separate from the universe. You’re not a “ghost in a machine.” A ghost would die forever, and the machine would keep going. But you are connected deeply, every moment, with your body, the Earth, and the whole universe. Every moment, you are your body, the Earth, the universe, and nothing else.

When the exact same universe comes back, you are there.

Do I have a choice or a chance to make each return a little different?

A little better?

No choice, no chance, no different, no better… and no worse.

Each time you return, it’s exactly the same you. If there was even the tiniest difference, the butterfly effect would change your whole life, human history, and the future of the universe so much that after a huge number of years when you are supposed to return, you wouldn’t be there because the universe would be totally different.

That’s how connected you are to the universe.

If we are exactly the same each time, what about free will?

Nietzsche attacked the idea of free will again and again: “'Free will' … is the worst trick made by religious people … it was invented mainly to blame and punish people… We who don’t believe in morals want to get rid of guilt and punishment from the world.” If we take away this idea from religious people, is there any other point to it?
