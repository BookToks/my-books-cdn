Who made those caves and stairs for punishment? It was people who wanted to hide and felt ashamed under the open sky.

Only when the sky shines again through broken roofs, lighting up grass and red poppies growing on ruined walls, will I feel connected to this God again.

They called God the thing that hurt and challenged them. And honestly, their way of worship had a kind of strong, brave spirit!

But they only knew how to show love for God by hurting others, like nailing people to crosses.

They thought they could live forever as dead bodies; they dressed their dead in black. Even when they talked, I still felt the scary, dark vibe of graveyards.

If you live near them, you’re close to dark, dirty pools where toads croak their serious songs.

To make me believe in their Savior, they’d have to sing better songs! And their followers would have to seem more like people who were truly saved!

I’d want to see them without clothes, because only true beauty should teach about being sorry. But who would be convinced by fake pain?

Their saviors didn’t come from freedom or happiness. They never walked the path of real knowledge.

Their spirits were full of flaws, but in each flaw, they put their own idea of God to cover it up.

Their pity was so strong it drowned their spirit; when it grew too much, it always led to big mistakes.

They pushed their followers quickly and loudly over a narrow path, like there was only one way to the future. But even those leaders were just part of the crowd!

Those leaders had small minds but big souls. But even the biggest souls so far have only had small places to live.

They left marks of blood on their path, and their foolishness taught that truth is proven by blood.

But blood is the worst proof of truth; it ruins the purest teachings and turns them into lies and hate.

When someone is punished for their teaching, what does that really prove? It’s more important when a person’s own suffering creates their own teaching!

When a hot heart and a cold head come together, you get a loud, showy “Savior.” But there have been greater and nobler people than those noisy fake saviors!
