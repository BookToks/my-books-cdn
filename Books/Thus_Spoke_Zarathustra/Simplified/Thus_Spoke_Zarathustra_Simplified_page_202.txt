Look at your hand, old man," he said, "what a long and strong hand!

That hand belongs to someone who has given blessings. But now, it holds the one you’re looking for—me, Zarathustra.

I am Zarathustra, who says, 'Who is more ungodly than me, so I can learn from him?'

Zarathustra looked deeply into the old pope’s thoughts. Finally, the pope spoke: "The one who loved him the most has lost him the most. I guess I’m the most godless now. But who can be happy about that?"

"You served him until the end?" Zarathustra asked after a quiet moment. "Do you know how he died? Is it true that sympathy choked him? That he saw man hanging on the cross and couldn’t bear it? That his love for people became his suffering, and finally his death?" The old pope didn’t answer but looked away sadly.

"Let him go," Zarathustra said after thinking for a while, still looking the old man in the eye.

"Let him go, he’s gone. It’s good you speak well of him, but you and I both know who he really was, and that he took strange paths." The pope smiled (he was blind in one eye) and said, "When it comes to divine things, I understand more than Zarathustra—and I should.

I loved him for many years and did everything he wanted. A good servant knows a lot, even the things the master hides from himself.

He was a secret God. He didn’t get his son in a normal way. His faith stands at the door of betrayal.

People who call him a God of love don’t understand love enough. Didn’t that God also want to judge? But true love loves without expecting anything back.

When he was young, that God from the East was harsh and angry and made a hell for those he liked.

But in the end, he grew old, soft, and kind, more like a grandpa than a father, or even like a weak old grandma.

There he sat, small and tired by the fire, worried about his weak legs, tired of the world and of his own will, and one day he died because his pity was too much.
