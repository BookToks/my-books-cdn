In May, a famous language expert named Ulrich von Wilamowitz criticizes Nietzsche’s book, The Birth of Tragedy. In October, students start skipping Nietzsche’s classes because of the problems caused by his book.

On December 28, Ritschl visits awkwardly and says Nietzsche is becoming unpopular at the university. In February, Ritschl gets more upset with Nietzsche’s strange style and writing. He writes to a friend, “Our Nietzsche is really confusing… it’s weird how he shows two sides. One side is very strict and scientific, but the other side is wild, strange, and mixed with crazy ideas about art and philosophy! What bothers me most is how he disrespects his own mother, philology, which helped raise him.” In May, Nietzsche starts reading a lot about natural science.

On December 29, Ritschl and Nietzsche argue even more.

In February, Nietzsche keeps having health problems. Wagner says getting married might help him get better.

In July, the university faculty votes 6 to 4 against letting women join doctoral programs. Nietzsche is one of the few who votes yes.

In August, Nietzsche and Wagner disagree. Cosima says it shows Nietzsche can’t follow Wagner’s rules. Nietzsche spends a holiday in Flims and writes, “My health has been up and down, so I hope the break helps me rest and work. I only feel really good when I’m creating something.”

From March to September, Nietzsche works on a book called Schopenhauer as Educator (Untimely Meditations III). On January 31, he stops teaching at the local High School because of health problems. In February, his illness also stops him from teaching at the university.

In April, he asks Mathilde Trampedach to marry him, but she loves someone else.

In June, he asks for a year off from the university, and they agree, still paying him.

In the summer, Nietzsche’s close friendship with Wagner is almost over. He strongly rejects Wagner’s anti-Semitism. Later, when Wagner sends him a new opera, Nietzsche says he almost wishes his Jewish fan, Siegfried Lipiner, would rewrite it.
