Nietzsche was different from other philosophers. He mostly wrote short, sharp ideas called aphorisms. These ideas jump between different topics. The same topic can show up in many of his books. With this ebook, you can search through all 8 books at once to find themes or subjects you want to learn about.  

From the Introduction by the Editor:  
University philosophers, especially in America and England, have often been confused or annoyed by Nietzsche. He doesn’t fit into any usual category. His impact has been mostly outside of universities—among artists, dancers, poets, writers, novelists, psychologists, and playwrights.  

Many famous people said Nietzsche influenced them a lot. Some of these are Picasso, Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, William Butler Yeats, Rainer Rilke, Allen Ginsberg, Khalil Gibran, Martin Buber, H.L. Mencken, Emma Goldman, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Jack London, Franz Kafka, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Karl Jaspers, Alfred Adler, Fritz Perls, Eugene O'Neill, and George Bernard Shaw.  

Try reading Nietzsche yourself. He usually wrote in a direct and clear way, without using difficult academic words. See if his ideas bring out the artist, psychologist, or dancer inside you.
