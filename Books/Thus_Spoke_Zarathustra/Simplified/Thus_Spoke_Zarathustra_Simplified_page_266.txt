With this book, I start my fight against the usual ideas of right and wrong. This book says yes to life and shows love and kindness even to bad things. It brings back their true nature and their right to exist. It doesn’t attack morality; it just stops paying attention to it.

The question about where our ideas of right and wrong come from is super important to me because it affects the future of all people. We are often told to believe that everything is under control, that the Bible promises a wise power watching over us. But really, this is just a way to hide the truth—that until now, people have been controlled by the worst kinds of leaders: sneaky, angry, and fake “saints” who hurt the world and humanity.

This book feels like the wind that melts ice and snow: full of energy, change, and mixed feelings. It makes you feel grateful, like someone who didn’t expect to get better but suddenly does. “Gay Science” means celebrating a spirit that has survived a tough, long struggle without giving up, even when there was no hope. And now, suddenly, hope has arrived, bringing a new kind of joy.

“Dawn of Day” is a book that says yes to life, deep but kind and easy to understand. The same is true for “La Gaya Scienza”: it mixes deep thoughts with playful ideas in almost every sentence.
