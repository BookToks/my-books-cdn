Now, be my friends and heirs of my goal; I throw the golden ball to you.

Best of all, I see you, my friends, catch the golden ball! So I will stay a little longer on earth—please forgive me for that!

This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (22) THE BESTOWING VIRTUE 1.

When Zarathustra left the town he loved, called "The Pied Cow," many people who called themselves his followers went with him.

They came to a crossroads, and Zarathustra told them he wanted to go alone because he liked being alone. But his followers gave him a staff with a golden handle wrapped by a serpent around the sun. Zarathustra was happy about the staff and leaned on it. Then he said to his followers: Tell me, how did gold become so valuable? Because it is rare, not useful for work, shining, and soft in its shine; it always gives itself away.

Gold became valuable as a symbol of the highest goodness.

The giver’s look shines like gold. Gold’s shine makes peace between the moon and sun.

The highest goodness is rare, not useful for work, shining, and soft in shine: the best kind of goodness is the kind that gives.

I understand you well, my followers: you want to be like me and have the giving goodness. What do you have in common with cats and wolves?

You want to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves; that is why you want to gather all kinds of treasures in your soul.

Your soul keeps wanting more and more treasures because your goodness always wants to give.

You make everything come to you so it can flow back out from you as gifts of love.

Anyone who wants to take in all value must also learn to give love. But I call this kind of selfishness healthy and holy. There is another kind of selfishness, a weak and sick kind, that always wants to steal—the selfishness of the sick.
