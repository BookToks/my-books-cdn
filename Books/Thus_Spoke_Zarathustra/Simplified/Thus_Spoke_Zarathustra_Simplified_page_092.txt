Invulnerable am I only in my heel. Ever live you there, and are like yourself, you most patient one! Ever have you burst all shackles of the tomb!
 
 In you still lives also the unrealisedness of my youth; and as life and youth sit you here hopeful on the yellow ruins of graves.
 
 Yes, you are still for me the demolisher of all graves: Hail to you, my Will! And only where there are graves are there resurrections. Thus sang Zarathustra.
 
 Part 2, (12) SELF-SURPASSING "WILL to Truth" do you call it, you wisest ones, that which impells you and makes you ardent?
 
 Will for the thinkableness of all being: thus do I call your will!
 
 All being would you make thinkable: for you doubt with good reason whether it be already thinkable.
 
 But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So wills your will.
 
 Smooth shall it become and subject to the spirit, as its mirror and reflection.
 
 That is your entire will, you wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and even when you speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value.
 
 You would still create a world before which you can bow the knee: such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy.
 
 The ignorant, to be sure, the people - they are like a river on which a boat floats along: and in the boat sit the estimates of value, solemn and disguised.
 
 Your will and your valuations have you put on the river of becoming; it betrays to me an old Will to Power, what is believed by the people as good and evil.
 
 It was you, you wisest ones, who put such guests in this boat, and gave them pomp and proud names - you and your ruling Will!
 
 Onward the river now carries your boat: it must carry it. A small matter if the rough wave foams and angrily resists its keel!
 
 It is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and evil, you wisest ones: but that Will itself, the Will to Power - the unexhausted, 92 procreating life-will.
