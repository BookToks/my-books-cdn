I’m only safe in my heel. You live there forever, just as you are, very patient! You have broken free from all the chains of death!

Inside you is still the unfinished part of my youth; and as life and youth sit here on the old, yellow ruins of graves, you stay hopeful.

Yes, you are still for me the one who breaks all graves: Hail to you, my Will! And only where there are graves can there be new life again. That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 2, (12) You call it "WILL to Truth," smartest people, the thing that drives you and makes you passionate?

I call your will the desire to understand everything.

You want to make all things understandable because you doubt if they really are.

But everything will have to adjust and follow you! That’s what your will wants.

It will become smooth and open to the mind, like a mirror that reflects it.

That’s your whole will, smartest people, as a Will to Power; even when you talk about good and evil, and values.

You want to create a world you can respect and admire: that is your biggest hope and joy.

People who don’t understand are like a river carrying a boat: inside the boat are the ideas of good and evil, serious and hidden.

You put your will and values on this river of change; it shows me an old Will to Power behind what people think is good and evil.

It was you, smartest people, who put these guests in the boat and gave them fancy names—you and your ruling will!

The river now carries your boat forward: it has to. It doesn’t matter if the waves crash and fight against it!

The river isn’t your danger or the end of your ideas of good and evil, smartest people: but the Will itself, the Will to Power—the endless life force that keeps creating.
