If someone has learned a lot about where things started long ago, they will want to find out where new things will come from in the future. My friends, soon new people will appear, and new sources of life will come from deep places.

Earthquakes can block many wells and cause suffering, but they also reveal hidden powers and secrets inside the earth.

Earthquakes bring new springs to the surface. When old peoples face big changes, new life and energy burst out.

If someone says, "Look, here is a well for many thirsty people, one heart for many who long, one will for many helpers," then many people will gather around them, trying together.

Who can lead and who must follow—that is what people try to figure out! It takes a long time, with lots of trying, failing, learning, and trying again!

Human society is like an experiment, a long search. It is always looking for a leader! This is what I teach. It’s an experiment, my friends! And don’t believe in any “contract” or agreement that is weak or unsure—destroy that idea!

My friends, who is the biggest danger to the future of all humans? Isn’t it the good and fair people? They say, “We already know what’s good and fair, and we have it; too bad for those who still look for it!”

No matter how much bad people hurt, the harm done by the good is even worse!

No matter how much evil people hurt, the harm done by the good is the worst!

Once, someone looked into the hearts of the good and fair people and said, “They are like Pharisees.” But no one understood this.

Even the good and fair people couldn’t understand it because they were trapped in their own good feelings. The foolishness of the good is strangely smart.

It’s true that the good have to be like Pharisees—they have no choice!

The good must reject anyone who tries to make their own version of what’s right! That’s the truth!

The second person who understood their true nature—the heart and soul of the good and fair—asked, “Who do they hate the most?”
