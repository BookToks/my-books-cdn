He loved being alone and free in his cave, and he didn’t get tired of it for ten years. But one day, his feelings changed. Early in the morning, before the sun came up, he talked to the sun and said: “You big star! What would your happiness mean if you didn’t have people to shine on?

For ten years, you have risen to my cave. You would have gotten tired of shining and traveling if it weren’t for me, my eagle, and my snake.

But we waited for you every morning, took what you gave us, and were thankful.

Look, I am tired of my own wisdom, like a bee with too much honey; I need someone to take it from me.

I want to share it and give it away, so that smart people can find joy in their mistakes again, and poor people can find happiness in their wealth.

So I must go down into the world, like you do in the evening when you set behind the sea and still give light to the dark places, you bright star!

Like you, I have to go down, to the people I will meet.

Bless me, calm star, that you can watch even the greatest happiness without being jealous!

Bless this cup that is about to spill, so the golden water can flow everywhere and show your happiness!

Look, this cup will empty again, and Zarathustra will become a man once more.

This is how Zarathustra’s journey down began.

Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, and no one met him.
