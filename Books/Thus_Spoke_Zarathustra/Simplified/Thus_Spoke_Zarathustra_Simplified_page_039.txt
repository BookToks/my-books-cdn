Look at me. What have I been since you showed up here? It’s because I was jealous of you that I’ve ruined myself!” The young man said this and cried hard. But Zarathustra put his arm around him and took him along.

After they walked together for a while, Zarathustra started to talk: Your eyes show me how serious your problem is, even more than your words.

You’re not free yet; you’re still trying to be free. Your searching has made you tired and restless.

You want to be high up, where the stars are, because your soul is thirsty for them. But your bad feelings want freedom too.

Your wild dogs want to be free; they happily bark in their cage while your spirit tries to open all the prison doors.

It looks like you’re still trapped—a prisoner who’s trying to make their own freedom. Prisoners like that have sharp minds, but they can also be tricky and mean.

Even after being freed, the spirit needs to clean itself up. A lot of the prison and dirt still stick to it; its eye still needs to see clearly.

Yes, I understand your danger. But because I care and believe in you, I ask you: don’t give up on your love and hope!

You still feel noble, and others see you as noble too, even if they don’t like you and give you angry looks. Remember, noble people always get in other people’s way.

Even good people get blocked by noble ones. And when they call someone good, they often mean to push them aside.

The noble person wants to create something new and new virtues. The good person wants to keep the old ways.

The real risk for the noble person isn’t becoming good, but turning into a rude, proud, or mocking person who destroys things.

I’ve seen noble people lose their biggest hope. Then they started hating all high hopes.

After that, they lived only for quick fun and didn’t care about the future.

They said, “The spirit is all about pleasure.” Then their spirit lost its strength and now just crawls around, ruining things.

They once wanted to be heroes, but now they’re just focused on pleasure. Heroes scare them.

But because I care about you and believe in you, I ask you: don’t give up the hero inside you!
