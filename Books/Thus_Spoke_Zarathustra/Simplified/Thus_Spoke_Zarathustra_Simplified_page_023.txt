"They are my animals," Zarathustra said happily inside.

"The proudest and smartest animals under the sun have come to find me.

They want to see if Zarathustra is still alive. Really, am I still alive?

I have found people more dangerous than animals; Zarathustra walks on risky paths. I hope my animals guide me!

After saying this, Zarathustra remembered what the saint in the forest said, sighed, and thought to himself: "I wish I were wiser! I wish I was wise deep inside, like my snake!

But I’m asking for something impossible. So, I ask my pride to always stay with my wisdom!

And if my wisdom ever leaves me - oh, how it loves to fly away! - then let my pride go with my mistakes!" This is how Zarathustra’s journey down began.
