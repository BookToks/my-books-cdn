You seem to want the hardest and most dangerous life, which really scares me – the life of wild animals, living in forests, caves, steep mountains, and tricky valleys.

And you don’t like those who keep you safe the most, but the ones who lead you away from all paths, the ones who mislead you. But if you really feel this way, it still seems impossible to me.

Because fear is the most basic feeling for humans; everything comes from fear, both our mistakes and our good qualities. My own good quality, science, grew out of fear.

Fear of wild animals has stayed with humans the longest, including the animal inside themselves they hide and fear. Zarathustra calls this “the beast inside.” This fear has become smarter and more spiritual over time – today, we call it Science.

The careful one said this, but Zarathustra, who just came back to his cave and heard this, threw roses at him and laughed at his “truths.” “What did I just hear? You must be a fool, or maybe I am! I will turn your ‘truth’ upside down.”

Fear is rare for us. Instead, courage, adventure, and loving the unknown are what really matter. Courage is the whole early history of humans.

Humans have envied the wildest and bravest animals and taken all their strengths – that’s how we became human.

This courage, now smart and spiritual, with the power of an eagle and the wisdom of a snake, is what today is called— 

“Zarathustra!” everyone shouted together and laughed loudly. But a heavy feeling came over them. Even the magician laughed and said wisely, “Well! My evil spirit is gone!

Didn’t I warn you it’s a trickster, a lying and cheating spirit?

Especially when it shows itself clearly. But what can I do about its tricks? Did I create it and the world?

Well! Let’s be kind again and happy! Even if Zarathustra looks at us with a hard stare – just look at him!
