Sure, you would call it by its name and pet it; you would pull its ears and have fun with it.

And look, you share its name with everyone else, and you have become just one of the crowd, like everyone else with your so-called virtue!

It’s better to say: "I can’t explain it, and it has no name, but it’s both pain and joy for my soul, and it’s also the hunger in my belly." Let your virtue be too special for everyday names, and if you have to talk about it, don’t be embarrassed to stumble over your words.

Then say, even if you stammer: "This is what’s good for me, this is what I love, it makes me happy completely, and this is the only way I want good things.

I don’t want it because a God’s law says so, or because human rules or needs tell me to; it won’t be a sign pointing me to heaven or anywhere else.

I love a real, down-to-earth kind of virtue: it’s not very wise or smart like everyone says.

But that bird built its nest next to me, so I love and take care of it now that it’s sitting here on its golden eggs." That’s how you should talk about and praise your virtue.

Before, you had strong feelings and thought they were bad. But now you only have your virtues: they grew out of those feelings.

You put your highest goal right in the middle of those feelings, and that’s how they became your virtues and happiness.

Even if you were quick to anger, or full of desire, or obsessed, or full of revenge; in the end, all your wild feelings turned into virtues, and all your demons turned into angels.

You used to have wild dogs locked up inside you, but they finally changed into birds that sing beautifully.

You turned your poisons into healing creams for yourself; you used your sadness like a cow to milk—now you drink the sweet milk from it.

Nothing bad grows from you anymore, unless it’s the struggle between your virtues.

My friend, if you’re lucky, you will have just one virtue and no more: that way, crossing the bridge will be easier.

Having many virtues is impressive, but it’s a tough life; many people have gone into the desert and ended their lives because they were tired of being the place where virtues fight and battle.
