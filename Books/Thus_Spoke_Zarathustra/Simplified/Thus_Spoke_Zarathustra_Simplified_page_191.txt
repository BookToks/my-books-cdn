When there are only a few men left, and they act more like animals than humans, the people start to rise up and honor themselves. In the end, the people even say, “Look, I alone am good and right!”

“What did I just hear?” Zarathustra asked. “Kings sure have some strange wisdom!”

I’m amazed, and honestly, I already feel like making a rhyme about this—though it might not be something everyone wants to hear.

I stopped caring a long time ago if people don’t want to listen. Well then! Here we go!

(At this point, the donkey spoke up clearly and meanly, saying, “Y-E-A.”) Once, I think it was the first year of our Lord, the Sybil spoke sadly without drinking wine:  
“How bad things have become!  
Everything is falling apart! The world has never been so low!  
Rome has turned into a mess, its Caesar is like an animal, and God has even changed!”

The kings loved Zarathustra’s rhymes. The king on the right said, “Zarathustra, we’re so glad we came to see you!  

Your enemies showed us a picture of you in their mirror. You looked like a scary devil, sneering at us, and we were afraid.  

But what did it matter? You always pushed us with your words. Finally, we said: It doesn’t matter how he looks!  

We have to listen to him, the one who teaches: ‘Love peace as a way to get ready for new wars, and like short peace more than long peace!’ No one ever said such tough words: ‘What’s good? Being brave is good. The right kind of war makes every cause feel important.’  

Oh Zarathustra, your words made our fathers’ blood boil like spring in old wine barrels.  

When swords clashed like red snakes, our fathers loved life more; the sun during peace felt weak and boring, and long peace made them feel ashamed.  

Our fathers sighed when they saw swords on the wall, all shiny but useless! They wanted war so badly. A sword wants to drink blood and shines with that desire.”
