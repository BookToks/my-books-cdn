And if you’re not tough enough to break and chip away, how will you ever create something with me?

Creators have to be strong. It should feel amazing to you to press your hand on thousands of years like it’s soft wax. It should feel amazing to write your will on something harder than brass, something tough and noble. Only the strongest are truly noble.

My friends, I set this new rule for you: Become strong!

Oh, my Will! You change with every need, always needing something! Keep me away from small, easy wins!

You, the fate of my soul, who I call fate! You inside me, over me! Keep me safe for one big fate!

And, Will, save your greatest power for the final moment—so you can be unstoppable in your victory! Ah, who hasn’t been overwhelmed by their own success!

Ah, whose eyes haven’t filled with tears in that dizzy moment! Whose steps haven’t stumbled and forgotten how to stand after winning? I want to be ready one day, fully grown and strong like glowing metal, a thundercloud, or a full udder ready to feed.

Ready for myself and my secret Will: a bow waiting for its arrow, an arrow aiming for its star—a star shining bright at noon, glowing, pierced, and blessed by the sun’s powerful rays.

A sun itself, with a will that can’t be stopped, ready to destroy to win!

Oh Will, you who change with every need, always needing! Save me for one great victory! This is what Zarathustra said.

Part 3, (13) THE CONVALESCENT 1.

One morning, not long after coming back to his cave, Zarathustra jumped up from his bed like a madman. He yelled loudly, acting like someone was still lying there who didn’t want to get up.

Zarathustra’s voice was so loud and strange that his animals got scared and ran to him. Creatures from all the nearby caves and hiding spots slipped away—some flying, some crawling, some jumping—depending on how they moved.
