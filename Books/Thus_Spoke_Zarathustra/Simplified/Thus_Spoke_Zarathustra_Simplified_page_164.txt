Look at this tired person! He’s only a little bit away from reaching his goal, but because he’s so worn out, he’s stubbornly lying down in the dust, this brave one!

He’s tired of the path, the ground, the goal, and even himself: he won’t take another step – this brave one!

Now the sun shines on him, and the dogs lick his sweat, but he just stays there stubbornly and chooses to suffer – only a little bit away from his goal! Honestly, you’ll have to drag him to his success by the hair of his head – this hero!

It might be better to just let him lie there, so sleep, the comforter, can come to him with its cool, gentle rain.

Let him rest until he wakes up on his own – until he decides on his own to fight off all tiredness and what being tired has taught him!

But, my friends, make sure you scare away the dogs from him, the lazy scavengers, and all the annoying pests – all the pests from the so-called "cultured" people who feed on the sweat of every hero!

I make circles around me and set sacred limits; fewer and fewer climb with me to higher mountains. I build a mountain range out of even holier mountains. But wherever you try to climb with me, my friends, watch out so that no parasite climbs with you!

A parasite is a creepy, crawling creature that tries to feed on your weak and hurt spots.

Its trick is this: it knows when climbing souls feel tired. In your troubles and sadness, in your shy kindness, it builds its nasty home.

Where the strong are weak, where the noble are too gentle – that’s where it builds its nasty home. The parasite lives where great people have small weak spots.

What is the highest kind of being, and what is the lowest? The parasite is the lowest kind; but the highest kind feeds the most parasites.

Because a soul that reaches the highest and goes the deepest will have the most parasites on it – the soul that can explore itself the most, the soul that joyfully jumps into chance – the soul that exists and changes, the soul that wants what it desires – the soul that runs from itself and still catches itself – the wisest soul, which hears foolishness as something sweet – the soul that loves itself the most, where everything flows back and forth – oh, how could the highest soul not have the worst parasites?
