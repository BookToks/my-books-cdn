Where do you come from? And where are you going?

Laugh, laugh, my strong and bold badness! From high mountains, throw down your shiny, mocking laughter! Attract the best people to me like shining fish!

And whatever belongs to me in all the seas, whatever is mine in everything—fish that come out for me, bring them to me: I wait for that, the sneakiest fish-catcher of all.

Come out! Come out, my fishing hook! Go deep, you bait that makes me happy!

Drop your sweetest drops, you honey of my heart! Bite, my fishing hook, into all the pain and trouble!

Watch out, watch out, my eye! Oh, how many seas surround me, how many new human futures are waking up! And above me—what a pink and quiet sky! What clear, peaceful silence!

The next day, Zarathustra sat again on the stone in front of his cave. His animals were outside, looking for new food—and new honey—because Zarathustra had used up all the old honey. While he sat there, holding a stick and tracing his shadow on the ground, thinking deeply—not about himself or his shadow—he suddenly jumped back in surprise. He saw another shadow next to his own.

He quickly looked around and stood up. There stood the soothsayer beside him—the same one he had once fed and welcomed at his table. This soothsayer had taught that everything is the same, nothing matters, the world has no meaning, and knowledge is a trap. But now his face looked different. When Zarathustra looked into his eyes, his heart was shocked again: so much bad news and pale, cold lightning showed on his face.

The soothsayer saw what Zarathustra was feeling and wiped his face, as if trying to erase the feeling. Zarathustra did the same. After they both calmed down and got stronger, they shook hands to show they wanted to recognize each other again.

“Welcome here,” said Zarathustra, “soothsayer of great tiredness. It was not useless that you once were my guest and friend.”
