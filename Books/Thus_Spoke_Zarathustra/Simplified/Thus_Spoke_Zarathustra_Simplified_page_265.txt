The first attack in 1873 was aimed at German culture, which I already thought was really bad.

It didn’t have any real meaning, purpose, or direction; it was just based on “public opinion.” It’s a big mistake to think that Germany winning wars means their culture is better than France’s.

The second essay from 1874 shows what’s wrong and harmful about how we study science today. Life feels sick because of this cold, mechanical way of working, where people act like machines and jobs are split up too much. We forget that culture is the goal. Instead, modern science just creates more cruelty. In this essay, the “historical sense” that everyone is proud of is actually seen as a sign that things are falling apart.

In the third and fourth essays, I point toward a better idea of culture and how to bring back the true meaning of it. I show two tough examples of people who loved themselves hard and worked hard, who didn’t care about things like “Empire,” “Culture,” “Christianity,” “Bismarck,” or “Success.” These two people were Schopenhauer and Wagner — or in short, me, Nietzsche.

My book *Human, All Too Human*, with its two follow-ups, marks a turning point. It’s called a book for free spirits because every sentence shows a win — I got rid of everything inside me that didn’t fit my true self. I don’t believe in idealism; the title means: “Where you see perfect things, I see—human, sadly, all too human things!” I understand people better now. The “free spirit” means a spirit that has freed itself and taken control again.

This was the start of a new beginning for me at age 36 in 1880.
