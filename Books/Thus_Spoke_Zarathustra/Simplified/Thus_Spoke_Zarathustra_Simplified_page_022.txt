Look at all the people who believe in different things! Who do they hate the most? The person who breaks their rules and values, the rule-breaker. But that person is also the one who creates new things.

Friends, the creator doesn’t want followers or people who just believe blindly.

The creator wants friends who make new values and write them down in new ways.

Friends, the creator wants helpers because everything is ready to be gathered. But he doesn’t have enough sickles to harvest all the crops, so he picks some and feels frustrated.

Friends, the creator wants people who know how to sharpen their sickles. These people might be called destroyers or haters of good and evil. But really, they are the ones who gather the harvest and feel joy.

Zarathustra wants friends who create, friends who harvest and celebrate. He has nothing to do with followers or leaders who just control others.

And you, my first friend, goodbye! I have hidden you safely in your hollow tree, safe from danger.

But now I must leave; the time has come. Between one sunrise and the next, I found a new truth.

I won’t be a leader or a gravedigger anymore. I won’t talk to people who just follow or are stuck in the past; I have spoken to them for the last time.

I will join the creators, the harvesters, and the joyful ones. I will show them the rainbow and all the steps to becoming the overman.

I will sing my song to the lonely and the few who listen; to anyone who still wants to hear what hasn’t been said, I will fill their hearts with happiness.

I am moving forward toward my goal; I will jump over those who hesitate or fall behind. Let my progress be their downfall!

Zarathustra said this to himself when the sun was high at noon.

Then he looked up because he heard a sharp bird call. And look! An eagle flew in wide circles with a serpent hanging on it—not as prey, but like a friend, coiled around the eagle’s neck.
