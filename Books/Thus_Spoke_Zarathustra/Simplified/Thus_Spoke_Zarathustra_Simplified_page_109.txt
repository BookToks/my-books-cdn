He walked around sadly and tired; he started to look like the people the soothsayer had talked about. He said to his followers, “Soon, the long twilight will come. Oh no, how can I keep my light shining through it?

I don’t want my light to die in this sadness! It should be a light for faraway worlds and the darkest nights too!”

Zarathustra felt very sad inside and didn’t eat or drink for three days. He couldn’t rest and stopped talking. Finally, he fell into a deep sleep. His followers stayed awake all night, sitting around him, hoping he would wake up, speak, and get better.

When Zarathustra woke up, he spoke softly, like from far away: “Friends, please listen to the dream I had and help me understand what it means!

The dream is still a puzzle to me; its meaning is hidden and trapped. It hasn’t yet flown free like a bird.

In my dream, I gave up all life. I became a night-watchman and guard of graves, up high in a lonely mountain fortress of Death.

There, I watched over coffins filled with trophies of victory. Defeated life looked at me from glass coffins.

I smelled the dusty air of endless time. My soul felt hot and dusty too. Who could freshen their soul in such a place?

Midnight brightness was all around me; loneliness was there too, and deathly silence, my worst friends.

I carried the rustiest keys and knew how to open the creakiest gates.

When the gates opened, the sound was like a bitter, angry croak through the long hallways. The bird didn’t want to wake up and cried unhappily.

But it was even scarier and more painful when everything went silent again, and I sat alone in that evil quiet.

Time passed for me, if time even existed there—I don’t know! But finally, something happened that woke me up.

Three loud thunders rang at the gate, and the 109 vaults echoed and howled three times. Then I went to the gate.”
