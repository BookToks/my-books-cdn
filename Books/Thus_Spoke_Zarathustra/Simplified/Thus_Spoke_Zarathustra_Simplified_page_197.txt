You’re proud of catching me, you thief hiding behind the clouds… Speak up!

You covered in lightning! You mysterious one! Talk!

What do you want from me, highway robber?

What do you want, unknown God?

What?

Ransom money?

How much ransom money?

Ask for a lot—enough to hurt my pride!

And be quick—my other pride demands it!

Ha! Ha!

You want me? Me?

Completely? Ha! Ha!

And you’ll torture me, you fool? Dead torture to break my pride?

Give me love—who still warms me?

Who still loves me? Give me warm hands, give me comforting warmth, give me, the loneliest one, ice (ah! ice frozen seven times over, made for enemies, for foes, that makes me thirsty).

Give me, cruel enemy—give me yourself! Go away!

There he went, my last and only friend, my greatest enemy, my unfamiliar, my hangman-God! No!

Come back!

With all your terrible tortures!

To me, the last lonely one, oh, come back!
