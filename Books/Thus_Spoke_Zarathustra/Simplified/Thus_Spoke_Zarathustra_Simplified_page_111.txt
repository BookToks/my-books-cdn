Zarathustra sat up straight on his couch, looking distant. He looked at his followers like someone coming back from a long trip, studying their faces; but he still didn’t recognize them. When they helped him stand up, his eyes suddenly changed. He understood everything that had happened, stroked his beard, and said loudly, "Well! This is the right time; but make sure, my followers, that we have a good meal—and quickly! That’s how I want to make up for bad dreams!"

The fortune-teller will eat and drink beside me, and I will show him a sea where he can drown himself!" Zarathustra said this. Then he looked carefully at the follower who had explained the dream and shook his head.

One day, when Zarathustra was crossing the big bridge, the disabled and beggars surrounded him. A hunchback said, "Look, Zarathustra! Even people are learning from you and starting to believe in your teachings. But to make them believe in you completely, you need to convince us disabled first! Here’s a good chance for you. You can heal the blind, make the lame walk, and take some weight from the overweight—this would be the best way to make us believe in you!"

Zarathustra replied, "If you take the hump from the hunchback, you take away his spirit—that’s what people say. If you give the blind man eyes, he will see too many bad things and curse the one who healed him. And if you make the lame man walk, you hurt him the most, because his bad habits will run wild—people say that about the disabled. So why shouldn’t I learn from people when they learn from me?"

Since I’ve been among people, it doesn’t matter to me if one is missing an eye, another an ear, a third a leg, or if some have lost their tongue, nose, or even their head.
