These versions are based on older translations by different people: H.L. Mencken in 1919, Helen Zimmern in 1909, and Horace B. Samuel in 1910.

The ebook cover has two photos. The bottom one shows Nietzsche joking with his friends Miss Lou Salomè (on the left) and Paul Ree (in the middle). Nietzsche suggested how the photo should be taken and arranged. The top photo shows Nietzsche when he was 31 years old.

The Nietzsche Love of Fate Series includes the full texts of Nietzsche’s eight best and most mature books. His books written before 1880, like The Dawn, are not as developed. The Case of Wagner and Nietzsche Contro Wagner, both from 1888, focus on too narrow topics.

The famous book The Will to Power (1901) is a collection of notes that Nietzsche’s sister edited and published after he died. Many scholars argue about how valuable it really is. One expert, Mazzino Montinari, even called it a "forgery." Walter Kaufmann said in his introduction that Nietzsche could have included these notes in his published works but didn’t, so maybe he wasn’t completely happy with them. Because of this, The Will to Power is not part of his "best 8" books.

In his autobiography, Nietzsche said that Zarathustra was his most inspired and important book. The main idea in it is "eternal recurrence," which means loving your fate so much that you want nothing to change — not the past, present, or future — for all eternity. This strange but simple idea deserves more attention than it usually gets.
