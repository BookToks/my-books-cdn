Oh, fate and sea! Now I have to go down to you!

I’m standing before my biggest challenge and my longest journey. So, I have to go deeper down than I ever climbed before—deeper into pain than I’ve ever felt, even into its darkest part! That’s what my fate wants. Well! I’m ready.

Where do the tallest mountains come from? I once asked that. Then I learned they come from the sea.

You can see the proof on the stones and walls of the mountain tops. The highest things come from the deepest places. Zarathustra said this on a cold mountain ridge. But when he got close to the sea and stood alone on the cliffs, he was tired and more eager than ever.

Everything is still asleep, he said; even the sea is asleep. Its eye looks at me slowly and strangely.

But it breathes warmly—I can feel it. I also feel it is dreaming. It moves gently on hard pillows.

Listen! How it groans with bad memories! Or bad things it’s afraid will happen?

Ah, I’m sad with you, you dark monster, and angry at myself because of you.

Ah, I wish my hand was strong enough! I would gladly free you from your bad dreams! While Zarathustra said this, he laughed at himself sadly and bitterly. What! Zarathustra, he said, will you really try to cheer up the sea?

Ah, you kind fool, Zarathustra, you trust too much! But you’ve always been like this: confident when facing scary things.

You would even try to hug every monster. A little warm breath, a soft paw: and you would be ready to love and calm it.

Love is dangerous for someone lonely, love for anything alive! My foolishness and shyness in love are really funny! Zarathustra said this and laughed again. Then he thought of his lost friends—and felt bad for thinking that way. Suddenly, his laughter turned into tears—Zarathustra cried bitterly with anger and longing.
