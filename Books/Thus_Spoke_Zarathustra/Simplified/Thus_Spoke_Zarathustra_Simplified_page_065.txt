Let your love and your knowledge be what gives life meaning on earth! This is what I ask you to do.

Don’t let your goodness fly away from the earth and get lost in some distant place! So much good has been lost like that before.

Help, like I do, to bring that lost goodness back to the earth – back to our bodies and lives – so it can give the earth a real, human meaning!

Many times, both spirit and goodness have been lost and messed up. Sadly, all this confusion still lives inside our bodies and wills.

Spirit and goodness have tried and failed many times. Humans have made many mistakes and learned wrong things.

Not just smart thinking from thousands of years, but also crazy ideas come from us. Being the next generation is risky.

Still, we fight little by little against random chance, but so far, nonsense and meaninglessness have ruled over all people.

Let your spirit and goodness focus on making sense of the earth, my friends: let you decide what really matters! That’s why you must fight! That’s why you must create!

The body cleanses itself wisely; it grows stronger by trying; all actions become sacred to those who understand; the soul becomes happy to those who rise up.

Doctor, heal yourself first: then you can help your patient. The best cure is to see someone who is getting better.

There are a thousand paths no one has walked yet; a thousand ways to heal and secret places full of life. Humans and the world are still full of unknown things.

Wake up and listen, lonely ones! Winds from the future are coming quietly, bringing good news to those who listen carefully.

You lonely and separate ones, one day you will become a people: from those who choose themselves, a special people will rise – and from them, a better human will come.

The earth will truly become a place of healing! And already a new, hopeful feeling is spreading around it, bringing salvation and hope!

When Zarathustra finished speaking, he stopped, like he hadn’t said everything yet; he held his staff uncertainly in his hand. Finally, his voice changed and he said:  
I now go alone, my followers!
