Your heart looks out over wild seas, searching and waiting. The deep feelings inside shine like the happy sky in your eyes!

And really, my soul, who could see your smile and not cry? Even angels cry because your smile is so kind and full of feeling.

Your kindness is so strong that it never complains or cries. But still, my soul, your smile wants to cry, and your shaking lips want to sob.

"Isn't crying the same as complaining? And complaining means blaming?" You ask yourself this. So, my soul, you choose to smile instead of crying out your sadness. You hold back your tears about how full you feel and how much you long, like a vine waiting for the farmer and the harvest knife.

But if you don’t cry out your deep sadness, then you will have to sing, my soul! Look, I’m smiling now, telling you this: you will have to sing with strong feeling until the wild seas calm down and listen to your longing.

Until, over the calm seas, a small golden boat floats—the amazing boat that carries all good, bad, and strange things. Many animals, big and small, and all creatures with glowing feet that can run on violet-blue paths, move toward this golden boat and its captain. He is the farmer who waits with a shining harvest knife—your great rescuer, the nameless one, who future songs will name!

And already, your breath smells like these future songs. You shine and dream, you drink deeply from all the comforting wells, and your sadness rests in the joy of songs to come!

My soul, now I have given you everything, even my last gift, and my hands are empty because of you: I told you to sing, and that was the last thing I could give!

I told you to sing—so now, tell me, who should thank whom? Even better, sing to me, sing, my soul! Let me thank you!

This is what Zarathustra said.
