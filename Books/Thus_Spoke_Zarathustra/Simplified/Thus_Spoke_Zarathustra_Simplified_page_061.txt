The idea sounds weird: "Die at the right time!"

Zarathustra teaches us to die at the right time.

But if someone never really lives at the right time, how could they ever die at the right time? Maybe it would be better if they were never born! That’s what I say to people who don’t really matter.

Still, even those people make a big deal about dying, and even the emptiest person wants to be noticed.

Everyone thinks dying is a big deal, but death isn’t a celebration yet. People haven’t learned how to make death a kind of party.

I show you a perfect kind of death, one that gives hope and promise to those still alive.

When this perfect person dies, they die like a winner, surrounded by people who are hopeful.

That’s how people should learn to die; and at every celebration like this, the dying person should inspire the living to keep their promises.

Dying like this is the best way; the next best is to die fighting, giving up your life for something big.

But fighters hate the sneaky, smiling death that comes like a thief but is still in charge.

I respect the death that comes when I choose it.

When would I choose it? Someone with a goal and someone to pass things on to wants to die at the right time for them.

Out of respect for the goal and the person who follows, they won’t waste any more time living without purpose.

I don’t want to be like those who keep stretching out their lives and going backward.

Many people get too old for their own beliefs and achievements; a mouth without teeth shouldn’t speak every truth.

Anyone who wants to be famous has to say goodbye to honor early and learn the hard skill of leaving at the right time.

You should stop being celebrated while you’re still at your best—that’s what those who want to be loved for a long time know.

Sure, some people are like sour apples—they have to wait until the last day of autumn, and by then they’re ripe, yellow, and shriveled.
