I’ve already given you advice, right? But remember, I’m the ugliest man, with the biggest, heaviest feet. Wherever I go, the path is rough. I walk only paths full of death and destruction.

But you didn’t say anything when you saw me, you just blushed—I noticed that. That’s how I knew you were Zarathustra.

Everyone else would have looked at me with pity, ready to give me charity with their eyes and words. But you didn’t—and that showed me you’re not someone who gives pity like that.

Because I’m not poor in spirit—I’m rich in something huge, scary, ugly, and hard to describe! Your shame, Zarathustra, honored me.

It was hard for me to get away from the crowd of people feeling sorry for me so I could find the one person who teaches that “pity is annoying”—and that’s you, Zarathustra.

Whether it’s the pity of a god or just human pity, it offends pride. Sometimes not wanting to help is nobler than rushing in to do so.

But right now, everyone calls pity a virtue—especially small-minded people. They don’t respect big misfortune, ugliness, or failure.

I look beyond all that, like a dog looking over a crowd of sheep. They’re small, soft, kind, dull people.

Like a heron looking down at shallow water with its head bent back, I look at the crowd of little waves, little wills, and little souls with disgust.

For too long, we’ve believed these small-minded people are right. Because of that, they’ve gained power. Now they teach that “good” is only what these small people say is good.

And “truth” today is what a preacher from among them said, that strange saint who claimed: “I am the truth.” That arrogant guy made these small people proud. He made a big mistake when he said, “I am the truth.” Has anyone so full of themselves ever been answered so politely?

But you, Zarathustra, ignored him and said: “No! No! No!” You warned us about his mistake—you were the first to warn against pity. Not everyone, but you and your kind.

You are ashamed of the shame felt by great sufferers. And when you say, “Pity brings a heavy cloud; be careful, people!” and when you teach that “All creators are tough, and all great love is beyond pity,” Zarathustra, you really seem to understand the signs of the weather!
