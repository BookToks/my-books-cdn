But does Zarathustra need to be scared of his shadow? Also, I think that after all, it has longer legs than mine." Zarathustra said this, laughing with his eyes and inside. He stopped and turned around quickly—and wow, he almost made his shadow fall because it was following him so closely and was so weak. When Zarathustra looked closely at it, he got scared like seeing a sudden ghost because the shadow looked so thin, dark, hollow, and worn out.

"Who are you?" Zarathustra asked strongly, "What are you doing here? And why do you call yourself my shadow? I don’t like you."

"Please forgive me," the shadow said, "that it’s me; and if you don’t like me—well, Zarathustra, that just shows how good your taste is.

I’m a wanderer who has followed you for a long time; always moving but with no real goal or home. I’m almost like the forever wandering Jew, except I’m not forever and not Jewish.

What? Do I have to keep moving forever? Blown by every wind, unsettled and pushed around? Oh earth, you’re too round for me!

I’ve already sat on every surface, falling asleep like tired dust on mirrors and windows: everything takes from me, nothing gives back; I’m getting thin—I’m almost just a shadow.

But after you, Zarathustra, I have run and hurried the most; even when I hid from you, I was still your best shadow: wherever you sat, I sat too.

With you, I have traveled to the farthest, coldest places, like a ghost who likes to haunt winter roofs and snow.

With you, I have gone into all the forbidden, the worst, and the farthest places; if I have any good in me, it’s that I never feared breaking rules.

With you, I have destroyed everything my heart once respected; I knocked down all boundary stones and statues; I chased the most dangerous wishes—really, I went beyond every crime.

With you, I stopped believing in words, values, and great names. When the devil sheds his skin, doesn’t his name fall away too? That’s just skin. Maybe the devil himself is just skin.

"Nothing is true, everything is allowed," I told myself. I jumped headfirst into the coldest water with my heart. Oh, how many times I stood there naked because of that, like a red crab!

Oh, where have all my goodness, my shame, and my faith in what’s good gone?
