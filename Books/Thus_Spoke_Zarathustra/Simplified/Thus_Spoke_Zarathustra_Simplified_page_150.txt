Voluptuousness: to people who hate their bodies, it feels like pain and punishment; and to those who believe in life after death, it’s cursed as "the world" because it tricks and confuses all wrong teachers.

Voluptuousness: to the common crowd, it’s like a slow fire burning them; to all weak and useless things, it’s the heat that breaks them down.

Voluptuousness: to free and happy hearts, it’s innocent and natural, like the joy found in a garden, and it brings future happiness to the present.

Voluptuousness: only to weak people is it a sweet poison; but to strong-willed people, it’s a powerful medicine, like the best and most respected wine.

Voluptuousness: it stands for a deeper happiness and the greatest hope. Many people are promised marriage and even more—but many don’t really know each other, not like a man and woman should—and who truly understands how unknown they are to each other?

Voluptuousness: but I will keep my thoughts and words protected, so that rude and careless people don’t invade my private feelings!

Passion for power: it’s a burning pain for the toughest people; a cruel punishment meant for the cruel; a dark fire that burns alive.

Passion for power: it’s like an annoying bug that rides on the proudest people; it mocks all weak kindness; it controls every pride and leader.

Passion for power: it’s an earthquake that destroys all that is fake and rotten; it breaks down fake goodness; it questions quick and wrong answers.

Passion for power: before it, people crawl and work hard, becoming lower than snakes and pigs—until finally they shout out in great anger.

Passion for power: it’s a harsh teacher that shows great anger, telling cities and empires to “Get lost!”—until they themselves cry out, “I must go!”

Passion for power: yet it also attracts even the pure and alone, lifting them up to proud heights, glowing like a love that paints beautiful dreams on earth.

Passion for power: but who would call it passion, when the highest point wants to bend down just for power!
