The eight digital books in the "Nietzsche Love of Fate Series" can be downloaded one by one or all together (2.1 MB download). All books are complete and not shortened.

You cannot use anything from these ebooks, like the introductions, appendices, or links, to make money without permission from Bill Chapko.

The translations are based on versions published between 1899 and 1919. These eight books have been changed a bit, especially Zarathustra. Old words that people don’t use anymore, like fain, hitherto, thee, wouldst, therefrom, nigh, ye, and forsooth, have been replaced with modern English words.

The eight books are: The Gay Science, which is a changed digital version based on the 1910 translation by Thomas Common.

Ecce Homo, a changed digital version based on the 1911 translation by Anthony M. Ludovici.

Zarathustra, a mostly changed digital version based on the 1909 translation by Thomas Common.

The Dawn, a changed digital version based on the 1911 translation by J. M. Kennedy.

Twilight of the Idols, a changed digital version based on the 1899 translation by Thomas Common.
