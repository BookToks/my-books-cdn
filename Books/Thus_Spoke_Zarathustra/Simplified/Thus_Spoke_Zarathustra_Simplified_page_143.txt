Did their ears maybe wait a long time, hoping to hear me, but didn’t? Did they wait for my trumpet sounds and my calls but got nothing?

There are only a few people who have brave and lively hearts, and they are also patient. But most people are scared and weak.

Most people are like that: ordinary, extra, too many—and they are scared! People like me will face things like I do: their first friends will be dead people and fools.

Their next friends will say they believe in them—they will be full of love, silliness, and respect.

But someone like me won’t trust those believers with their heart. In those bright and colorful times, I won’t believe in people who are so weak and changeable!

If they could be different, they would be. Half-hearted people spoil everything. Leaves dry up—that’s okay, there’s no need to be sad!

Let them go and fall away, Zarathustra, don’t be sad! It’s better to blow the dry leaves away with the wind—blow them away fast!

“We’ve become religious again,” some give up and say this; some are too scared even to say it.

I look them in the eye and say it to their face, making them blush: you are the ones praying again!

But praying is embarrassing! Not for everyone, but for you, me, and anyone with a clear conscience. For you, it’s embarrassing to pray!

You know it well: the scared part of you wants to just give up, relax, and do nothing. This scared part tells you, “There is a God!” But that means you are afraid of the light. The light never lets you rest. So every day, you hide deeper in darkness and fog!

And you picked the right time: now the night birds fly. It’s the time for all who fear the light—the evening time when they don’t really rest. I hear it and smell it: their time has come for quiet hunts and processions, not wild hunts, but soft, slow, sneaky prayers—a hunt for easy, simple people. All the traps for hearts are set again!
