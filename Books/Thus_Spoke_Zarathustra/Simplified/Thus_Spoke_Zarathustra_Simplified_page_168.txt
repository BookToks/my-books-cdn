The people who create new things, who break old rules and values, are hated the most. They call these people law-breakers.

Good people can’t create anything new; they always start the end of things. They punish anyone who tries to make new values, and by doing this, they harm the future of all humans.

Good people have always been the start of the end.

My friends, do you understand this? Remember what I said about the "last man"? Who is the biggest threat to the future of humanity? Isn’t it the good and just people?

I ask you, break apart the good and just! Do you understand what I mean?

Are you running away? Are you scared? Does this idea make you shake?

My friends, when I told you to break the good and their rules, I was sending you on a big adventure.

Now comes the real fear, the big challenge, the sickness and dizziness from the journey.

The good gave you false safety and fake hopes; you were born and raised in their lies. Everything has been twisted by the good.

But the one who found the world of "man" also found the world of "man’s future." Now you must be brave and patient sailors with me!

Wake up early, my friends, learn to keep yourselves strong!

The sea is stormy; many will try to pull you down.

The sea is stormy; everything is in the sea. But stay strong! You old sailor-hearts!

What about the homeland? That’s where our direction is, where our children’s future is! In that direction, even stormier than the sea, is our biggest hope!

"Why so hard?" the diamond once asked the charcoal, "aren't we related?" Why so soft? My friends, I ask you: aren’t you my brothers?

Why are you so soft, so quiet and giving? Why is there so much saying no and giving up in your hearts? Why do your eyes show so little strength?

If you won’t be strong and unbreakable, how will you ever win with me?
