What does this pain mean, with sharp, boring arrows?

Why are you looking here, never tired of human suffering, with your mean, god-like angry eyes?

You won’t kill me, but just keep hurting me?

Why do you want to hurt me, you mean, strange God? Ha! Ha!

You sneak up on me in the dark of night… What do you want?

Speak!

You crowd me, push me—Ha! Now way too close!

You hear me breathing, you listen to my heart, you jealous one!

Jealous of what, exactly?

Go away! Go away!

Why the ladder?

Do you want to climb in?

Climb into my heart?

Climb into my most secret thoughts?

Shameless one! You stranger! Thief!

What are you looking for by sneaking around?

What do you want by listening?

What do you want by hurting me?

You torturer!

You hangman-God!

Or should I, like a dog, roll over for you?

And begging, crazy, excited, wag my tail to be friendly?

No use!

Push me more!

Cruelest pusher!

I’m not a dog—you’re just playing a game with me, you cruel hunter!
