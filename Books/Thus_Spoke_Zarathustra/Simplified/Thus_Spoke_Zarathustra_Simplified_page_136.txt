When I shout, "Curse all the scared cowards inside you, who’d rather whine, fold their hands, and worship," they yell back, "Zarathustra has no god." Especially their teachers who teach people to obey shout this. But I love to shout back in their ears, "Yes! I am Zarathustra, the godless!" Those teachers who want everyone to obey! They sneak around wherever there's someone weak or sick like lice. I’m so grossed out by them that I want to crush them.

Well! This is my message for them: I am Zarathustra, the godless, who says, "Who’s more godless than me, so I can learn from him?" I am Zarathustra, the godless: where can I find someone like me? And all those who follow their own will and refuse to obey are my equals.

I am Zarathustra, the godless! I try every chance I get. Only when it’s fully ready do I accept it as my food.

Many chances have come to me, demanding my attention. But even more strongly, my own will told them what to do. Then those chances begged me, kneeling, saying nicely, "Look, Zarathustra, friends only come to friends!" But why do I talk when no one listens? So I’ll shout it to the wind: You small people keep getting smaller! You comfortable ones will break apart and die—because of your many little good deeds, your many little avoidances, and your many little surrenders!

Your soil is too soft and weak! But for a tree to grow big, it needs to wrap strong roots around hard rocks!

Even what you leave out helps build the future; your nothingness is like a spider web that feeds on the future’s blood.

And when you take, it’s like stealing, you little do-gooders; but even thieves know that "you only steal if you can’t rob." Saying "It gives itself" is just another way to make people obey. But I tell you, you comfortable ones, it will keep taking more and more from you!

Oh, if only you would give up being half-hearted and choose doing nothing just like you choose doing something!

Oh, if only you understood my words: "Always do what you want—but first be the kind of person who can truly want."
