Back then, I loved those beautiful girls from the East and the other bright, peaceful places in the sky where there are no clouds or worries.

You wouldn’t believe how nicely they sat when they weren’t dancing—deep but empty-headed, like little secrets or wrapped-up puzzles, like sweet treats. They were colorful and strange, but without any sadness. These puzzles could be figured out. To impress these girls, I even wrote a song to sing after dinner. This is what the traveler, who called himself Zarathustra’s shadow, said. Before anyone could answer, he grabbed the old magician’s harp, crossed his legs, and looked around calmly and wisely. But he also sniffed the air slowly and carefully, like someone trying new air in a strange place. Then he started to sing with a loud voice.

The deserts are growing: beware if you try to hide them!

-Ha!

Serious!

Really serious!

A strong start!

Like something from Africa, serious!

Like a lion’s roar, or maybe a howling monkey—but it doesn’t matter to you, kind girls I love so much, who let me sit at your feet for the first time, a European under the palm trees. Selah.

Amazing, really!

Here I am sitting now, so close to the desert, but still far from it, not yet alone. Instead, I’m stuck in this tiny oasis—it opened wide like a big, beautiful mouth, smelling so sweet. Then I fell right in, right down, right among you, kind girls I love so much!
