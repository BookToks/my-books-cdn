Do you want to find your true self? Wait a little and listen to me.

People say, "If you look for yourself, you might get lost. Being alone is wrong." You used to believe that too.

Their voices still ring in your head. And when you say, "I don’t share your feelings anymore," it hurts you.

That pain comes from the same feelings you used to share; it’s the last sign of that connection.

But if you want to follow your pain to find yourself, then show me you have the power to do it!

Are you strong and in control? Can you start new things? Are you like a wheel rolling by itself? Can you even make stars move around you?

There are so many people who just want to be great and powerful! Show me you’re not just like them!

There are many big ideas that do nothing but blow up and leave you emptier.

You say you’re free? I want to hear what controls you, not just that you broke free from something.

Are you really someone who should be free? Many have lost their worth when they gave up being controlled.

Free from what? That doesn’t matter to me. What matters is: free for what?

Can you give yourself what’s good and bad? Can you make your own rules and follow them? Can you judge yourself and punish yourself if needed?

Being alone with your own judge and punisher is scary.

It’s like a star thrown out into empty space, cold and alone.

Today, you still feel pain from the crowd, but you’re still brave and hopeful.

But one day, being alone will tire you out; your pride will fade, and your courage will weaken. You’ll cry out: "I am alone!"

One day, you won’t see your greatness anymore; you’ll only see your smallness. Even your own greatness will scare you like a ghost.
