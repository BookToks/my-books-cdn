Even a year later, Gast said, "He didn’t look very sick. I almost thought his mental problems were just him acting silly like he used to do with close friends." Gast could tell he didn’t want to get better: "It seemed—terrible as it is—like Nietzsche was pretending to be crazy, and maybe he was happy it ended that way." This matched what Overbeck felt when he visited Jena in February: "I can’t shake the terrible feeling that his madness is fake."

His mind and body kept getting worse, leaving him helpless and unable to write clearly.

On August 25, 1900, Nietzsche died.
