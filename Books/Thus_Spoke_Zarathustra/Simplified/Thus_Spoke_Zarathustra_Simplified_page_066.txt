You should go away now, and be alone! That’s what I want.  

Really, I’m telling you: leave me, and watch out for Zarathustra! Even better: be ashamed of him! Maybe he tricked you.  

A smart person needs to be able to love their enemies and also hate their friends.  

You don’t do a teacher a favor by just staying a student. So why won’t you take my crown?  

You respect me, but what if one day that respect disappears? Be careful that a statue doesn’t crush you!  

You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what difference does Zarathustra make! You are my followers—but what difference do all followers make!  

You hadn’t found yourselves yet when you found me. That’s how all believers are; so belief isn’t very important.  

Now I tell you to lose me and find yourselves; only after you’ve all turned away from me will I come back to you.  

My friends, then I will look for my lost ones with new eyes and love you in a different way.  

You will become my friends again, and children of one hope; then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great noontime with you.  

This great noontime is when humans are halfway between being animals and becoming something better, and they celebrate moving forward as their biggest hope—it’s the start of a new day.  

At that time, the person who is moving forward will feel proud to be going beyond, and the sun of their knowledge will be at its highest point.  

“All the old gods are dead: now we want the overman to live.” Let this be our last wish at the great noontime! So said Zarathustra.
