No. With Nietzsche (Ecce Homo, Preface, Section 2), I don’t believe in “ideals” that take us to some “higher level.” Trying to reach an ideal is kind of silly. There isn’t a ranking of happiness or suffering, just an almost endless mix of different kinds of happiness and suffering. Your spirit, which changes you without effort, will decide how the idea of eternal recurrence affects you.

There are better types of people, the ones who aren’t neurotic, but they show up because of fate, not because they choose or try hard. Actually, having ideals, making choices, and trying hard are signs of being neurotic.

Nietzsche’s ideas about eugenics were a big mistake. People are too dumb to use eugenics to make a better species. If they followed their “ideals,” they might try to stop people with low SAT math scores from having kids, not realizing that being good at math isn’t the most useful kind of intelligence. They might try to get rid of the “gene for aggression” so everyone would be peaceful and orderly but also boring. Trying to “make the world better” is pretty funny.

No Ideals? Does This Mean We Value Nothing?

We always create value in the world, every moment, by what we do or don’t do. Life is like a dance of giving value. Putting value on things is the joy of life—it is life itself. But this only happens right now, in the moment, not in some fantasy about eternal “values,” “ideas,” or “ideals.” When someone talks at a political or religious meeting, it’s to inspire the real people there. They often use fantasies, but it’s the energy in the people’s bodies that makes the speaker excited. The fact that ideals come and go, that we argue about them, and that different groups have opposite ideals shows they aren’t “eternal” and never will be. There’s always a back-and-forth between believing and not believing, and we can’t stop dancing between them. The eternal “will to laughter” is always shining through.
