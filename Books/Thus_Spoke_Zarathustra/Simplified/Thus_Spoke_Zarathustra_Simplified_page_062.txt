Sometimes feelings come first, and other times the spirit does. Some people grow old too fast, but others stay young for a long time.

For many, life feels like a failure; something inside them eats away at their heart.

So, they should make sure that when they die, they do it well.

Many people never become kind or good; they spoil even when things are good. It’s fear that keeps them stuck where they are.

Too many live too long, just hanging on. I wish a storm would come and shake all the bad stuff off the tree!

I wish there were people who talked about dying quickly! That would be like a storm shaking the tree of life! But all I hear is about slow death and being patient with everything “earthly.” Really? You want people to be patient with the earth? The earth is being way too patient with you!

That Hebrew guy they honor by talking about slow death died too early, and that caused problems for many.

He only knew sadness and the pain of his people, plus the hate from good and honest folks — the Hebrew Jesus. That’s why he wanted to die.

If only he had stayed alone in the wilderness, far from everyone!

Maybe then he would have learned how to live, to love the earth, and to laugh too!

Believe me, friends! He died too soon; if he had lived my age, he might have changed his ideas. He was brave enough to change his mind!

But he wasn’t ready yet. Young people love and hate in a way that isn’t mature. His soul and spirit were still limited and awkward.

There is more childlike wonder in grown men than in youth, and less sadness; they understand life and death better.

He who is ready to die, and free in death; who says no when it’s too late to say yes — that’s how he understands life and death.

I hope your dying won’t shame people or the earth, my friends; I ask this from the sweetness inside you.

When you die, your spirit and goodness should still shine like the glow of the evening sky around the earth; otherwise, your dying wasn’t good enough.

I will die like that too, so my friends will love the earth more because of me; and I will become earth again, to rest in the place that made me.

Zarathustra had a goal; he threw his ball.
