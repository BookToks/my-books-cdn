Your ancestors weren’t led by some Holy Spirit into promised lands, and I don’t admire that story. Because where the worst thing ever happened—the cross—there is nothing to celebrate! And wherever this "Holy Spirit" sent its knights on missions, strange and silly people always came first! My friends, don’t look back at your old glory, but look ahead!

You will be strangers in all your old homelands and your ancestors’ lands!

You should love the land your children will live in: let this love be your new pride, something unknown even in the farthest seas! That’s why I tell you to keep searching and exploring!

You will make up for being the children of your fathers by caring for your children: this way, you will fix all the past! I give you this new promise!

Why live? Some say life is pointless! Living is like beating straw or burning yourself without getting warm. This old idea still passes as "wisdom" just because it’s old and smells musty. Even mold gets respect sometimes. Kids might say this because they avoid fire—it burned them! There’s a lot of childishness in old wise books.

And if someone is always "beating straw," why should they complain about it? Such a fool should be quiet!

These people come to the table with nothing, not even hunger, and then complain: "Everything is pointless!" But eating and drinking well, my friends, is definitely not pointless! Let’s break up the tables of those who never find joy!

People say, "To the clean, everything is clean." But I say: To pigs, everything looks dirty!

That’s why dreamers and sad people say, "The world itself is a dirty monster." These people have unclean spirits, especially those who can’t find peace unless they think about an afterlife!
