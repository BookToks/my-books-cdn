And even you, I will harshly punish with my anger!

Like a shout and a cheer, I will travel across wide seas until I find the Happy Isles where my friends stay; and my enemies are there too! Now, I love everyone I can talk to! Even my enemies are part of my happiness.

And when I want to ride my wildest horse, my spear always helps me get on: it’s like a ready helper for my foot. The spear I throw at my enemies! I am thankful to my enemies because I finally get to throw it!

My feelings have been too intense: between flashes of lightning, I will send hailstorms down deep.

My heart will heave violently; it will blow a storm over the mountains: that’s how I calm down.

Really, my happiness and freedom come like a storm! But my enemies will think it’s something evil roaring above them.

Yes, you too, my friends, will be scared by my wild wisdom; maybe you will run away from it, just like my enemies.

Oh, if only I knew how to bring you back with soft shepherd’s flutes! Oh, if my fierce wisdom could roar gently! We’ve already learned so much from each other!

My wild wisdom grew lonely on the mountains; on the hard stones she gave birth to her youngest child.

Now she runs foolishly in the dry desert, looking and looking for soft grass—my old, wild wisdom!

On the soft grass of your hearts, my friends!—on your love, she would rather rest her dearest one! This is what Zarathustra said.

In the Happy Isles, figs fall from the trees, sweet and good; when they fall, their red skins break. I am like a north wind for ripe figs.

So, like figs, these teachings fall for you, my friends: drink their juice and enjoy their sweetness! It is autumn all around, with clear skies and afternoon light.

Look at how full everything is around us! And from all this plenty, it’s wonderful to look out at the faraway seas.

People once said “God” when they looked at distant seas; now, I have taught you to say “overman.”
