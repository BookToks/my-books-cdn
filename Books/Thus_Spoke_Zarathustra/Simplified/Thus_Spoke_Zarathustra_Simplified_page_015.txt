Everyone laughed at Zarathustra. But the tightrope walker thought Zarathustra’s words were for him and started his act.

Zarathustra looked at the crowd and thought deeply. Then he said: People are like a rope stretched between animals and something greater called the overman—a rope hanging over a deep gap.

Crossing this rope is risky. It’s dangerous to move forward, to look back, to shake, or to stop.

What’s amazing about people is that they are a bridge, not the final goal. What’s lovable about people is that they keep moving forward and back.

I admire those who don’t know how to live except by going down, because they are moving beyond.

I admire those who look down on things but secretly respect them—they are like arrows aiming for a better place.

I admire those who don’t look for reasons beyond the stars to sacrifice themselves, but give themselves to the earth so that the overman can come one day.

I admire those who live to learn, and learn so the overman can live someday. This is how they accept their own going down.

I admire those who work and create, building a home for the overman, getting the earth, animals, and plants ready—this is their way of going down.

I admire those who love their good qualities, because virtue means wanting to go down and reach beyond.

I admire those who give all their spirit to their virtue, walking like a spirit over the bridge.

I admire those who make their virtue their passion and fate. For their virtue, they are ready to keep living or stop living.

I admire those who don’t want too many virtues. One strong virtue is better than two, because it ties you tighter to your fate.

I admire those whose soul gives everything away, who want no thanks and don’t keep anything for themselves. They always give and don’t try to save themselves.

I admire those who feel bad when luck is on their side and ask themselves, “Am I cheating?”
