I have been here from the very start, guiding and teaching. I once told myself, "Become who you really are!" Now, people can come to me. I’m still waiting for the right time to step down and join others, but I’m not there yet.

So, I wait here on these high mountains, clever and a bit proud. I’m not impatient or patient anymore—I’ve even forgotten how to be patient because I don’t suffer like before. Maybe my fate has forgotten me, or maybe it’s hiding, just wasting time.

Actually, I don’t mind my fate because it doesn’t rush me. It gives me time to have fun and be playful. That’s why today I climbed this high mountain to catch fish.

Has anyone ever tried to catch fish on a mountain? It might seem silly, but it’s better than being stuck down below, waiting and getting angry or upset. I don’t want to be one of those who shout angrily from the mountains, threatening people. But I don’t hate those angry people—they’re funny to me! They have to be impatient now, making noise while they can.

Me and my fate don’t worry about the present or the future. We have all the time in the world to talk and wait.

One day, something big will happen and it can’t be missed. It’s about a great, far-off human kingdom, the kingdom of Zarathustra that will last a thousand years. It might seem very far away, but I’m sure of it. I stand firm on this strong, eternal mountain where all the winds come, asking, “Where?”
