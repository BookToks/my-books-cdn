He hadn’t walked very far when a man quietly came up to him and whispered in his ear—it was the fool from the tower. "Leave this town, Zarathustra," he said, "lots of people here hate you. The good and fair people hate you and call you their enemy; the true believers hate you and say you’re dangerous. You were lucky they just laughed at you because you sounded foolish. It was also lucky you were with the dead dog. By making a fool of yourself, you saved your life today. But leave this town, or tomorrow I’ll jump over your body like a living man over a dead one." After saying this, the fool disappeared. Zarathustra kept walking through the dark streets.

At the town gate, the gravediggers met him. They shone their torch on his face and, seeing it was Zarathustra, they mocked him a lot.

"Zarathustra is carrying the dead dog away! Look at him, a grave-digger now! Our hands are too clean for this job. Will Zarathustra steal from the devil? Good luck with that! But the devil is a better thief than Zarathustra. He’ll take both of you and eat you both!" They laughed and whispered together.

Zarathustra didn’t say anything and kept going. After walking for two hours through forests and swamps, he heard wolves howling and felt hungry. So he stopped at a lonely house with a light inside.

"Hunger hits me like a robber," Zarathustra said. "In these forests and swamps, hunger comes for me late at night. My hunger is strange—it often shows up after I’ve eaten, and today it didn’t come at all. Where was it?" Then Zarathustra knocked on the door. An old man came out carrying a light and asked, "Who comes to me and my bad sleep?" "A living man and a dead one," Zarathustra said. "Give me something to eat and drink—I forgot to do that during the day. They say if you feed 20 hungry people, it refreshes your own soul. That’s wisdom."
