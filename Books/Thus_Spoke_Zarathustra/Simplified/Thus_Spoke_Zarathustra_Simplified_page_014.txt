Doing bad things to the Earth is now the worst kind of wrong, and it’s crazy to respect something unknown more than the Earth itself!

A long time ago, people’s souls looked down on their bodies, thinking the body should be thin, ugly, and starving. They wanted to get away from their bodies and the Earth.

But that soul was actually thin, ugly, and starving too; it wanted to be cruel!

And you, my friends, tell me: What does your body say about your soul? Is your soul poor, dirty, and just barely okay?

People are like dirty streams. You have to be like a big sea to take in a dirty stream without getting dirty yourself.

Look, I’m teaching you about the overman: he is like that sea; he lets your great hate flow past and disappear.

What’s your biggest feeling? It’s the moment of great hate.

The moment when even your happiness feels gross, and even your reason and goodness.

The moment when you say: “What’s the point of my happiness? It’s poor, dirty, and barely okay. But my happiness should make life worth living!” The moment when you say: “What’s the point of my reason? Does it want knowledge like a lion wants food? No, it’s poor, dirty, and barely okay!” The moment when you say: “What’s the point of my good qualities? They haven’t made me passionate. I’m tired of being good and bad! It’s all poor, dirty, and barely okay!” The moment when you say: “What’s the point of being fair and right? I don’t feel like fire and heat. But fairness and rightness are fire and heat.” The moment when you say: “What’s the point of my pity? Isn’t pity the cross that someone who loves people is nailed to? But my pity isn’t like that.” Have you ever felt or said things like this? Oh!

I wish I could hear you say these things!

It’s not your sin that screams to the sky – it’s how small and cheap your sin is that screams.

Where is the lightning to hit you? Where is the wildness that should shock you?

Look, I’m teaching you about the overman: he is that lightning, he is that wildness.

When Zarathustra finished speaking, someone in the crowd shouted: “We’ve heard enough about the tightrope walker; now let’s actually see him!”
