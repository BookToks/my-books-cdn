He really didn’t like the boring parts of teaching and researching. He wanted to write books, but most other scholars didn’t like them at all. At first, they harshly criticized his ideas and writing style, and later they just ignored him completely. Still, he got along well with his university bosses. After ten years, he stopped working because of health problems and got a pension that was two-thirds of his salary. He spent the rest of his clear-minded life traveling and writing.

His friendship with Wagner ended badly for different reasons. He loved a very interesting girl named Lou Salome, who was younger and wanted to stay independent. He was close to his sister until she ruined his friendship with Lou and later married a man who hated Jews and caused trouble. His loyal helper Peter Gast was there for him, but sadly, he wasn’t the kind of friend Nietzsche needed to inspire him. In his last clear year, he finally felt like he was becoming famous when a well-known Danish writer, Georg Brandes, praised him a lot. Nietzsche started writing an autobiography, but while finishing it, he went insane for reasons no one really understands.

Most of Nietzsche’s books after 1876 are made up of aphorisms. These are short statements or ideas, sometimes just one sentence, sometimes a few paragraphs, each about one topic or observation. Sometimes these aphorisms connect, sometimes they don’t. Each one can stand alone.

This is true for books like Human All Too Human, The Dawn, The Gay Science, and Zarathustra. Even Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols, and The Antichrist use this style a lot. The aphorisms jump around many subjects and themes throughout his work. None of his books focus on just one theme—you could think of them as a big mix of ideas. Even his later books that focus more on one topic, like The Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo, still have many striking aphorisms. The ancient pre-Socratic philosophers also used short, separate sayings to explain the world. Aristotle was the first to explain things in an organized way, and most philosophers have followed that since. Nietzsche’s return to this random style of aphorisms is what makes his work so special, challenging, and powerful.

If “understanding” means the usual kind of getting everything clear, then I don’t “understand” Nietzsche.
