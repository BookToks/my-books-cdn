Thomas Common made a mistake by using biblical language when translating this book. This shows what many readers don’t get: Zarathustra is kind of a funny character, like a joke about prophets. He is one of the “wise people who find happiness again in their foolishness” [Prologue (1)]. He doesn’t want “followers” or “believers.”

When he leaves the people who have been following him, he says, “all believers; so all faith is worth very little… Now I tell you to stop following me and find yourselves; only when you have all denied me will I come back to you.”

The book The Dawn (1880), which came before The Gay Science, is like that book but not as mature or lively.

The Twilight of the Idols (1888) and The Antichrist (1888) were written in a very energetic time near the end of his life when he felt he was becoming famous.

In Beyond Good and Evil (1886) and Genealogy of Morals (1887), Nietzsche changed his style to sound more like university books. That’s why modern professors like these two books more than his others. In his autobiography, he said, “… From then on [after Zarathustra] all my writings are like fish hooks … If no fish were caught, it’s not my fault. There were no fish …” 

Even today, 123 years later, there are still no fish in university culture. But professors still say they are the best at “explaining” Nietzsche to the rest of us.
