Look, there’s the way to my cave. Be my guest tonight. Talk to my animals about how happy they are—until I come back home. Right now, a cry for help is calling me away quickly. Also, if you find some new honey with me, cold and golden, eat it!

But now, you have to say goodbye to your cows, even if it’s hard. They are your closest friends and teachers! "Except one, who I love even more," said the beggar. "You are good, Zarathustra, even better than a cow!" "Stop it, you flatterer!" Zarathustra said with a smile. "Why do you spoil me with such sweet talk—like honey?"

"Go away from me!" he said again and swung his stick at the beggar, who quickly ran off.

No sooner had the beggar left than Zarathustra heard a new voice behind him: "Wait! Zarathustra! It’s me, your shadow!" But Zarathustra didn’t stop. He felt annoyed by all the people crowding his mountains. "Where has my loneliness gone?" he asked.

"This is too much for me; the mountains are full of people. My kingdom feels like it’s not part of this world anymore. I need new mountains."

"My shadow is calling me? Who cares about my shadow! Let it chase me—I’m running away from it." Zarathustra said this to himself and ran. But his shadow followed, so soon there were three runners: first the beggar, then Zarathustra, and finally his shadow.

After a while, Zarathustra realized he was being silly. He shook off his irritation and anger.

"What!" he said, "haven’t the weirdest things always happened to us old hermits and saints?"

"Yes, my foolishness has grown big in these mountains! Now I hear the sound of six old fool’s legs running one after another!"
