I used to feel happy and forget myself, seeing the world as a kind of wild joy.

The world always seemed imperfect to me, full of contradictions, like a messy but joyful creation by an imperfect creator.

I once believed there was something beyond humans, like many people who believe in an afterlife. But really, was there anything beyond us?

No, my friends, the god I imagined was made by humans and was a kind of madness, just like all gods!

This god was human, just a small part of a human and their ego. It came from my own feelings and thoughts, not from anywhere beyond.

What happened, friends? I grew beyond my old self, the one who suffered; I carried my pain up a mountain and found a brighter hope. Then, that imagined god faded away.

Now, as someone healing, it would hurt and shame me to believe in such made-up gods. That’s what I want to say to people who believe in an afterlife.

It was suffering and feeling powerless that made people create all these afterlives; and the brief crazy happiness felt only by those who suffer the most.

It was tiredness, wanting to reach the end quickly, like wanting to die; a tiredness that didn’t even want to try anymore, that made all gods and afterlives.

Trust me, friends! It was the body that lost hope in itself, and the confused spirit tried to reach beyond the limits.

Trust me, friends! It was the body that gave up on the earth it lived on and heard the deep call of life.

The body wanted to break through these limits, not just with the mind, into "another world." But that "other world" is hidden from humans; it’s a cold emptiness, and life only speaks to us as humans.

It’s really hard to prove and explain existence. Tell me, friends, isn’t the strangest thing also the clearest?

Yes, this “I,” with all its confusion and contradictions, honestly shows what it is – this creating, wanting, and valuing self that measures everything.

And this honest self, the “I,” talks about the body and still wants the body, even when it dreams and struggles like a broken bird.
