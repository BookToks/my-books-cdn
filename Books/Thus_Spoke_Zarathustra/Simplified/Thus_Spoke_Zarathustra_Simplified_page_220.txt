Even if you think you're better and smarter, a lot of you is still messed up and strange. No blacksmith in the world could fix you to be perfect for me.

You are just bridges: higher people will walk over you! You are like steps: so don’t be mad at someone who climbs higher than you!

Maybe one day, someone really good and true will come from you—someone who can be my real son and heir. But that time is far away. You aren’t the ones who deserve my name and legacy.

I’m not waiting for you here in these mountains; I won’t come down with you for the last time. You came to me only as a sign that better people are coming—Not those full of big feelings or tired of life or what you call the leftover of God; No! No! Three times no! I’m waiting for others here in these mountains, and I won’t leave without them—stronger, higher, more joyful people, who are solid in body and soul: laughing lions must come!

Oh my guests, you strange ones—haven’t you heard about my children? That they are on their way to me?

Please talk to me about my gardens, my Happy Isles, my new beautiful race—why don’t you talk about them?

I want the gift of your love right now, that you speak to me about my children. I am rich because of them, and I became poor for them: I gave up so much.

I would give up anything to have just one thing: these children, this living garden, these life-trees of my will and greatest hope!

Zarathustra spoke like this, then suddenly stopped because he felt a strong longing. He closed his eyes and mouth, his heart full of emotion. All his guests were silent and still, confused—except the old soothsayer, who made signs with his hands.

At that moment, the soothsayer interrupted Zarathustra’s greeting and his guests. He stepped forward quickly, grabbed Zarathustra’s hand, and said, “But Zarathustra!”
