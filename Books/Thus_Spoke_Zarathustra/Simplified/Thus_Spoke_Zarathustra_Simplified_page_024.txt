The Three Changes

I want to tell you about three big changes the spirit goes through: first, it becomes a camel, then the camel turns into a lion, and finally, the lion changes into a child.

The spirit has to carry a lot of heavy stuff. It’s strong and can handle a lot because it respects these heavy things. 

What does “heavy” mean?
