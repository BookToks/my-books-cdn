"Always one plus one makes two in the end!" Me and myself are always talking seriously: how could we handle it without a friend?

The hermit's friend is always the third person: the third person is like a cork that stops the conversation between the two from sinking too deep.

Ah! There are too many deep thoughts for all hermits. That’s why they really want a friend to lift them up.

We trust others because we don’t fully trust ourselves. Wanting a friend shows what we’re really feeling inside.

Sometimes, we use love just to get past jealousy. And sometimes we fight and make enemies to hide that we’re actually hurt.

"At least be my enemy!" — this is true respect that’s too shy to ask for friendship.

If you want a friend, you have to be ready to fight for them. And to fight, you have to be okay with being an enemy sometimes.

You should still respect the enemy in your friend. Can you be close to your friend without challenging them?

Your best enemy should be your friend. You’re closest to them when you stand up to them.

Would you go without clothes in front of your friend? You show yourself as you really are to honor them? But your friend might still wish you were gone because of that!

Someone who shows everything about themselves can shock others: that’s why you should be afraid to be too open! If you were gods, you might be ashamed of wearing clothes!

You can never dress up enough for your friend, because to them you should be like an arrow and a hope to be better.

Have you ever seen your friend sleeping — to know what they really look like? What does your friend’s face usually look like? It’s like your own face, but a little rough and not perfect.

Have you ever seen your friend asleep? Weren’t you shocked to see them like that? Oh my friend, people are something we always have to get better than.
