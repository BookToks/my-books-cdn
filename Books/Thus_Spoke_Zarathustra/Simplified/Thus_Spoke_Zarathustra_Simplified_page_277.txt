Every time we get in a car instead of walking, running, or dancing… every time we cover up symptoms with medicine or use antibiotics too much… every time we use big university ideas on our local problems instead of really looking at them… every time we choose fake stories from movies and TV instead of the real fun with people close to us… every day we live in clean, controlled places like houses, offices, and stores… our bodies get a little weaker and a little less smart. People thinking they have all the power is kind of funny. After many generations of this, our bodies will become very weak and fragile. We will have wasted the strength our bodies built over 2 billion years without technology. Maybe it’s time for life to create something new.

The greatest power in the universe is the "butterfly effect." Whether you wave your hand to the right or left will change the lives of every person on Earth 500 years from now and forever. This power is infinite but also kind of useless in a funny way.

Is There Proof of Eternal Recurrence?

No, not really. No one outside can watch and check what happens after many years until it happens twice. God, who might do this, is too busy trying to prove that he exists.

Nietzsche tried to prove it logically but never fully believed in his own proofs enough to share them.

My "proof" comes from experience. It’s a feeling that life and awareness are solid and real. Here’s a paradox: If death is real, why are we so calm? If death isn’t real, why are we so nervous?

There’s a balance here. The idea of personal extinction forever would be too scary and would stop us from living. Yes, death is real. When we almost get in a car crash, our body’s adrenaline shows us that. But the final extinction that people feared 40,000 years ago isn’t forever.

It lasts a very, very long time, but it’s not eternal. The world as it is now will come back again.
