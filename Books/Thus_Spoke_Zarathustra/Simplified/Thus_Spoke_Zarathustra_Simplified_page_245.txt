Is your soul too pure for this praying and the smoke from those worshippers?" "There is something about it," said the careful one, touching his nose, "there’s something in this scene that even makes my conscience feel better.

Maybe I’m afraid to believe in God, but it’s true that God seems most believable in this way.

God is said to be eternal, according to the most faithful: someone with unlimited time takes their time. Slow and maybe even a bit foolish, but still able to go very far.

And someone with too much spirit might easily fall in love with foolishness. Think about yourself, Zarathustra!

You, really! Even you could become a fool because you know too much.

Doesn’t a true wise person often choose the most twisted paths? Your own experience shows it, Zarathustra!

"And you," said Zarathustra, turning to the ugliest man lying on the ground, reaching his arm toward the donkey (because he was giving it wine). "Hey, you, what have you been doing?

You look different, your eyes shine, and a special feeling covers your ugliness: what did you do?

Is it true what they say, that you woke him up again? And why? Wasn’t he killed for good reason?

You look like you’ve changed: what did you do? Why did you change your mind? Tell me!" "Oh Zarathustra," said the ugly man, "you’re a trickster!

Whether he’s alive, alive again, or completely dead – which of us really knows best? I ask you.

But one thing I do know – I learned it from you once, Zarathustra: the one who wants to kill deeply laughs.

‘Not with anger but with laughter does one kill’ – that’s what you once said, Zarathustra, you secret one, the calm destroyer, the dangerous holy man – you’re a trickster!"  

Then Zarathustra, surprised by these tricky answers, jumped back to the door of his cave and shouted to all his guests in a loud voice: "Oh you fools, all of you, you clowns! Why do you hide and pretend in front of me!

How your hearts twisted with joy and mischief because you finally became like little kids again – that is, faithful –

Because you finally did what kids do again – you prayed, folded your hands, and said ‘good God’!
