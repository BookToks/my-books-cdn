But now please leave this nursery, my own little cave, where today all the childish stuff happens. Cool down your hot, wild feelings and crazy heart outside here!

For sure: unless you become like little children, you won’t enter the kingdom of heaven." (And Zarathustra pointed up with his hands.) "But we don’t want to go into the kingdom of heaven: we’ve grown up, so we want the kingdom of earth."

And once again Zarathustra started to speak. "Oh my new friends," he said, "you strange, special people, how happy you make me now—since you’re joyful again! You’ve really blossomed: it feels like you need new celebrations just for you.

A little brave silliness, some kind of sacred party or fun festival, some old happy Zarathustra foolishness, some loud person to lift your spirits.

Don’t forget this night and this fun festival, you special people! You came up with it when you were with me, and I take it as a good sign—only people who are healing come up with things like this!

And if you celebrate this festival again, do it out of love for yourselves, and also out of love for me! And to remember me!" That’s what Zarathustra said.

Meanwhile, one by one, everyone went outside into the cool, quiet night; Zarathustra himself held the hand of the ugliest man to show him the night sky, the big round moon, and the shining waterfalls near his cave. They finally stood still next to each other; all were old, but with brave, comforted hearts, surprised that life on earth was so good. The mystery of the night slowly touched their hearts.
