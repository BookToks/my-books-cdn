But now leave, I pray you, this nursery, my own cave, where today all childishness is carried on. Cool down, here outside, your hot child-wantonness and heart-tumult!
 
 To be sure: except you become as little children you shall not enter into that kingdom of heaven." (And Zarathustra pointed aloft with his hands.) "But we do not at all want to enter into the kingdom of heaven: we have become men, - so we want the kingdom of earth." 3.
 
 And once more began Zarathustra to speak. "O my new friends," said he, - "you strange ones, you higher men, how well do you now please me,-Since you have again become joyful! you have, truly, all blossomed forth: it seems to me that for such flowers as you, new festivals are required.
 
 -A little valiant nonsense, some divine service and ass-festival, some old joyful Zarathustra fool, some blusterer to blow your souls bright.
 
 Forget not this night and this ass-festival, you higher men! That did you devise when with me, that do I take as a good omen, - such things only the convalescents devise!
 
 And should you celebrate it again, this ass-festival, do it from love to yourselves, do it also from love to me! And in remembrance of me!" Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 4, (19) THE DRUNKEN SONG 1.
 
 MEANWHILE one after another had gone out into the open air, and into the cool, thoughtful night; Zarathustra himself, however, led the ugliest man by the hand, that he might show him his night-world, and the great round moon, and the silvery water-falls near his cave. There they at last stood still beside one another; all of them old people, but with comforted, brave hearts, and astonished in themselves that it was so well 246 with them on earth; the mystery of the night, however, came closer and closer to their hearts.
