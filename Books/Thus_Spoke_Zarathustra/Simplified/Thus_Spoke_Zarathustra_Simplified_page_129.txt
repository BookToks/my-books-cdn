Each person must be tested to see if they are like me and come from my kind: someone who has a strong will, stays calm even when they talk, and gives in a way that feels like receiving.

That person might one day join me as a friend, a partner in creating and enjoying life with Zarathustra—someone who writes down my wishes for making everything better.

For their sake, and for others like them, I need to improve myself. So now, I avoid happiness and face all kinds of troubles to prove who I really am.

Honestly, it’s time for me to leave; the feeling of being a traveler, boredom, and quiet moments all tell me, “It’s time!” A voice whispered through a crack, “Come!” The door opened just a little and said, “Go!” But I’m stuck because I love my children too much.

My desire to love them traps me, making me lose myself in them.

Wanting things means I’ve lost myself now. I have you, my children! In having you, everything is certain and there’s no more wanting.

But the warm feeling of love was like the sun shining on me, cooking Zarathustra inside. Then doubts and worries passed by.

Now I wanted cold and winter: “Oh, I wish the cold would make me break and crack again!” I sighed—and a cold mist rose from me.

My past, with all its pain, broke free like it was waking up from a deep sleep, though it was hidden like a dead body.

Everything around me gave signs: “It’s time!” But I didn’t listen until finally my deepest thoughts shook me and bit into me.

Oh, deep and dark thoughts, my own thoughts! When will I be strong enough to hear you digging inside me without being scared?

My heart beats so hard it almost chokes me when I hear you digging! Even your silence feels like it could strangle me, you deep silent one!

I’ve never dared to call you out loud before; just carrying you inside me has been enough! I haven’t been strong enough to play wildly and boldly yet.

Your weight has always been too much for me, but one day I will find the strength and the brave voice like a lion to call you out!

When I overcome myself through this, I will also overcome even bigger challenges; that victory will prove I’m truly perfect!
