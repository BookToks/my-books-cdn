I looked into your eyes recently, Life: I saw a golden glow shining in your dark eyes, and my heart stopped because I was so happy. I saw a shiny golden boat floating on dark water, moving and blinking like it was alive.

When I danced wildly, you gave me a quick, laughing look that made me wonder. You shook your little hands twice, and then my feet moved even faster with excitement. My heels lifted up, my toes listened carefully—you know dancers can feel with their toes!

I jumped toward you, but you pulled away, your hair flying around like it was running from me.

I jumped away from you and your twisting hair. Then you stood there, turned halfway, with a gentle look in your eyes.

With sneaky looks, you teach me sneaky moves; I learn to dance cleverly on tricky paths.

I’m scared when you’re close, but I love you when you’re far away. You run from me, but that makes me want you more. I suffer because of you, but I would gladly do anything for you.

For you, whose coldness burns me, whose hate confuses me, whose running away traps me, whose teasing begs me—Who wouldn’t hate you, you great temptress, wild and free, always searching and finding! Who wouldn’t love you, you innocent, impatient, fast-moving, child-like sinner!

Where are you pulling me now, you perfect mix of wild and sweet? And now you trick me by running away; you playful trouble!

I dance after you, following even the smallest signs, all alone. Where are you? Give me your hand! Or even just your finger!

There are caves and thick bushes here—we might get lost! Stop! Stay still! Don’t you see owls and bats flying around in a chaotic fight?

You bat! You owl! You want to trick me? Where did you learn to bark and howl like dogs?

You bite me gently with your little white teeth; your evil eyes stare at me, and your curly hair hides underneath!

This is a dance over rocks and stones: I am the hunter—will you be my dog, or maybe my mountain goat?
