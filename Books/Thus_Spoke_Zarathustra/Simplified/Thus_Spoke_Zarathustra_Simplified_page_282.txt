Could This Be Used by Bullies to Justify Being Mean?

Yes. But they would have to keep the idea secret from the people they’re hurting.

“Riding your spirit” might actually mean having a strong and lasting feeling of rebellion.

What’s the Opposite of the Sadness of Dying?

Right after dying, there’s an amazing rush of life, happiness, and energy, like a baby being born.

Loved Ones

All my life, I’ve liked times when I feel sad. It feels important, both painful and sweet. But I’m not sure how it fits with the idea that we live forever and come back again, because you never really say “goodbye” to the people you love. You just say “see you in 30 years” or “see you soon.”

Maybe animals are right. They never cry much. Their grieving seems really short or doesn’t happen at all.

Waking Up to Your Kids

Rules about right and wrong can be silly and harmful. You won’t “save” your kids in any way. Your real job is to keep them safe with food and shelter, let them have a childhood (mostly by leaving them alone), and enjoy spending time with them as much as you can, since you’ll be with them forever. Until everyone else around you stops fighting over religion or what’s right (which might never happen), you’ll have to quietly protect your kids from others.

When all the fake rules disappear, you just watch these amazing and magical little people. If you still have some fun in your heart, you can play with them, and that’s the best happiness life can give.

Eternal Recurrence Gives You Bravery.

The life you live goes on forever, repeating itself again and again.
