But then my enemies stole my nights and made me suffer without sleep. Where did that happy wisdom go?

I once hoped for good luck, but you showed me something scary and strange like an owl-monster. Where did my gentle hope go?

I promised to give up all hate, but you turned my closest friends into painful problems. Where did my strongest promise go?

I once walked blindly on a good path, but you threw dirt on that path. Now I hate the way I used to walk.

When I worked hard and won, the people who loved me said I made them sad the most.

It was always because of you: you made my sweetest moments bitter and ruined my hard work.

You always sent the rudest beggars to my kindness; you surrounded my sympathy with shameless people. You hurt my trust in being good.

When I gave my best in sacrifice, your so-called "goodness" added its greedy gifts, making my pure offering die in their smoke.

I once wanted to dance like never before, reaching beyond the skies. But you tricked my favorite musician.

Now he plays a sad, terrible song; sadly, he blew a mournful horn right into my ear!

Evil musician, tool of harm, the most innocent tool!

I was ready for the best dance, but you killed my joy with your music!

Only in dance can I express the deepest meanings—now my greatest message stays silent in my body!

My highest hope stays unspoken and unrealized! All the dreams and comforts of my youth have died!

How did I survive all this? How did I heal from such wounds? How did my soul rise up again?

Yes, something strong and unbreakable stays with me, something that could even break rocks: it’s called my Will. It moves quietly and never changes over the years.

My old Will will keep going on my feet; it is tough and cannot be destroyed.
