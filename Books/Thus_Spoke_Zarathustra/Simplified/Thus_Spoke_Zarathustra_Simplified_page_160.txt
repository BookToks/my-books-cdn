"You shall not steal! You shall not kill!"—these rules used to be called sacred. People used to respect them deeply, bowing down and taking off their shoes.

But I ask you: Where have the worst thieves and killers ever been found—if not among those who claimed these rules were holy?

Isn't there stealing and killing everywhere in life? And if these rules are called holy, doesn't that mean truth itself has been killed?

Or was it a lesson of death that called holy what goes against life? Oh my friends, break the old rules for me!

I feel sorry for the past because it’s been left behind—forgotten by every new generation that changes the meaning of everything to make it useful for themselves.

A powerful leader could come along and twist all the past to serve their own purpose, turning it into just a tool or a signal for their plans.

But this is another problem I worry about: ordinary people think only about their grandparents, and with their grandparents, time seems to stop.

So the past gets abandoned, because maybe one day the common people will take control and drown all history in shallow, easy times.

That’s why, my friends, we need a new kind of nobility—a group strong against both the rulers and the crowd, who will write the word “noble” again on fresh tablets.

We need many noble people, many different kinds, for this new nobility! Or like I once said in a story: "It’s like having many gods but no one single God!"

My friends, I dedicate you to this new nobility: you should become creators and growers and planters for the future—not a nobility you can buy like traders buying gold, because anything you can buy is not worth much.

Don’t be proud of where you come from anymore, but where you are going! Let your will and your steps that push you forward be your new honor!

Not because you served a prince—princes don’t matter now!—or because you helped keep things the way they are.

Not because your family learned to be fancy at court, standing around all day like a flamingo in shallow water. (Because courtiers think standing still is a skill and that after death, their reward is just to be allowed to sit down!)
