There’s one more thing I know: I’m standing now at my final challenge, the one I’ve been waiting for the longest. This is my hardest path to climb! I’ve started my loneliest journey!

But someone like me doesn’t run away from this moment. This is the moment that says: Now you’re on the path to becoming great!

The highest point and the deepest drop are now together!

You’re going toward your greatness: what was once your biggest danger is now your last safe place!

You’re going toward your greatness: you have to be brave now because there’s no way back!

You’re going toward your greatness: no one can follow you here.

Your foot has erased the path behind you, and it says: No going back.

And if all other ways fail, you have to learn to rise by yourself: how else can you go up?

You have to rise above yourself and your feelings! Now the softest part of you must become the strongest.

Someone who’s always spoiled themselves will eventually feel sick from it. I admire what makes you strong! I don’t praise a place where everything is easy and sweet.

You need to learn to look away from yourself to see many things clearly. This kind of toughness is needed by every mountain climber.

But if you only look at what’s right in front of you, how can you see anything deeper?

But you, Zarathustra, want to see the whole truth, the ground and what’s behind everything: so you must climb even higher — above yourself — up, up, until even the stars are below you!

Yes! Looking down on myself and even on my stars — that’s the real peak for me, my last summit!

Zarathustra said these things to himself as he climbed, trying to encourage his heart with tough ideas because he was more upset than ever before. When he reached the top of the mountain ridge, he saw the other sea spread out below him. He stood still and was quiet for a long time. The night was cold up there, but the sky was clear and full of stars.

“I know my fate,” he finally said sadly. “Well! I’m ready. Now my last loneliness begins.”

Oh, this dark, sad sea below me! Oh, this sad, restless night!
