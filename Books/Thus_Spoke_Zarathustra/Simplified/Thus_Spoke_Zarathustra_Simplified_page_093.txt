I want you to understand my story about good and evil, so first I’ll tell you my story about life and what all living things are like.

I followed living things everywhere; I walked on wide roads and narrow paths to learn what they are really like.

With a special mirror, I caught their look when they didn’t speak, so their eyes could talk to me. And their eyes did speak.

But wherever I found living things, I also heard something else: they all follow orders. All living things obey.

Then I learned this: if something can’t obey itself, it has to be told what to do.

That’s just how living things work.

The third thing I learned is that telling others what to do is harder than obeying. Not just because the leader has to carry the weight of everyone following, which can crush them.

To me, leading felt like trying something risky; whenever a living thing leads, it risks itself.

Even when it leads itself, it has to face the consequences. It becomes the judge, punisher, and victim of its own rules.

I wondered, how does this happen? What makes a living thing obey, lead, and even obey while leading?

Listen carefully, smartest ones! Check if I’ve really understood life and what’s at its core!

Everywhere I found life, I found a Will to Power; even a servant wants to be the boss.

The strong make the weak serve them — the one who wants to be the boss convinces themselves to accept this because they don’t want to lose their own pleasure.

Just like the weaker gives in to the stronger to get some pleasure and power over others weaker than themselves, even the strongest takes risks and gives up things for power.

The strongest risk their life, danger, and everything to play this risky game.

Where there is sacrifice, service, and love, there is also the desire to be the boss. The weaker sneak in by secret ways into the stronger’s fortress and steal power.

Life told me this secret herself. She said, “Look, I am the one who must always go beyond myself.

You might call this the will to make more life, or the push toward a goal, or something better and bigger — but it’s really all the same secret.”
