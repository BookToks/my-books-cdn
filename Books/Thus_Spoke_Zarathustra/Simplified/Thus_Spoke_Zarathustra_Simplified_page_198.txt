All my hot tears flow down like little streams, heading straight to you!

And all my last strong feelings shine up to you!

Oh, please come back, my strange God! my pain!

My last happiness!

But here, Zarathustra couldn’t hold back anymore. He grabbed his staff and hit the wailer hard. "Stop this," he shouted with angry laughter, "stop acting, you fake! You liar right from the heart! I know you well!

I’ll soon make things tough for you, you evil magician: I know exactly how to do it!" "Stop," said the old man, jumping up, "don’t hit me anymore, Zarathustra! I only did this for fun!

That’s part of my act. I wanted to test you with this show. And you really saw through me!

But you’ve shown a lot about yourself too: you are tough, wise Zarathustra! Your hard 'truths' hit me like a club—that’s the truth!" "Don’t flatter yourself," Zarathustra said, still angry and frowning, "you actor at heart! You’re fake: why talk about truth!

You proud show-off, full of vanity; what were you pretending to be before me, you evil magician? Who was I supposed to believe when you cried like that?" "The one sorry for himself," said the old man, "that’s who I was acting; you came up with that idea yourself—

The poet and magician who finally turns against himself, the changed one who freezes to death because of bad knowledge and guilt.

And admit it: for a long time, Zarathustra, you didn’t see my trick or my lie! You believed I was really in pain when you held my head with both hands—I heard you say, ‘We loved him too little, loved him too little!’ Because I fooled you so well, my wickedness was happy." "Maybe you fooled people smarter than me," Zarathustra said seriously.

"I'm not on guard against liars; I have to be open—that’s my fate.

But you—you have to lie: I know that well enough!"
