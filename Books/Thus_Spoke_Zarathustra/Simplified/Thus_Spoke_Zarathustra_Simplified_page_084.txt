You have always been stubborn and clever, like a donkey, just like the people’s leaders.  

Many powerful people who wanted to do well with the people have put a donkey, a well-known wise person, in front of their horses.  

Now, you famous wise people, I want you to finally take off the lion’s skin completely!  

The skin of a wild animal, the spotted skin, and the messy hair of someone who investigates, searches, and conquers!  

Ah! If I am to believe in your "conscience," you first have to break your respectful will.  

Conscientious, I call someone who goes into lonely, forgotten places and has broken their respectful heart.  

In the dry sands and under the hot sun, they look longingly at the islands full of fountains, where life rests under shady trees.  

But their thirst doesn’t make them want to be like those who are comfortable: because where there are oases, there are also idols.  

Hungry, fierce, lonely, and forgotten by God: that’s how the lion’s will wants to be.  

Free from the happiness of slaves, freed from gods and worship, fearless and scary, great and alone: that’s the will of the conscientious.  

The free spirits have always lived in the wilderness as its rulers, but in the cities live the well-fed, famous wise people — the draft animals.  

Because they always pull, like donkeys, the people’s carts!  

I don’t blame them for this; they are still servants, even if they shine in golden harness.  

And often they have been good servants and earned their pay. Because virtue says: “If you must be a servant, serve the one who most needs you!  

Your master’s spirit and virtue will grow because of your service, and you will grow too with their spirit and virtue!”  

And truly, you famous wise people, servants of the people, you have grown with the people’s spirit and virtue — and the people have grown because of you! I say this to honor you!  

But to me, you are still the people, even with your virtues — the people who are blind and don’t know what spirit is!  

Spirit is life that cuts into life itself: it grows stronger by its own pain — did you know that before?
