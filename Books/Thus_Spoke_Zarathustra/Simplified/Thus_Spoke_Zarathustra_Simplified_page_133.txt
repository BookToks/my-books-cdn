The world is really deep, even deeper than the day can show. Not everything can be said during the day. But the day comes, so let’s say goodbye!

Oh, sky above me, you quiet one! You shining one! You are my happiness before the sun rises! The day comes, so let’s say goodbye! These were Zarathustra’s words.

When Zarathustra was back on the land, he didn’t go straight to his mountains and cave. Instead, he wandered around and asked many questions to learn what had happened to people while he was away. He joked about himself, saying, "Look, I’m like a river that twists and turns back to its start!"

He wanted to see if people had grown better or worse. Once, when he saw a row of new houses, he was surprised and said, "What do these houses mean? Surely, no great person built them as an example!"

Maybe a silly child took them from their toy box? He wished another child would put them back in the box!

And these rooms—can people really live in them? They look like they were made for dolls or fancy eaters who might let others eat with them." Zarathustra stopped and thought deeply. Finally, he said sadly, "Everything has gotten smaller!"

Everywhere he saw lower doorways. People like him could still fit through, but they had to bend down!

Oh, when will I get back to my home where I won’t have to bend down anymore—won’t have to bow to the small-minded!" Zarathustra sighed and looked far away. That same day, he gave a talk about the kind of goodness that makes people smaller.

I walk among these people and watch carefully: they don’t forgive me for not admiring their small virtues.

They get angry at me because I say small people need small virtues—and because I find it hard to accept that small people are needed!
