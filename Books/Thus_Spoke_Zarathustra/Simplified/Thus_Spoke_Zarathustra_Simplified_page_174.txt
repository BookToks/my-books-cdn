And if you would now die, O Zarathustra, behold, we know also how you would then speak to yourself: - but your animals beseech you not to die yet!
 
 You would speak, and without trembling, buoyant rather with bliss, for a great weight and worry would be taken from you, you most patient one!'Now do I die and disappear,' would you say, 'and in a moment I am nothing. Souls are as mortal as bodies.
 
 But the plexus of causes returns in which I am intertwined, - it will again create me! I myself pertain to the causes of the eternal return.
 
 I come again with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this serpent - not to a new life, or a better life, or a similar life: -I come again eternally to this identical and selfsame life, in its greatest and its smallest, to teach again the eternal return of all things,-To speak again the word of the great noontide of earth and man, to announce again to man the overman.
 
 I have spoken my word. I break down by my word: so wills my eternal fate - as announcer do I succumb!
 
 The hour has now come for the down-goer to bless himself. Thus - ends Zarathustra's down-going.'" - When the animals had spoken these words they were silent and waited, so that Zarathustra might say something to them; but Zarathustra did not hear that they were silent. On the contrary, he lay quietly with closed eyes like a person sleeping, although he did not sleep; for he communed just then with his soul. The serpent, however, and the eagle, when they found him silent in such wise, respected the great stillness around him, and prudently retired.
 
 Part 3, (14) THE GREAT LONGING O MY soul, I have taught you to say "today" as "once on a time" and "formerly," and to dance your measure over every Here and There and Yonder.
 
 O my soul, I delivered you from all by-places, I brushed down from 174 you dust and spiders and twilight.
