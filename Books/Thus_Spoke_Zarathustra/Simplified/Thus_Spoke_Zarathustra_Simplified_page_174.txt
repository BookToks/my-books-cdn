And if you were about to die now, Zarathustra, imagine how you would talk to yourself—but your animals beg you not to die yet!

You would speak without fear, feeling happy because a big burden would be lifted from you, you patient one! You might say, "Now I die and disappear. In a moment, I am nothing. Souls die just like bodies do.

But the mix of causes that makes me who I am will come back—it will create me again! I am part of the endless cycle of things coming back.

I will come back with this sun, this earth, this eagle, and this serpent—not to a new life, or a better life, or a similar life—but to this exact same life forever, in its biggest and smallest parts. I will teach again about the eternal return of everything, tell again the story of the great midday of earth and man, and announce the overman to people.

I have said my word. My word breaks me down: this is my eternal fate—as the messenger, I must fall!

Now it’s time for the one who goes down to bless himself. This is how Zarathustra’s journey down ends." 

After the animals said these words, they were quiet and waited for Zarathustra to say something—but he didn’t hear their silence. Instead, he lay still with his eyes closed, like someone sleeping, though he wasn’t asleep; he was talking with his soul. The serpent and the eagle noticed his quiet and wisely left him alone.

Part 3, (14) THE GREAT LONGING

Oh my soul, I have taught you to say "today" like "once upon a time" and "a long time ago," and to dance your own dance everywhere you go.

Oh my soul, I freed you from all the places you shouldn’t be, and I cleaned off your dust, spiders, and gloom.
