I especially noticed that people who call themselves "the good" can be the worst. They hurt others without meaning to, and they lie without meaning to. How could they ever be fair to me?

Living around these good people made me feel sorry for them, and that made me want to lie too. Feeling sorry for others can stop free people from being themselves. The foolishness of the good people is hard to understand.

I learned to hide myself and my true feelings because I saw that everyone seemed poor in spirit. My pity for them was like a lie I believed about everyone.

I could tell in each person what they had enough spirit for and what was too much for them.

Their so-called wise men, who are really just stiff and boring, taught me to speak less clearly sometimes.

Those who dig graves only bring sickness to themselves. Old trash hides bad smells. It’s better not to stir up dirty places. It’s better to live on mountains.

Now I breathe fresh mountain air again with happy nostrils. Finally, my nose is free from the bad smell of all human noise and fuss!

With sharp winds tickling me like sparkling wine, my soul sneezes and cheers, “Good health to you!” That’s what Zarathustra said.

In my last morning dream, I stood on a cliff above the world holding scales to weigh it.

But the pink dawn came too soon and woke me up—she’s always jealous of my morning dreams.

My dream saw the world as something you can measure if you have time, weigh if you’re strong, or guess if you’re wise. My dream was like a brave sailor, part ship and part storm, quiet like a butterfly and quick like a falcon. How did it have the time to weigh the world 148 times today?
