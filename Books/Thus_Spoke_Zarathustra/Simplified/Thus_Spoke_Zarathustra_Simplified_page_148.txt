" Especially did I find those who call themselves "the good," the most poisonous flies; they sting in all innocence, they lie in all innocence; how could they - be just towards me!
 
 He who lives among the good - pity teaches him to lie. Pity makes stifling air for all free souls. For the stupidity of the good is unfathomable.
 
 To conceal myself and my riches - that did I learn down there: for everyone did I still find poor in spirit. It was the lie of my pity, that I knew in every one.
 
 -That I saw and scented in every one, what was enough of spirit for him, and what was too much!
 
 Their stiff wise men: I call them wise, not stiff - thus did I learn to slur over words.
 
 The grave-diggers dig for themselves diseases. Under old rubbish rest bad vapours. One should not stir up the marsh. One should live on mountains.
 
 With blessed nostrils do I again breathe mountain-freedom. Freed at last is my nose from the smell of all human hubbub!
 
 With sharp breezes tickled, as with sparkling wine, sneezes my soul sneezes, and shouts self-congratulatingly: "Health to you!" Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 3, (10) THE THREE EVIL THINGS 1.
 
 IN MY dream, in my last morning-dream, I stood today on a promontory - beyond the world; I held a pair of scales, and weighed the world.
 
 Alas, that the rosy dawn came too early to me: she glowed me awake, the jealous one! Jealous is she always of the glows of my morning-dream.
 
 Measurable by him who has time, weighable by a good weigher, attainable by strong pinions, divinable by divine nutcrackers: thus did my dream find the world:My dream, a bold sailor, half-ship, half-hurricane, silent as the butterfly, impatient as the falcon: how had it the patience and leisure to-day for 148 world-weighing!
