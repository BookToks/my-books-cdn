Oh no, was that the amazing person I just heard shouting?

I really like people who don't care what others think. People are meant to grow and become better.

After Zarathustra left the ugliest man, he felt cold and lonely. His whole body felt colder because his spirit was so sad. But as he kept walking up and down hills, sometimes through green fields and sometimes over rough rocky places where a stream used to flow, he suddenly felt warmer and happier again.

He asked himself, "What’s happening to me? Something warm and alive is making me feel better; it must be nearby."

He felt less alone now because invisible friends were around him, and their warm breath touched his soul. When he looked around to find who was comforting him, he saw cows standing together on a hill, and their closeness and smell made him feel warm inside. The cows seemed to be listening carefully to someone talking and didn’t notice Zarathustra coming closer. When Zarathustra got near, he heard a human voice speaking among the cows, and all the cows were looking at the speaker.

Zarathustra quickly ran over and pushed the cows aside because he was worried someone might be hurt, and cows wouldn’t be able to help much. But he was wrong. There sat a man on the ground, trying to calm the cows and make them not afraid. He was a peaceful man, like a preacher on a mountain, and kindness shone from his eyes. "What are you doing here?" Zarathustra asked him, surprised.

The man answered, "What am I doing here? The same thing you want, troublemaker—looking for happiness on Earth. But I want to learn from these cows first. I’ve already been talking to them for half a morning, and just now they were about to answer me."
