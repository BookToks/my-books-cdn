The person who built this strong, stone structure really understood life, just like the smartest people do!

He knew that even things that look beautiful have struggles and unfairness, and that there is always a fight for power. He shows us this in a very clear way.

Look at how the vault and arch fight each other with light and shadow, like they are battling beautifully. My friends, let’s also be like this—strong, beautiful, and fighting against each other in a good way!

Oh no, the tarantula bit me, my old enemy! It bit my finger, and it’s very painful.

It thinks, “There must be punishment and justice. I won’t just let him celebrate fighting without paying a price!” It’s getting revenge! Now it wants to make me feel dizzy with anger too!

But to avoid getting dizzy, bind me tight to this pillar, my friends! I’d rather be a strong, steady pillar than spin around in a crazy whirl of revenge!

Zarathustra is not like a wild storm or whirlwind. And if he dances, he’s definitely not dancing like a tarantula! That’s what Zarathustra said.

You famous wise people served the people and their superstitions—not the truth! That’s why people respected you.

They also accepted your disbelief because it was just a joke or a side path for the people. Like a master lets his slaves have some freedom, even enjoying their boldness.

But the free spirit—the one who hates being controlled and doesn’t worship anything—is hated by people, like a wolf hated by dogs.

People have always tried to chase him out, calling it “sense of right.” They still send their fiercest dogs after him.

They say, “The truth is with the people! Woe to those who seek it elsewhere!” This has been said forever.

You wanted to make your people proud by being respected. You called this your “Will to Truth,” famous wise ones!

And your heart always told you, “I came from the people, and so the voice of God came to me from them.”
