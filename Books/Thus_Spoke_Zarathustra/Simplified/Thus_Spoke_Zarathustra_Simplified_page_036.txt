I would that they had a madness by which they succumbed, like this pale criminal!
 
 Truly, I would that their madness were called truth, or fidelity, or justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in wretched self-complacency.
 
 I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not. Thus spoke Zarathustra.
 
 Part 1, (7) READING AND WRITING Of all that is written, I love only what a person has written with his blood. Write with blood, and you will find that blood is spirit.
 
 It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.
 
 He who knows the reader, does nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers - and spirit itself will stink.
 
 Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruins in the long run not only writing but also thinking.
 
 Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becomes the rabble.
 
 He that writes in blood and aphorisms does not want to be read, but learnt by heart.
 
 In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route you must have long legs. Aphorisms should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall.
 
 The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.
 
 I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which scares away ghosts, creates for itself goblins - it wants to laugh.
 
 I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I see beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh - that is your thunder-cloud.
 
 You look aloft when you long for exaltation; and I look downward because I am exalted.
 
 Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?
 
 36 He who climbs on the highest mountains, laughs at all tragic plays and tragic realities.
