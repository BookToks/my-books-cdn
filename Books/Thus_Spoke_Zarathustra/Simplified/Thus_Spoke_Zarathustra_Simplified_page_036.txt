I wish they had a kind of madness that made them give in, like this pale criminal!

I wish their madness was called truth, loyalty, or justice. But really, they only have their so-called goodness to live a long time and feel proud of themselves.

I am like a railing next to a fast river; if you can hold onto me, go ahead! But I’m not here to support you like a crutch. That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (7) READING AND WRITING Of everything written, I only love what someone wrote with their own pain and passion. Write with your heart, and you’ll see that heart is like your spirit.

It’s not easy to understand something written by someone very different from you; I don’t like people who just read for fun without thinking.

If someone really knows the reader, they don’t need to do more for them. If everyone just reads without thinking, even spirit will lose its meaning.

If everyone learns to read, it will ruin not just writing but also the way people think over time.

Spirit used to be God, then it became humans, and now it’s becoming just the crowd.

Someone who writes with passion and short, powerful ideas doesn’t want people to just read it, but to remember it deeply.

In the mountains, the shortest path is from one peak to another, but you need strong legs for that. Powerful ideas should be like peaks, and the people who get them should be strong and tall.

The air is fresh and clear, danger is close, and the spirit is full of wild joy: that’s when things fit together well.

I want to have little troublemakers around me because I’m brave. The kind of bravery that scares away ghosts also creates little goblins—it wants to have fun.

I don’t feel connected with you anymore; the cloud I see below me, the dark heavy one I laugh at—that’s your storm cloud.

You look up when you want to feel important; I look down because I already feel important.

Who among you can laugh and feel important at the same time?
