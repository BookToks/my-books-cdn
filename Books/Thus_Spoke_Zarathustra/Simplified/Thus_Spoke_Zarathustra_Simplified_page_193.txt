"But what are you doing?" Zarathustra shouted, worried, because he saw a lot of blood running down the naked arm. "Did some nasty animal bite you, poor guy?"

The bleeding man laughed but was still angry. "Why does it matter to you?" he said and tried to keep walking. "This is my home and my place. Let anyone ask me questions if they want, but I won't answer a fool."

"You’re wrong," Zarathustra said kindly and grabbed him. "You’re wrong. This isn’t your home, it’s my place, and no one gets hurt here.

Call me whatever you want—I am who I am. My name is Zarathustra.

Look! Up there is the path to my cave. It’s not far—won’t you let me help your wounds at my place?

You’ve had a rough time, poor guy: first an animal bit you, and then a man stepped on you!" When the hurt man heard Zarathustra’s name, he changed. "What’s happening to me?" he said. "No one in this life worries me as much as this one man, Zarathustra, and that bloodsucking creature, the leech.

Because of the leech, I lay here by this swamp like a fisherman. My arm was already bitten ten times, when a better leech came for my blood—Zarathustra himself!

Oh happiness! Oh miracle! Praise this day that brought me to this swamp! Praise the best, the liveliest cupping tool alive now; praise the great conscience leech, Zarathustra!" 

The hurt man spoke like this, and Zarathustra was happy about his respectful way of talking. "Who are you?" he asked and gave him his hand. "We have a lot to clear up between us, but I already feel like a bright day is coming."

"I’m the really serious one when it comes to spirit," the man said. "It’s hard for anyone to be stricter, more careful, or tougher about spiritual things than me—except the one I learned from, Zarathustra himself.

It’s better to know nothing than to only kind of know a lot! Better to be your own fool than a “wise” person just because others say so! I go straight to the point: what does it matter if it’s big or small? If it’s called swamp or sky? Just a little solid ground is enough for me if it’s real ground!"
