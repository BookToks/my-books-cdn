He calls a truth that only some people want to hear a lie and nothing more.

He really only believes in gods who make a lot of noise and get attention!

The marketplace is full of show-offs, and people love to brag about their heroes. These heroes seem to control the moment.

But time is running out for them, so they pressure you too. And they want a clear Yes or No from you. Too bad you want to stay in the middle, neither For nor Against.

Don’t get jealous because of those pushy people who want everything to be certain, truth-lover! Truth has never stuck with someone who thinks everything is absolute.

When people are so quick to judge, go back to your safe place: only in the marketplace do people demand a Yes or No.

True understanding takes time, like deep wells that need a long wait to know what’s inside.

Everything great happens away from the marketplace and away from fame. The people who create new ideas have always lived far from the crowd.

Run away, my friend, to your alone time: I see you being attacked by annoying flies. Go where a strong, fresh wind blows!

Escape to your solitude! You’ve been too close to the small and weak people. They secretly want to hurt you!

Don’t fight them anymore! There are too many, and it’s not your job to chase away flies.

There are too many small and weak people; even strong buildings have been destroyed by tiny things like raindrops and weeds.

You’re not made of stone; many small drops have already hollowed you out. Soon, you might break because of all these tiny hits.

I see you tired, bitten by poisonous flies; I see you bleeding and hurt in many places, and your pride doesn’t even complain.

They want your blood without guilt; their empty souls crave it, so they sting you without meaning to be cruel.

But you, deep thinker, you feel these small wounds too much; before you heal, another poison bug crawls over your hand.

You’re too proud to kill these pests. But be careful not to suffer all their painful unfairness!

They also buzz around you with their praise: their praise is annoying. They want to get close to your skin and blood.

They flatter you like you’re a god or a devil; they whine before you like that too. What does it all mean!
