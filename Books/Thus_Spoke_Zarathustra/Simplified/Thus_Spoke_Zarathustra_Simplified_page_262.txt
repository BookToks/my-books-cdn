In November, Nietzsche sends a copy of his book *Genealogy of Morals* to Georg Brandes, a famous Danish literary critic. Brandes replies, saying, "You are definitely the most exciting German writer."

They start writing letters to each other.

In early April, Nietzsche visits Turin and loves the dry weather, the people, the food, and the calm, fancy feeling of the city.

In April, Brandes says he got really angry that no one in Scandinavia knew about Nietzsche. So, he decides to make Nietzsche famous fast. He gives five open lectures about Nietzsche’s ideas at the University of Copenhagen. The talks are a big hit, and Brandes gets a big round of applause. In May, he tells Nietzsche, "Your name is now very popular among smart people in Copenhagen and all of Scandinavia." Later that year, Brandes convinces the famous Swedish writer August Strindberg, who tells Nietzsche, "I’m ending all my letters with ‘Read Nietzsche.’" Nietzsche is very happy about this. The rest of the year is one of his best, with good health and energy. He feels like he is becoming famous. He writes five books, even though he usually writes only one per year. Turin keeps impressing him, especially after September.

In May, he starts working on *The Wagner Case*.

In June, Nietzsche goes to Sils Maria and works on *Twilight of the Idols*.

In September, he finishes *The Wagner Case* and *Twilight of the Idols* and begins *The Antichrist*.

In October, on his 44th birthday, he starts writing his autobiography and a review of his work called *Ecce Homo*.

By the end of November, *The Antichrist* is almost done.

From December 12 to 15, Nietzsche quickly puts together a short book called *Nietzsche Contra Wagner* using parts of his earlier writings.

By the end of December, *Ecce Homo* is almost finished.

On January 3, in Turin, Nietzsche suddenly collapses on the street after he cries and hugs a horse that was being beaten by its owner. When he wakes up in his room, he writes and sends some strange, silly letters. He is taken to a clinic in Basel. At first, his 262 friends believe he will get better.
