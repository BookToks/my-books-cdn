And look, he suddenly came to the gate of the big city.

But right there, a crazy fool with outstretched hands jumped in front of him and blocked his way. This was the same fool people called "the ape of Zarathustra" because he copied some of Zarathustra’s way of talking and maybe wanted to steal some of his wisdom. The fool said to Zarathustra: “Hey Zarathustra, this is the big city. You won’t find anything here, but you can lose a lot.

Why would you want to go through this mess? Think about your feet!

Better spit on the city gate and turn around!

This is a terrible place for deep thoughts: big ideas get ruined here.

Here, important feelings die, and only shallow noises remain.

Don’t you smell the bad stuff from all the dirty places?

Doesn’t this city feel like it’s filled with the smell of destroyed spirits?

Can’t you see souls hanging like dirty rags? And they even make newspapers out of these rags!

Can’t you hear how talking here is just a silly game? It spits out nasty, meaningless words! And they make newspapers from this nonsense too.

People attack each other without knowing why! They get angry without a reason! They fake it with fake money and shiny stuff.

They feel cold but try to find warmth in fake drinks; they feel hot but try to cool down with icy spirits. Everyone is sick because of what people think.

All bad things live here, but so do the “good” people; there’s a lot of fake goodness: fake goodness with busy hands, people who sit around waiting, blessed with tiny awards and weak daughters.

There’s also a lot of fake religion, with people licking and backing up others to please God.

“From above,” a star shines and gentle spit falls; because every lonely heart wants something from the sky.
