Sure, you can find pearls in them, which makes them a bit like hard sea creatures. But instead of having a soul, I often found they were full of salty slime.

They have also learned from the sea how to be vain: isn’t the sea like the most showy peacock?

Even before the ugliest buffalo spreads its tail, the sea shows off its shiny, silver, and silky fan without ever getting tired.

The buffalo looks at this with disgust, standing close to the sand, even closer to the bushes, and closest of all to the swamp.

What does beauty, the sea, or the peacock’s splendor mean to it? I tell this story to the poets.

The spirit of poets is truly like the most vain peacock, full of pride!

People want to see the poet’s spirit – even if they are like buffaloes! But I got tired of this spirit, and I see a time coming when it will be tired of itself.

Yes, I have seen poets change, and now they look at themselves.

I have seen poets become sorry for their own spirit; they grew out of the poets. So said Zarathustra.

There is an island in the sea – not far from the Happy Isles where Zarathustra stayed – with a volcano that always smokes. The people there, especially the old women, say it stands like a rock in front of the gate to the underworld. They believe the narrow path to this gate goes through the volcano.

Around the time Zarathustra was on the Happy Isles, a ship stopped at the island with the smoking mountain. The crew went ashore to hunt rabbits. Near noon, when the captain and his men were together again, they suddenly saw a man flying toward them through the air. A voice clearly said, "It’s time! It’s the highest time!"

When the figure got close (but flew past quickly like a shadow toward the volcano), they were very surprised to recognize Zarathustra. They had all seen him before except the captain, and they loved him like people love someone they both admire and respect.
