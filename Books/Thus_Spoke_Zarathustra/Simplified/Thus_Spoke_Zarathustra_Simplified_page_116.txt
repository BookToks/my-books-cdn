Isn’t hurt pride the cause of most tragedies? But when pride gets hurt, something better than pride can grow.

Life looks good only if it’s played well, and to do that, you need good actors.

I’ve noticed that all the vain people make good actors: they act and want others to enjoy watching them – that’s their whole goal.

They show off who they are or make up who they want to be; I like watching life around them – it feels less sad.

That’s why I don’t mind the vain people, because they help cure my sadness and keep me interested in people like watching a play.

Also, no one really understands how shy or modest a vain person can be! I like them because of this modesty.

They learn to believe in themselves from you; they live off your attention and praise.

They even believe your nice lies about them, because deep inside they’re asking, “Who am I?” If being truly good means not knowing how good you are, then vain people don’t know how modest they really are!

This is my third smart idea: I don’t lose respect for bad people just because you’re scared of them.

I’m happy to see the amazing things the warm sun creates: tigers, palm trees, and rattlesnakes.

There are also amazing and beautiful people, even among the bad ones.

Honestly, the smartest people didn’t seem that smart to me, and wickedness isn’t as great as its reputation.

I often wondered, shaking my head: Why do you keep making noise, rattlesnakes?

Really, even evil has a future! And there are still warm, unexplored places on Earth.

Many things now called the worst evil are actually small and short-lived. But someday, bigger dangers will come.

For the “overman” (a super strong person) to have a worthy challenge, the world still needs a lot of warmth and wild places!

Just like wild cats turned into tigers, and poisonous frogs turned into crocodiles, the good hunter needs a good hunt!

And truly, you good and fair people!
