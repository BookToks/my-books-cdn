Their knees always bow down, and their hands seem like they do good things, but their hearts don’t really understand what’s right.

Some people say, “Being good is important,” but deep down, they only think that having police around is important.

Many people who can’t see the good in others say it’s good to only notice people’s bad sides. They call this way of seeing things a kind of “virtue.”

Some want to feel inspired and call that being good. Others want to feel bad and also call that being good.

Almost everyone thinks they are good in some way; almost everyone says they know what’s right and wrong. But Zarathustra didn’t come to tell these liars and fools what virtue is.

He came so that you, my friends, would get tired of old ideas you learned from fools and liars: words like “reward,” “punishment,” and “justice.”

He wants you to stop saying, “An action is good because it’s unselfish.” Instead, my friends, let your true self be part of your actions, like a mother is part of her child—that should be your idea of being good!

Really, I have taken away many of your old ideas and favorite ways of thinking about being good, and now you’re upset, like children.

They were playing by the sea, then a wave came and took their toys away, and now they cry.

But that same wave will bring new toys and pretty shells to play with!

That will make them feel better; and just like them, my friends, you will find new comfort and new beautiful things! This is what Zarathustra said.

Life with the crowd can be fun, but where the crowd drinks, all the water gets dirty.

I like everything clean and pure, but I hate to see fake smiles and the hunger of the dirty.
