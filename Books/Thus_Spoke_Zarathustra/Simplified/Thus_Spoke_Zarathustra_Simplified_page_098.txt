Everything that feels strange or scary about the future is actually more familiar than what you call "reality." You say, "We are real and don't believe in myths or superstitions," and you brag about that—too bad, because you’re not as confident as you think!

How could you believe anything, you who are made up of all kinds of beliefs from the past?

You are like walking arguments against belief itself, confusing and messing up all thinking. I call you unbelievable, even though you think you’re real!

Different times argue inside your minds, and the dreams and stories from the past were even more real than what you think is waking life!

You don’t create anything new, so you don’t have belief. But anyone who creates always had dreams and visions before, and they believed in believing!

You are like half-open doors where grave-diggers wait. This is your reality: “Everything must die.” Oh, how thin and empty you look! Many of you probably know this feeling.

Many have said, “Did God secretly take something from me while I slept? Maybe enough to make a girl for Himself!”

“My ribs are so weak and poor!” many people today have said.

Yes, you people today are funny to me! Especially when you admire yourselves.

And I would be sad if I couldn’t laugh at how amazed you are and had to accept all the ugly things you offer.

But instead, I’ll make fun of you because I have heavy things to carry; and it doesn’t matter if bugs land on my load!

That won’t make my burden heavier! And it’s not because of you, people today, that I feel so tired.

Oh, where can I go with my longing? I look from all mountains for homes.

But I haven’t found a home anywhere: I don’t feel settled in any city and I leave through every gate.

People today feel strange and like a joke to me, even though recently my heart wanted to connect with them; but I feel like an outsider from all homes.

So I only love my children’s land, the unknown faraway place across the sea: that’s where I send my sails to keep searching.
