I say this clearly, even if it sounds harsh: the world is like a person—it has a dark side, and that’s true!

There is a lot of bad stuff in the world, that’s true too! But that doesn’t mean the world itself is some terrible monster.

There’s a reason why some things in the world stink: feeling disgust helps us grow and find new ways to live!

Even the best things have flaws, and even the best can be improved. My friends, there is wisdom in knowing the world isn’t perfect!

I’ve heard religious people say these things to calm themselves, and they mean well, but honestly, their ideas can be tricky and unfair.

“Let the world stay as it is! Don’t fight it!” “Let those who hurt others do it; don’t stop them! They’ll learn to give up on the world.” “Don’t even trust your own thinking—it’s part of this world! That way, you’ll learn to give up too.” 

Break those old ideas, my friends! Tear apart the beliefs of those who hate the world!

People now quietly say, “The more you learn, the less you want.” 

“Wisdom makes you tired; nothing matters; don’t want anything!” I even saw this written in public places.

Break apart this new idea too, my friends! It was made by people tired of life, by those who talk about death and control others. It’s a message that leads to slavery.

They learned the wrong way, too fast, and took in bad things. Because of that, their spirit is sick—like a weak stomach that makes them feel bad inside.

Life can be full of joy, but if your spirit is sick, everything feels poisoned.

Understanding things is a joy for strong people! But those who are tired just get pushed around by life.

This is how weak people are: they lose their way.
