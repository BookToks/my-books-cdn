He doesn’t really fit in anywhere. His ideas influenced people outside of college life – like artists, dancers, poets, writers, psychologists, and playwrights. Some famous people who said Nietzsche influenced them a lot were Picasso, Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, William Butler Yeats, Rainer Rilke, Allen Ginsberg, Khalil Gibran, Martin Buber, H.L. Mencken, Emma Goldman, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Jack London, Franz Kafka, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Karl Jaspers, Alfred Adler, Fritz Perls, Eugene O’Neill, and George Bernard Shaw.

There are lots of books and articles trying to explain and organize Nietzsche’s ideas. Professors study his normal life to find reasons or patterns behind his radical thoughts. Many try to fit him into the usual ideas of western philosophy. But I think Nietzsche started something totally new, different from the western philosophy he was defending. He wanted to be a new kind of philosopher who looked beyond regular “systems of thought.”

“I don’t trust people who try to make everything fit into a system, and I avoid them. Wanting a system shows a lack of honesty.” – Twilight of the Idols (part 2, sec 26). Try reading Nietzsche yourself. He mostly wrote in a clear and direct way, without complicated language. See if he brings out the artist, psychologist, or dancer inside you.

Summary of Nietzsche’s Life: Other than dealing with a painful illness all his life and a short friendship with the famous composer Richard Wagner, Nietzsche had a pretty normal life. His family wasn’t rich, so he had to work as a professor of philology to make a living.
