Have you now learned my song? Have you divined what it would say?
 
 Well! Cheer up! you higher men, sing now my roundelay!
 
 Sing now yourselves the song, the name of which is "Once more," the signification of which is "Unto all eternity!" - sing, you higher men, Zarathustra's roundelay!
 
 O man! Take heed!
 
 What says deep midnight's voice indeed?
 
 "I slept my sleep-, "From deepest dream I've woke, and plead:"The world is deep, "And deeper than the day could read.
 
 "Deep is its woe-, "Joy - deeper still than grief can be: "Woe says: Hence! Go!
 
 "But joys all want eternity-, "-Want deep, profound eternity!" Part 4, (20) THE SIGN IN THE morning, however, after this night, Zarathustra jumped up from his couch, and, having girded his loins, he came out of his cave glowing and strong, like a morning sun coming out of gloomy mountains.
 
 "you great star," spoke he, as he had spoken once before, "you deep eye of happiness, what would be all your happiness if you had not those for whom you shine!
 
 And if they remained in their chambers whilst you are already awake, and come and bestow and distribute, how would your proud modesty upbraid for it!
 
 Well! they still sleep, these higher men, whilst I am awake: they are not my proper companions! Not for them do I wait here in my mountains.
 
 At my work I want to be, at my day: but they understand not what are the signs of my morning, my step - is not for them the awakening-call.
 
 They still sleep in my cave; their dream still drinks at my drunken songs. The audient ear for me - the obedient ear, is yet lacking in their limbs." 252 -This had Zarathustra spoken to his heart when the sun arose: then looked he inquiringly aloft, for he heard above him the sharp call of his eagle.
