Have you learned my song now? Do you understand what it means?

Well! Cheer up! You important people, sing my song now!

Sing the song called "Once more," which means "Forever!" Sing, you important people, Zarathustra’s song!

Hey, listen up, people!

What does the deep voice of midnight say?

“I slept deeply, “I woke up from a deep dream and say: “The world is deep, “Deeper than daylight can understand.

“It has deep pain, “But joy is even deeper than pain: “Pain says: Go away!

“But joys want to last forever, “They want deep, endless happiness!”

In the morning, after this long night, Zarathustra jumped up from his bed. He got ready and came out of his cave shining and strong, like the sun rising over dark mountains.

“You big star,” he said like before, “you happy shining eye, what would your happiness be if you didn’t have people to shine for?

And if they stayed in bed while you were already awake, giving light and gifts, how would you feel about that?

Well! These important people still sleep while I’m awake: they aren’t the right friends for me! I’m not waiting for them here in the mountains.

I want to work and live in the day, but they don’t understand my morning signs, my call to wake up isn’t for them.

They still sleep in my cave, dreaming to my wild songs. They don’t yet listen carefully or follow me with their bodies.”

Zarathustra said this to himself when the sun came up. Then he looked up because he heard his eagle’s sharp call above him.
