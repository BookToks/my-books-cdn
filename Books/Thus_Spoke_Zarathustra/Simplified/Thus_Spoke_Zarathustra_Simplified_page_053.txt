The ghost that runs ahead of you, my brother, is more beautiful than you; why don’t you give it your body and soul? But you’re scared and run to your neighbor instead.

You can’t stand being alone with yourself, and you don’t love yourself enough. So, you try to trick your neighbor into loving you, and you’d rather shine with their mistake than be real.

I wish you couldn’t stand being with anyone close to you or their neighbor. Then you’d have to make your own friend and their big, loving heart from inside yourself.

You ask someone to say good things about you; and when they believe those things, you start to believe them too.

It’s not just a lie when someone says things they know aren’t true, but it’s even worse when they say things they don’t even understand. That’s how you talk about yourself and fool your neighbor.

The fool says, "Being with people ruins your character, especially if you don’t have one." One person goes to their neighbor to find themselves, and another goes to lose themselves. Your bad love for yourself makes being alone feel like a prison.

The ones farthest from you pay the price for your love to those close to you; and when there are five of you together, a sixth one always has to die.

I don’t like your parties either: there are too many fake people there, and even the watchers act like actors.

I’m not teaching you to love your neighbor, but to love your friend. Let your friend be the best thing on earth, and a glimpse of something greater.

I teach you about the friend with a big heart that overflows. But you have to know how to be like a sponge if you want to be loved by someone with so much love.

I teach you about the friend who has a full world inside them, a creator friend who always has a whole world to give.

As the world grew for them, it folds back up again for them like circles, as good growing from evil, and purpose growing from chance.

Let the future and faraway things be your reason for today; in your friend, you’ll love the greater person as your reason.

My brothers, I tell you not to love your neighbor — I tell you to love the farthest! This is what Zarathustra said.

Would you go live alone, my brother?
