You can only stand firmly on a small, solid ground. When you truly understand something, nothing feels too big or too small.

"Are you an expert on leeches?" asked Zarathustra. "Do you study them deeply and carefully?"  
"Oh, Zarathustra," the tired man replied, "that would be huge! How could I even try?

But I do know the leech’s brain—that’s my world!  
And it really is a whole world! Forgive me if I sound proud, but here, I’m the best. That’s why I said, ‘This is my home.’ I’ve studied the leech’s brain so much that I can’t be fooled by its tricky secrets anymore! This is where I’m the boss.

I gave up everything else for this. Nothing else matters to me now. But right next to what I know is a big black space of things I don’t know.

My conscience tells me to focus on one thing, not everything. I don’t like vague or dreamy ideas.

Where I’m honest, I see clearly. Where I don’t want to know, I choose to be blind.

Where I want to learn, I want to be strict, tough, focused, and even cruel if I have to.

Because you once said, ‘Spirit is life that cuts into life itself.’ That idea pulled me to your teaching. And honestly, I’ve even hurt myself to learn more!"  
“As you can see,” Zarathustra said, pointing to the man’s arm where ten leeches were still biting him.

“You’re a strange guy, and you’ve already taught me a lot—maybe too much for your ears!

Well, let’s part here! But I hope to see you again. My cave is up there; tonight, you’ll be my guest!

I also want to make up for stepping on you earlier. I’m thinking about that. But right now, I hear someone in trouble and have to leave quickly.”  
That’s what Zarathustra said.
