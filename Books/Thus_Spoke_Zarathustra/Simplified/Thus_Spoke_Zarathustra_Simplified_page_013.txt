I praise God by singing, crying, laughing, growling, and humming. But what gift do you bring us?" When Zarathustra heard this, he bowed to the old man and said, "What could I give you? I should hurry away so I don’t take anything from you!" And so, they separated like two boys laughing together.

When Zarathustra was alone, he thought, "Is it possible? This old man in the forest doesn’t even know that God is dead!"

When Zarathustra reached the nearest town near the forest, he saw many people gathered in the market because a tightrope walker was going to perform. Zarathustra spoke to them: "I teach you about the overman. Humans are meant to be surpassed. What have you done to go beyond being human?

All creatures before you have made something better than themselves. But you want to stop growing and even go back to being animals instead of moving beyond humans?

What is an ape to a human? Something to laugh at or feel embarrassed about.

And just like that, humans will be laughed at or embarrassed by the overman.

You have come from being worms to humans, but inside you, there is still some worm. You used to be apes, and humans are still more like apes than actual apes.

Even the smartest people are just a mix of plants and spirits. But I’m not telling you to become spirits or plants.

Look, I teach you about the overman!

The overman is the true meaning of Earth. Let your will say: The overman will be the meaning of the Earth!

I ask you, my brothers, stay connected to Earth and don’t believe anyone who talks about hopes in another world! They are poisoners, even if they don’t realize it.

They hate life and are sick and fading away, and Earth is tired of them: let them disappear!

Once, sinning against God was the worst sin; but God is dead, and with him, those sinners are gone too.
