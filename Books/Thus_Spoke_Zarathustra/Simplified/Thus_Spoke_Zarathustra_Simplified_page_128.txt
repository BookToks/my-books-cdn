When he was still far away from the Happy Isles and his friends, after traveling for four days, he finally got through all his pain. He accepted his fate again, strong and sure. Then Zarathustra spoke to himself with pride: I am alone again, just like before, alone with the clear sky and the open sea; and the afternoon is all around me.

I first met my friends on an afternoon; I met them again on another afternoon—when the light starts to calm down.

Whenever happiness is coming between the sky and the earth, it looks for a bright soul to stay with. With happiness, the light becomes calmer now.

Oh, afternoon of my life! Once my happiness went down to the valley to find a place to stay, and it found those kind, open souls.

Oh, afternoon of my life! I gave up so much just to have one thing: this growing garden of my thoughts and the beginning of my biggest hope!

The one who creates once looked for friends and children of his hope. But he found out he couldn’t find them unless he first made them himself.

So here I am, in the middle of my work, going to my children and coming back from them. Zarathustra must improve himself for the sake of his children.

In your heart, you only love your child and your work. When you love yourself a lot, it means you are ready to create something new—I have found this to be true.

My children are still young and fresh, standing close together like trees in my garden, growing in my best soil and shaking in the wind.

Where trees like these grow side by side, there are Happy Isles!

But one day I will take each of them and put them alone, so they can learn how to be lonely, strong, and wise.

They will stand tough and flexible by the sea, like living lighthouses of unbreakable life.

Where storms rush into the sea and the mountain’s nose drinks the water, each of them will have their own day and night to watch and to learn.
