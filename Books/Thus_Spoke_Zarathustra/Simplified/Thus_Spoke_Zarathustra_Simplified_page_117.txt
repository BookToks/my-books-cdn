There’s a lot about you that’s funny, especially how scared you are of what you call "the devil!" You don’t understand what’s truly great, so someone who is better than everyone else would actually scare you because of how good they are.

And you smart people, you would run away from the bright light of wisdom that the overman happily enjoys without any shame.

To the best and highest people I’ve met, I have my doubts and I secretly laugh: I think you would call my overman a devil!

I got tired of these so-called best people: from their high place, I wanted to be even higher, far away with the overman!

I felt scared when I saw these best people without any pretenses; that’s when I wanted to fly away into a future far beyond what anyone has imagined.

Into far future places, even further south than any artist has dreamed of—places where gods feel ashamed to wear any clothes!

But I want to see you, my neighbors and friends, dressed up and proud as if you are "good and just;" and I will also hide myself among you—so I can confuse you and myself. That is my last bit of careful manliness. This is what Zarathustra said.

What’s wrong with me, my friends? You see I’m upset, pushed away, obeying without wanting to, ready to leave—sadly, to leave you!

Yes, Zarathustra must go back to being alone again, but this time it’s not happy—like a bear going back to its cave.

What happened to me? Who told me to do this? Oh, my angry secret is the reason; she spoke to me. Have I ever told you her name?

Yesterday evening, my quietest moment spoke to me: that is the name of my scary secret.

And this is how it happened—you need to know everything so your heart won’t turn cold when I leave suddenly!

Do you know the fear someone feels when falling asleep? From head to toe, they’re scared because the ground seems to disappear and the dream begins.

I’m telling you this in a story. Yesterday, at my quietest moment, the ground slipped away beneath me: the dream started.
