You say one thing is more important than another, right? Well, right now, one thing is more important to me than anything else.

A word at the right time: didn’t you invite me to eat? Many people have traveled a long way to get here. You don’t mean to feed us just with talks, do you?

Also, all of you have worried too much about freezing, drowning, suffocating, and other physical dangers. But none of you have thought about my danger—dying of hunger. 

(The soothsayer said this. When Zarathustra’s animals heard it, they ran away scared because they saw that what they brought wouldn’t be enough to fill the soothsayer.) 

“Also dying of thirst,” the soothsayer went on. “Even though I hear water splashing here like wise words—lots and lots— I want wine!

Not everyone is born to drink water like Zarathustra. Water doesn’t help tired and worn-out people. We deserve wine—it’s the only thing that gives quick energy and health!”

When the soothsayer said he wanted wine, the quiet king on the left spoke up for once. “We took care of the wine,” he said, “me and my brother, the king on the right. We have plenty of wine—a whole donkey-load of it.

So the only thing missing is bread.” 

“Bread,” laughed Zarathustra. “Hermits don’t have bread. But people don’t live by bread alone; they need good lamb meat too. I have two lambs—we’ll kill them and cook them with spicy sage—that’s how I like it. There are also plenty of roots and fruits, good enough for picky eaters, plus nuts and other things to crack open.

We’ll have a great meal soon. But anyone who wants to eat with us must help with the cooking, even the kings. Because with Zarathustra, even a king can be a cook.”

Everyone liked this idea, except the voluntary beggar, who didn’t want meat, wine, or spices.

“Listen to this glutton Zarathustra!” he joked. “Do people go into caves and mountains to make fancy meals like this?

Now I finally get what he taught us before: Blessed be moderate poverty!”
