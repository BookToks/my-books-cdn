You have shown us humility; it almost feels like you have hurt our respect for you. But who else could humble themselves like you have, and still be so proud? That pride lifts us up too; it feels good to see and feel.

Just to see this, we would happily climb even higher mountains. We came eager to watch, wanting to see something that brightens tired eyes.

And now, our sad cries are over. Our minds and hearts are open and filled with joy. We almost feel like our spirits want to dance.

There is nothing on earth more beautiful than a strong, high will: it is the best kind of growth. A whole scene feels fresh and alive because of one such strong person.

I compare you, Zarathustra, to a pine tree that grows tall, quiet, tough, alone, with the best, most flexible wood, proud and strong. In the end, it reaches out with strong green branches, asking big questions to the wind and storm, and everything that lives on high places; it answers like a leader and a winner! Oh! Who wouldn’t want to climb high mountains to see trees like that?

At your tree, Zarathustra, even those who feel sad or weak find new strength; your presence makes even unsure people steady and heals their hearts.

Many eyes are turning toward your mountain and your tree today; a strong hope has grown, and many have learned to ask, "Who is Zarathustra?" Those who have heard your words and sweet messages—the lonely ones and the pairs—have all asked their hearts, "Is Zarathustra still alive? Life feels pointless now, or we must live with Zarathustra!" Many ask, "Why doesn’t he come after all this time? Has he been swallowed by loneliness? Or should we go to him?" Now loneliness itself is breaking open, like a grave that can no longer hold its dead. Everywhere, people are waking up.

Now the waves rise higher and higher around your mountain, Zarathustra.
