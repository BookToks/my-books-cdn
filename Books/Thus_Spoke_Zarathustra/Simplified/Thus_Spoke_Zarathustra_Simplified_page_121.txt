The Wanderer

Around midnight, Zarathustra walked over the ridge of the island. He wanted to reach the other side early in the morning because he planned to sail from there. That place had a good spot where ships liked to stop, and many people used those ships to leave the Happy Isles.

As Zarathustra climbed the mountain, he thought about all the times he had wandered alone since he was young. He remembered the many mountains and ridges he had climbed.

He said to himself, “I am a wanderer and mountain climber. I don’t like flat lands, and I can’t stay still for long.”

No matter what happens to me, he thought, it will always be a kind of wandering and climbing. In the end, you only really experience yourself.

The time when bad things could happen to me is over, he believed. Now, nothing can happen to me that isn’t already part of who I am.

Everything comes back to me in the end — my true Self, even the parts that have been lost or scattered for a long time.
