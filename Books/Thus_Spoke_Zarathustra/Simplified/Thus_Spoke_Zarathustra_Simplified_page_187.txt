"Eat and drink with me today, and forgive me for being a cheerful old man sitting here with you!"  
"A cheerful old man?" the soothsayer said, shaking his head. "Whoever you are, Zarathustra, you’ve been up here the longest. Soon, your boat won’t rest on dry land anymore!"  
"Am I resting on dry land?" Zarathustra asked, laughing.  
"The waves around your mountain," the soothsayer said, "are rising higher and higher. These waves of big troubles will soon lift your boat and carry you away."  

Zarathustra was quiet and thought about this.  
"Don’t you hear anything?" the soothsayer asked. "Doesn’t it rush and roar from down below?" Zarathustra stayed silent and listened. Then he heard a long, long cry echoing between the depths, passed around because no one wanted to keep it — it sounded really bad.  

"You bad messenger," Zarathustra finally said, "that’s a cry of pain, a human cry. Maybe it comes from a dark sea. But why should I care about human pain? Do you know what my last sin is called?"  
"Pity!" the soothsayer said, his heart full, raising his hands high. "Zarathustra, I came to tempt you into your last sin!"  

Right after he said that, the cry sounded again, longer and scarier than before — much closer too.  
"Do you hear it? Do you hear, Zarathustra?" the soothsayer shouted. "The cry is for you, calling you: Come, come, come; it’s time, the very best time!"  

Zarathustra was quiet, confused and shaken. Finally, he asked like someone unsure: "And who is calling me?"  
"You know who it is," the soothsayer said warmly. "Why hide from it? It’s the higher man who’s calling you!"  

"The higher man?" Zarathustra cried, scared. "What does he want? The higher man! Why is he here?" He was sweating all over.  

But the soothsayer didn’t pay attention to Zarathustra’s fear. He kept listening down below. When it got quiet for a long time, he looked back and saw Zarathustra trembling.  

"Oh Zarathustra," he said sadly, "you don’t look like someone happy and dizzy with joy. You’ll have to dance carefully, or you might fall!"
