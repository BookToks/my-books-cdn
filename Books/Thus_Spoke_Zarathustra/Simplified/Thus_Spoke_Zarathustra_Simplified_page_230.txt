When Zarathustra said these words, he stood near the entrance of his cave. But after finishing, he quietly left his guests and went outside for a while.

"Oh, clean smells all around me," he shouted. "Oh, peaceful quiet all around me!

But where are my animals? Come here, come here, my eagle and my snake!

Tell me, my animals: these higher men, do they maybe not smell good? Oh, clean smells all around me! Now I really know and feel how much I love you, my animals." And Zarathustra said again, "I love you, my animals!" The eagle and the snake moved close to him when he said this and looked up at him. The three of them stayed quiet together and breathed in the fresh air. The air outside was better than the air with the higher men.

As soon as Zarathustra left the cave, the old magician stood up, looked around sneaky, and said, "He’s gone!

And now, you higher men—I’ll call you that just like he does—my bad spirit of lies and magic starts to bother me, my sad devil. This devil is an enemy of Zarathustra deep down inside. Please forgive it! Now it wants to speak to you because this is its moment. I can’t fight this bad spirit.

To all of you, no matter what fancy names you use for yourselves—whether you call yourselves ‘free spirits,’ ‘the careful ones,’ ‘the sorry ones,’ ‘the unchained,’ or ‘the great dreamers’—to all of you who, like me, feel deep disgust, to whom the old God is dead and no new God has been born yet—my bad spirit and magic devil are on your side.

I know you, you higher men, and I know him too—I know this fiend that I love even though I shouldn’t, this Zarathustra. He often seems to me like a pretty mask of a saint, like a new strange act that my bad spirit, the sad devil, enjoys. I love Zarathustra, but sometimes it feels like it’s just because of my bad spirit."
