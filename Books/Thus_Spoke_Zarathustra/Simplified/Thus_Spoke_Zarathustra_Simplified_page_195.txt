When Zarathustra walked around a rock, he saw a man not far below him on the same path. The man was moving wildly like a crazy person and finally fell down on his stomach. Zarathustra thought to himself, "That must be an important man because I heard a terrible cry from him. I want to see if I can help."

Zarathustra ran to where the man was lying. He found an old man shaking and staring fixedly. Zarathustra tried many times to help him stand up, but it didn’t work. The old man didn’t seem to notice Zarathustra at all. Instead, he kept looking around and moving his hands like he was all alone and forgotten by everyone.

After a long time, the old man started to cry out: Who will keep me warm, who still loves me?

Give me warm hands!

Give me something to warm my heart!

Lying down, stretched out and shaking, like someone half dead and cold, whose feet need warming.

Shaken by strange fevers, trembling from sharp, icy cold pains, chased by you, my own mind!

It’s strange! Deep! Scary!

You hunter hiding behind the clouds!

Now struck by you like lightning, your mocking eyes watching me in the dark.

This is how I lie, bending and twisting, shaking with endless pain, hit by you, cruel hunter, you unknown god.

Hit me harder!

Hit me once more!

Pierce and tear my heart!
