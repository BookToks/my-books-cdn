You, with your snowy beard and quiet winter sky, you with your big, white eyes looking down at me! Oh, you remind me of my soul and its wild desires!

Do I have to hide myself like someone who’s swallowed gold – so my soul doesn’t get torn apart?

Do I have to act taller, so people can’t see my long legs – all those jealous and mean people around me?

Those dull, warm-by-the-fire, tired, jealous, and grumpy people – how could they stand to see me happy?

So, I only show them the cold and winter on my mountain tops – not that my winds carry the warm sunlight all around!

They only hear the howling of my winter storms, and don’t know that I also travel over warm seas, like hot, longing south winds.

They feel sorry for my bad luck and problems – but I say, “Let whatever happens come to me; it’s innocent like a little child!” How could they handle my happiness if I didn’t cover it with bad luck, cold winters, warm bear-skin hats, and swirling snowflakes?

If I didn’t feel sorry for their pity – the pity from those jealous and mean people!

If I didn’t sigh in front of them, shiver with cold, and let them feel sorry for me!

This is the smart and kind part of my soul: it doesn’t hide its winters and cold storms; it doesn’t hide its cold sores either.

For some people, being alone means they’re sick and running away; for others, it means running away from sick people.

Let those poor, squinty people hear me shiver and sigh in the cold! I escape their hot rooms with my sighs and shivers.

Let them feel sorry for me and sigh because of my cold sores: “He’ll freeze to death from knowing too much!” they say sadly.

Meanwhile, I run with warm feet everywhere on my olive-covered mountain; in the sunny spot on my mountain, I sing and laugh at all their pity. That’s what Zarathustra said.

Slowly wandering through many people and cities, Zarathustra finally returned by long, winding roads to his mountains and his cave.
