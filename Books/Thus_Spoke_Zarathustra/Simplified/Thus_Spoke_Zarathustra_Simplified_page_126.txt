"Everything straight is a lie," the dwarf said with a sneer. "All truth is twisted; time itself is a circle."

"You serious guy!" I said angrily, "don’t take this too lightly! Or I’ll leave you right where you are, Haltfoot — and I carried you high!"

"Look," I went on, "This Moment! From this gate, This Moment, there’s a long endless road going backward: behind us is forever.

Doesn’t everything that can happen already happen on that road? Doesn’t everything that can happen already exist, finish, and pass by?

And if everything has already happened, what do you think, dwarf, about This Moment? Didn’t this gate already exist too?

And isn’t everything connected so that This Moment pulls all the things coming after it? So it pulls itself too?

Because everything that can happen on that long road going forward — it must happen again! And this slow spider creeping in the moonlight, and the moonlight itself, and you and me here whispering about forever — haven’t we all already existed?

And don’t we have to come back and run on that other road ahead, that strange long road — don’t we have to come back forever?"

I spoke like that, softer and softer, because I was scared of my own thoughts and the thoughts behind those thoughts. Then suddenly, I heard a dog howl nearby.

Had I ever heard a dog howl like that? My mind went back. Yes! When I was a kid, a long time ago — I heard a dog howl like that. I saw it too, hair standing up, head raised, shaking in the quiet night when even dogs believe in ghosts. It made me feel sorry for it. At that moment, the full moon passed silently over the house; it stood still, glowing, like a ball resting on a roof, like it belonged to someone. That scared the dog because dogs believe in thieves and ghosts. When I heard that howl again, it made me feel sorry again.

Where was the dwarf now? And the gate? And the spider? And all the whispering? Had I dreamed it? Was I awake? Suddenly, I was standing alone among rough rocks, feeling sad in the saddest moonlight.
