You came to me looking beautiful, hidden in your beauty, and you spoke without words, showing your wisdom clearly. How could I not understand all the quietness in your soul? You came to me before the sun rose—I was the loneliest person.

We have been friends from the start: we share sadness, scary things, and the same ground; even the sun belongs to both of us.

We don’t talk much because we know too much about each other—we stay quiet but smile, sharing our understanding without words.

Aren’t you the light that fuels my fire? Don’t you have a soul like mine that understands deeply?

Together we learned everything; together we learned to rise above ourselves and smile without any worries—smile clearly from bright eyes and far away, even when everything below us is full of pressure, rules, and guilt.

I wandered alone, wondering what my soul wanted at night and through confusing paths. I climbed mountains, but who was I really looking for if not you?

All my wandering and climbing were necessary, just a way for my restless soul to fly—to fly straight into you!

What have I hated more than passing clouds and anything that harms you? I even hated my own hate because it hurt you!

I hate the passing clouds—they sneak in like wild cats and take away what we share—the big, endless "Yes" and "Amen."

We hate these in-between things—the passing clouds—that never really learn to truly bless or truly curse.

I’d rather sit in a tub under a closed sky, or sit in a deep dark place without heaven, than see you, my bright heaven, covered by passing clouds!

Often I wished I could catch them with sharp lightning and, like thunder, drum on their bellies—an angry drummer because they steal your "yes" and "Amen" from me! You, my bright sky above, my pure and shining heaven! Because they steal your "yes" and "Amen" from me.

I’d rather have noise, thunder, and storms than quiet, doubting, sneaky clouds. And among people, I hate most the quiet, unsure ones—the passing clouds who can’t decide or commit.
