Knowing this, a long life does not seem so important as it used to be.
 
 Your body naturally strives for a full and fruitful life. However the higher spirit of your body knows that whether you live 40 or 80 or 20 or even 5 years, it is not too important. You can take risks.
 
 Becoming a Spiritual Adventurer Awareness is the world's mystical experience. Give the world a thrill.
 
 Become a spiritual adventurer.
 
 All the wasted energy of trying to make believe you continue after death evaporates. The world appears. Adventures can begin. Of course your world contains numerous people who will not like anyone exposing, mocking or even ignoring their social fantasies. You still play the social games - only they're not important anymore. Those close to you, family and friends, probably won't understand. It doesn't matter. They are more real and more lovely to look at than ever. You respond as you always have, but without the fear, without the edge. Laughter is always very close â€¦ but unseen.
 
 Urges to preach "The New Awareness" to yourself or others give you a hearty laugh. It is as self-contradictory as a Zen koan.
 
 Nietzsche's "love of fate", "that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity" becomes more real to you.
 
 There's no one to save, no one to bring to self-realization, no one even to awaken. Either you're destined to have the thought of eternal recurrence hit you or you're not.
 
 What kind of adventures will you have? No one can tell you. It's in your spirit and only you can ride your spirit.
