Knowing this, living a long life doesn’t seem as important as it once did.

Your body naturally wants you to have a full and meaningful life. But the deeper part of you knows that whether you live 40, 80, 20, or even 5 years, it doesn’t really matter. You can take risks.

Becoming a Spiritual Adventurer means being aware of the world’s mysterious experience. Make life exciting.

Become a spiritual adventurer.

All the wasted energy of pretending you live on after death disappears. The world shows up clearly. Adventures can start. Of course, many people around you won’t like it if you expose, make fun of, or ignore their social ideas. You still play social games — but they don’t matter as much anymore. Your family and friends might not understand. That’s okay. They seem more real and beautiful than ever. You act like you always did, but without fear or stress. Laughter feels close, but hidden.

The urge to preach “The New Awareness” to yourself or others makes you laugh. It’s as confusing as a Zen riddle.

Nietzsche’s idea of “love of fate,” meaning you don’t want anything to be different — not the past, the future, or forever — feels more true to you.

There’s no one to save, no one to help realize themselves, no one to wake up. Either you will understand the idea of eternal return or you won’t.

What adventures will you have? No one can say. They’re inside you, and only you can follow your spirit.
