No matter how tall you are, many people still have to look up to you: your boat won’t stay stuck on dry land for much longer.

We, the ones who used to feel hopeless, have now come to your cave and we don’t lose hope anymore. This is a sign that better people are coming to you. They are the last piece of God among humans — all the people who feel deep desire, deep disgust, and deep fullness. They don’t want to live unless they learn to hope again, and they want to learn that hope from you, Zarathustra, the great hope!

The king on the right said this and grabbed Zarathustra’s hand to kiss it, but Zarathustra stopped him and stepped back, scared, quietly and suddenly moving far away. After a little while, he came back to his guests, looked at them carefully, and said, “My guests, you higher men, I will speak clearly and honestly with you. I did not wait here in these mountains for you.”

(“Clearly and honestly?” thought the king on the left. “Oh man, this wise man from the East doesn’t know us Westerners! But he means ‘straight talk’ — well, that’s not so bad these days!”)

Zarathustra continued, “You may all be higher men, but for me, you are not high or strong enough. I speak for the unstoppable force inside me, which is quiet now but won’t be forever. Even if you belong to me, you are not my strongest helpers.

Those who stand on weak and shaky legs mostly want to be treated gently, whether they realize it or not. But I don’t treat my arms and legs gently, nor do I treat my warriors gently. So how could you be ready for my battles?

If I fought with you, I would ruin all my victories. Many of you would fall if you heard the loud beating of my war drums.

Besides, you are not beautiful or noble enough for me. I need pure, clear mirrors for my ideas; on your surface, even my own image looks twisted.

You carry many burdens and memories on your shoulders; many tricky thoughts hide in your minds. There are many ordinary people hidden inside you too.
