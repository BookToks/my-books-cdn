Oh, the mess inside people’s souls!

Oh, the sad feeling of being too full of yourself!

They call it marriage, and say their marriages are perfect, made in heaven.

But I don’t like that kind of heaven! No, I don’t like those people stuck in those so-called perfect marriages!

I don’t want anything to do with a God who blesses things he didn’t make equal!

Don’t laugh at these marriages! Hasn’t every kid cried because of their parents?

This man seemed strong and ready for life, but when I saw his wife, I thought the world was full of crazies.

Yes, I wish the world would shake when a good person and a fool get married.

One man went out to find truth like a hero, but all he got was a small fake story: he calls it his marriage.

Another was careful and picky. But one mistake ruined everything: he calls it his marriage.

Someone else wanted a perfect wife, like an angel. But suddenly he became a servant to his wife, and now he would need to be an angel too.

I’ve met all kinds of people who buy wives, and they all think they’re smart. But even the smartest one buys his wife without really seeing her.

You call many short mistakes love. And your marriage ends many short mistakes with one long foolishness.

Your love for a woman, and her love for a man—oh, I wish it was about understanding pain and hidden gods! But usually two animals just fall on each other.

Even your best love is only a strong feeling and a painful fire. It’s a light to guide you to better places.

One day you will love beyond yourselves! But first, you have to learn how to love. And that’s why you had to taste the bitterness of love.

Even the best love is bitter; that’s what makes you want something greater; that’s what makes you, the creative one, thirsty for more.

Thirst in the creator, a desire for the greater person: tell me, my brother, is this what you want from marriage?

I call that a holy desire and a true marriage. That’s what Zarathustra said.

Many people die too late, and some die too early.
