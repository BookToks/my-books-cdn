Unmoved is my depth: but it sparkles with swimming enigmas and laughter.
 
 A sublime one saw I today, a solemn one, a penitent of the spirit: Oh, how my soul laughed at his ugliness!
 
 With upraised breast, and like those who draw in their breath: thus did he stand, the sublime one, and in silence: Overhung with ugly truths, the spoil of his hunting, and rich in torn raiment; many thorns also hung on him - but I saw no rose.
 
 Not yet had he learned laughing and beauty. Gloomy did this hunter return from the forest of knowledge.
 
 From the fight with wild beasts returned he home: but even yet a wild beast gazes out of his seriousness - an unconquered wild beast!
 
 As a tiger does he ever stand, on the point of springing; but I do not like those strained souls; ungracious is my taste towards all those self-engrossed ones.
 
 And you tell me, friends, that there is to be no dispute about taste and tasting? But all life is a dispute about taste and tasting!
 
 Taste: that is weight at the same time, and scales and weigher; and alas for every living thing that would live without dispute about weight and scales and weigher!
 
 Should he become weary of his sublimeness, this sublime one, then only will his beauty begin - and then only will I taste him and find him savoury.
 
 And only when he turns away from himself will he overleap his own shadow - and truly! into his sun.
 
 Far too long did he sit in the shade; the cheeks of the penitent of the spirit became pale; he almost starved on his expectations.
 
 Contempt is still in his eye, and loathing hides in his mouth. To be sure, he now rests, but he has not yet taken rest in the sunshine.
 
 As the ox ought he to do; and his happiness should smell of the earth, and not of contempt for the earth.
 
 As a white ox would I like to see him, which, snorting and lowing, 95 walks before the plough-share: and his lowing should also laud all that is earthly!
