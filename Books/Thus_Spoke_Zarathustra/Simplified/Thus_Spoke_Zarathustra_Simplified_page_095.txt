Deep inside, I don’t change, but I sparkle with mysterious thoughts and laughter.

Today I saw someone very serious and thoughtful, someone who felt sorry deep inside. Oh, how my soul laughed at how ugly he looked!

He stood tall, like someone holding their breath, silent and serious. He carried ugly truths he had found, wearing torn clothes and covered in thorns—but I didn’t see any beauty.

He hadn’t yet learned how to laugh or be beautiful. He came back from the forest of knowledge feeling dark and sad.

He returned from fighting wild beasts, but a wild beast still showed in his serious eyes—one that hadn’t been tamed!

Like a tiger ready to jump, he always stood tense; but I don’t like people who are so serious and full of themselves.

And you tell me, friends, that no one should argue about what they like? But life is all about arguing over what tastes good and what doesn’t!

Taste is like a scale that weighs things, and sadly, every living thing has to argue about what’s right to like.

If this serious person ever got tired of being so serious, that’s when he would start to be beautiful—and that’s when I would enjoy him.

Only when he stops thinking about himself will he rise above his own shadow and step into the light.

He spent too long hiding in the shadows; his face became pale from feeling sorry, almost starving on his hopes.

There is still disgust in his eyes and hate hiding on his lips. Sure, he rests now, but he hasn’t yet found peace in the sunshine.

He should be like an ox, strong and simple, and his happiness should come from the earth, not from looking down on it.

I want to see him like a white ox, breathing hard and walking proudly in front of the plow, and his sounds should praise everything on earth!
