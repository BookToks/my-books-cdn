But the wind, which we can’t see, moves and bends the tree as it leans. We are most troubled and bent by invisible forces." Then the young man stood up, confused, and said: "I hear Zarathustra’s words, and I was just thinking about him!"

Zarathustra replied: "Why are you scared because of that? People are like trees. The more they try to reach up to the light and be great, the harder their roots pull them down into the dark and bad things."

"Yes, into the bad!" shouted the young man. "How did you know what’s inside me?" Zarathustra smiled and said: "Many souls you can’t understand unless you first imagine them." "Yes, into the bad!" the young man said again.

"You’re right, Zarathustra. I don’t trust myself anymore since I tried to be great, and no one trusts me either; why is that?

I change too fast: who I am today proves I was wrong yesterday. I often skip steps when I climb; but none of the steps forgive me for that.

When I reach the top, I’m always alone. No one talks to me; the cold loneliness makes me shake. What am I even looking for at the top?

My hate and my desire grow together; the higher I climb, the more I hate the person climbing too. What is he looking for at the top?

I’m so embarrassed by how I climb and fall! I laugh at my heavy breathing! I hate the one who flies! I’m so tired at the top!" The young man then fell silent.

Zarathustra looked at the tree next to them and said: "This tree stands alone on the hill; it has grown taller than any man or animal.

If it could talk, no one would understand it: it’s grown so high.

Now it waits and waits—what is it waiting for? It’s so close to the clouds; maybe it’s waiting for the first lightning?"

After Zarathustra said this, the young man shouted with strong emotions: "Yes, Zarathustra, you speak the truth. When I wanted to be at the top, I actually wanted to destroy myself, and you are the lightning I was waiting for!"
