Your true self is your real goodness. The ring’s need is inside you: every ring tries hard to find itself again and keeps turning around.

Just like a star that goes out, every good thing you do is always shining and moving — and when will it stop moving?

So the light of your goodness is still traveling, even after your work is finished. Even if people forget it or it seems gone, its light keeps going.

Your goodness is your true self, not something outside like clothes or a mask. That’s the real truth for those who are good! But some people think being good means suffering a lot, and you’ve listened to them too much!

Others say being good means being lazy about their bad habits; when their anger and jealousy calm down, their idea of “justice” wakes up and rubs its eyes.

Some people are pulled down by their bad sides. But the more they fall, the stronger their eyes shine and the more they long for their God.

Their complaints have reached you too: “What I’m not, that’s God and goodness to me!” Others move slowly and heavily, like carts going downhill; they talk a lot about honor and goodness — but dragging themselves, they call that goodness!

Some people are like old clocks that tick when wound up; they tick and want people to believe their ticking is goodness.

I find those funny: when I find these clocks, I wind them up with my jokes, and they start whirring!

Some people are proud of a little bit of rightness and do bad things because of it, making the world full of wrong.

How badly they say the word “goodness”! When they say, “I am just,” it sounds like, “I’m just getting revenge!” They use their goodness to hurt their enemies, and they raise themselves up just to put others down.

Then there are people who just sit quietly in their swamp and say, “Goodness is sitting still.

We don’t hurt anyone and stay away from those who might hurt us; and we always believe what we’re told.” And there are others who think being good is just about having the right attitude.
