Oh, you fake sentimental people, you jealous ones! You don’t have pure feelings in what you want, and now you’re saying wanting things is bad because of that!

You don’t really love the earth like people who create new life or truly enjoy it do!

Where is innocence? It’s where there is the will to create life. And anyone who wants to make something beyond themselves has the purest will in my eyes.

Where is beauty? It’s where I have to use my whole willpower; where I’m ready to love and even die so that something real, not just a picture, can exist.

Loving and dying have always gone together. To want to love means being ready to die too. That’s what I say to you scared people!

But now you weak watchers call your staring “thinking!” And what you can look at with scared eyes you call “beautiful!” Oh, you ruiners of good words!

But here’s your curse, you “pure” ones, you who think you see clearly—you will never create anything, even if you lie there full and wide.

You fill your mouths with fancy words, and we’re supposed to believe your hearts are full too, you tricksters?

My words are poor and awkward, but I’m happy to pick up what you leave behind at your fancy feasts.

Still, I can tell the truth to you fakers! Yes, my broken words will annoy you!

Bad vibes are always around you and your feasts: your dirty thoughts, your lies, and secrets fill the air!

Only dare to believe in yourselves—your true selves inside! Anyone who doesn’t believe in themselves is always lying.

You “pure” ones wear a god’s mask in front of you, but a disgusting snake is hidden inside that mask.

You trick yourselves, you “deep thinkers!” Even Zarathustra once fell for your godlike looks; he didn’t see the snake hidden inside.

I once thought I saw a god’s soul playing in your games, you clear-seeing ones! I once dreamed there was no better art than yours!

But there was snake filth and a bad smell, and a sneaky lizard’s craft lurking nearby in a dirty way.

But I got close to you, then the truth came to me—and now it’s coming to you too—the moon’s love story is over!

Look there!
