And honestly, I love you because you don’t know how to live right now, you higher people! Because this is how you live best!

Do you have courage, my brothers? Are you really brave? Not the kind of courage you show when others are watching, but the kind that’s quiet and strong, the kind even a god can’t see anymore.

I don’t call cold hearts, stubborn people, the blind, or the drunk brave. Someone is brave who feels fear but beats it; who looks into the deep scary pit but stands proud.

The one who looks into the pit with sharp eagle eyes—the one who grabs the pit with eagle claws—that person has courage.

“People are bad,” the smartest people told me to make me feel better. Oh, I wish that was still true! Because being bad is a person’s strongest power.

I say, “People need to get better and also worse.” The worst stuff is needed for the best kind of person.

Maybe it was good for the preachers of regular people to suffer and feel guilty for others’ sins. But I am happy about big sins—they make me feel better. But don’t say this to people who can’t handle it. Not every word is for every person. These are deep ideas; sheep’s feet can’t grab them!

You higher people, do you think I’m here to fix what you messed up?

Or that I want to make easier, softer lives for you who suffer? Or show you who are lost new, easier paths?

No! No! No! More and better people like you will always fall—because your life must get harder and worse. Only this way do people grow tall enough to be struck and shattered by lightning: high enough for the lightning!

My soul and my search go to the few, the strong, the far away: your small, short troubles don’t matter to me!

You don’t suffer enough for me! You suffer because of yourselves, but not enough because of others. You’d be lying if you said otherwise! None of you has suffered like I have.

It’s not enough for me that lightning doesn’t hurt anymore.
