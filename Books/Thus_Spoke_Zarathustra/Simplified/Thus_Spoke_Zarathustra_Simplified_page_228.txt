What has been the biggest mistake people have made on earth so far? Wasn’t it said by someone, "Woe to those who laugh now!" Did that person ever find a reason to laugh on earth? If not, then they were looking in the wrong place. Even a child can find a reason to laugh.

He didn’t love enough; otherwise, he would have loved us, the laughing people! But instead, he hated and mocked us; he promised us sadness and anger.

Does not loving someone mean you have to curse them right away? That seems rude to me. But that’s what this person, who thought he was the absolute one, did. He came from the common people.

And he himself didn’t love enough; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so angry that people didn’t love him back. True love doesn’t just want love in return—it wants more.

Stay away from people like that! They are sick and unhappy, like ordinary people who see life with hate and have bad feelings about the world.

Stay away from those kinds of people! They are heavy and sad inside—they don’t know how to have fun. How can the earth feel light and happy to them?

Good things don’t come easily. Like cats, they arch their backs and quietly purr when they get closer to happiness—all good things laugh.

You can tell if someone is on their true path by how they walk: just watch me! But people who are near their goal actually dance.

I’m not a statue, not stiff or dumb like a rock; I love running fast.

Even if there are muddy places and hard struggles on earth, someone with light feet can run across the mud and dance like they’re on smooth ice.

Lift your spirits high, my friends, higher and higher! And don’t forget your legs! Lift your legs too, good dancers, and even better if you stand on your heads!

This crown of laughter, this crown made of roses: I put it on myself, I chose to honor my laughter. Today, I didn’t find anyone else strong enough to wear it.

Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one, who waves his wings, ready to fly, calling all birds who are ready too, happy and carefree: Zarathustra the wise one, Zarathustra the one who laughs truthfully, not impatient or strict, one who loves to jump and dance; I put on this crown myself!
