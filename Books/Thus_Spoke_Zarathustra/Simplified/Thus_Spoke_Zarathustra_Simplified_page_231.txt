But already this sad, gloomy feeling is coming to me, like a shadow at sunset. It’s a strange kind of sadness, maybe a boy or a girl—I don’t know yet—but it’s coming, and it’s holding me tight. Hey, open your eyes and your mind!

The day is ending, and everything is moving into evening, even the best things. Listen and watch, you smart people, to see what kind of spirit this evening sadness really is! The old wise man said this, looked around carefully, and then picked up his harp.

In the clear evening air, when the gentle dew falls softly on the earth, quietly and without sound—

For those wearing soft shoes, the cool dew feels kind and gentle. Think about it, burning heart, remember how once you longed for the kind tears from the sky and the gentle drops of dew, feeling tired and thirsty.

Back then, on yellow grassy paths, the bright, harsh sunlight peeked through dark trees, shining so brightly it almost hurt.

“Are you really a lover of truth?” they mocked. “No! Just a poet!”

A sneaky, wild creature who always lies, who lies on purpose, just to get what they want. Wearing a colorful disguise, hiding who they really are, only caring about their own gain.

Are they really a lover of truth? No! Just a fool! Just a poet!

Just colorful words coming from a confused fool, shouting nonsense, walking on made-up bridges of words, on rainbow-like arches between fake heavens and fake earth, flying and circling around us—just a fool!
