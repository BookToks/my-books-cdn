Maybe my wisdom quietly talked to it, my happy, clear-thinking wisdom that laughs at the idea of endless worlds. It says: "Where there is power, numbers become the boss: the one with more power wins." My dream looked at this limited world with confidence—not in a new way, not in an old way, not shyly, not begging.

It was like a big, round apple appeared in my hand, a ripe golden apple with soft, smooth skin. That’s how the world showed itself to me. Like a tree nodding to me, wide-branched and strong, shaped like a chair and footstool for tired travelers—that’s how the world stood before me. Like gentle hands bringing me a small box, open for quiet, loving eyes—that’s how the world appeared today.

The world wasn’t a mystery scary enough to push people away, nor a puzzle easy enough to put wisdom to sleep. Today, the world felt like a good, human thing, even though people say bad things about it.

I’m really thankful to my morning dream that, at dawn today, I measured the world! This dream and comfort in my heart made the world feel good to me.

Now, to do the same during the day and copy its best parts, I’ll put the three worst things on the scales and weigh them fairly. The one who taught us to bless also taught us to curse: what are the three worst cursed things in the world? These are the ones I’ll weigh.

Lust, hunger for power, and selfishness: these three have been cursed the most and have the worst and most false reputations. I will weigh these three fairly.

Okay! Here I am on my cliff, and there is the sea—it rolls toward me, wild and eager, like a loyal, many-headed dog-monster that I love! Here I will hold the scales over the restless sea. I also choose a witness to watch— you, lonely tree, strong-smelling and wide-arched, the tree I love!

What bridge takes the now to the future? What makes the high bow down to the low? And what makes even the tallest keep growing up? Now the scales are balanced and still: I’ve placed three heavy questions on one side and three heavy answers on the other.
