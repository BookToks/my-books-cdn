Would you like to see the tarantula itself? Here hangs its web: touch it, so it will shake.

The tarantula comes willingly: Welcome, tarantula! You have a black triangle on your back as a symbol; and I also know what you feel inside.

Revenge is in your heart: wherever you bite, a black scab appears; your poison makes the soul dizzy with revenge!

This is how I speak to you in riddles, you who make souls dizzy, you preachers of equality! To me, you are tarantulas, secretly full of revenge!

But soon I will expose your hiding spots: that’s why I laugh loudly in your face.

That’s why I tear your web, so your anger will pull you out of your lies, and your revenge will jump out from behind your word "justice." For me, saving people from revenge is the path to the greatest hope, like a rainbow after a long storm.

But the tarantulas want it their way. "Let justice fill the world with storms of our revenge," they say to each other.

“We will use revenge and insult against everyone who is different from us,” the tarantulas promise each other.

“And ‘Will to Equality’ will be the new name of goodness; we will shout against all power!” You preachers of equality, the angry weakness inside you screams for "equality": your secret wish to control hides behind words about virtue!

Nervous pride and hidden jealousy – maybe your fathers had this too: it breaks out in you as fire and wild revenge.

What the father hides comes out in the son; often I see the son revealing the father’s secret.

They seem inspired: but it’s not their heart that inspires them, it’s revenge. When they become cold and clever, it’s not spirit, but envy that makes them so.

Their jealousy also leads them to become thinkers; this shows their jealousy – they always go too far, until they are so tired they fall asleep in the snow.

In all their complaints, you can hear revenge; in all their praises is evil; and being the judge feels like happiness to them.
