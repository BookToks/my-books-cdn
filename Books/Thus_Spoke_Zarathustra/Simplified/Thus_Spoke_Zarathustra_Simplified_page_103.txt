"So, I heard you say that before," the student said, "and then you added: 'But poets lie too much.' Why did you say poets lie too much?"

"Why?" Zarathustra asked. "You want to know why? I’m not someone who needs to explain why.

Is my experience something new? No, I’ve known the reasons for my thoughts for a long time.

Should I be like a barrel that holds every memory just to have reasons with me?

It’s already hard enough for me to keep my opinions; many ideas fly away.

Sometimes, I even find a strange creature in my home that doesn’t belong there and shakes when I touch it.

But what did Zarathustra once say to you? That poets lie too much?

- But Zarathustra is also a poet.

Do you think he was telling the truth? Why do you believe it?" The student said, "I believe in Zarathustra." But Zarathustra shook his head and smiled.

Belief doesn’t make me holy, he said, especially not believing in myself.

But if someone seriously said that poets lie too much, they were right—we do lie too much.

We also don’t know enough and aren’t good at learning, so we end up lying.

Which poet hasn’t changed their words? Many strange and mixed things have come out of our minds.

Because we know little, we really like simple people, especially when they’re young women!

We even want the things old women tell each other at night. We call this the “eternally feminine” inside us.

And it’s like there’s a special secret to knowing things that disappears when you actually learn something, so we believe in people and their “wisdom.”
