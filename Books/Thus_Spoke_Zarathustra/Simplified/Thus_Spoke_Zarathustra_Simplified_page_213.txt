Ah, where is the innocent feeling I used to have, the kind of innocence that comes with being good and telling kind lies?

I often chased after the truth, but it hurt me like a kick in the face. Sometimes I tried to lie, but then I only ended up telling the truth.

Too many things have become clear to me now, and I don’t care anymore. Nothing I love is alive, so how can I still love myself?

“I want to live how I feel, or not live at all,” that’s what I wish, and even the purest souls wish that. But sadly, do I still have any real desires?

Do I still have a goal? A safe place I’m heading toward?

A good breeze? Only someone who knows where they’re going can tell which wind is good and which is fair.

What do I have left? A tired, restless heart; a shaky will; fluttering wings; and a weak backbone.

This search for my home—Oh Zarathustra, do you know that this searching has made me sick at heart? It’s eating me up.

“Where is my home?” That’s what I ask and look for, but I haven’t found it. Oh forever everywhere, oh forever nowhere, oh forever in vain!” The shadow said this, and Zarathustra’s face grew serious. “You are my shadow!” he said sadly at last.

“Your danger is big, you free spirit and wanderer! You’ve had a bad day—make sure the evening isn’t even worse!

People like you, who are so unsettled, might even think prisoners are lucky.

Have you ever seen how captured criminals sleep? They sleep calmly, happy to be safe.

Be careful that one day a narrow belief traps you, a hard and strict false hope! Right now, everything that is narrow and fixed is tempting you.

You’ve lost your goal. Oh, how will you give up and forget that loss? Because of that—you’ve also lost your way!

You poor traveler and wanderer, you tired butterfly! Do you want to rest and have a home tonight? Then come to my cave!

This is the way to my cave. But now I will run away from you again. I feel like a shadow is already over me.

I will run alone so things can become bright around me once more. So I must keep moving happily for a long time. But in the evening, I will dance!” —That’s what Zarathustra said.

Zarathustra ran and ran, but found no one else. He was alone but kept finding himself again; he enjoyed his solitude and thought about good things—for hours.
