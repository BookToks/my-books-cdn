I’m learning to be more honest, and the more I learn, the more I see how important our bodies and the earth really are.

I’ve found a new kind of pride, and I want to teach others not to ignore the world around them or pretend it doesn’t matter. Instead, we should hold our heads high and see that life on earth has real meaning!

I want to teach people to follow the path humans have always taken, to accept it, and not to hide away from it like someone who’s sick and about to give up.

The sick and dying are the ones who looked down on their bodies and the earth, inventing ideas about heaven and saving blood. But even these ideas came from their own bodies and the earth!

They wanted to escape their pain, but the stars felt too far away. So they dreamed up secret ways and strange potions to sneak into a better life.

These ungrateful people imagined they were leaving their bodies and the earth behind. But the strong feelings they had came from their bodies and the earth itself.

Zarathustra is kind to those who are sick. He’s not mad at how they comfort themselves or how ungrateful they seem. He hopes they get better and grow stronger, making better bodies for themselves.

He’s also not mad at someone who still believes in their old ideas and quietly visits the grave of their God at night. Even their tears show they are hurting and weak.

There have always been sick people who make up stories and long for God. They hate those who are honest and question things.

They look back to darker times when faith and false beliefs were different. Back then, thinking too much was seen as godlike, and doubting was a sin.

I know these godlike people well: they demand to be believed and say doubt is wrong. But I also know what they truly believe in.

They don’t really believe in life after death or saving blood. What they believe in most is the body itself.

But to them, their bodies feel weak and sick, and they wish they could leave them behind.
