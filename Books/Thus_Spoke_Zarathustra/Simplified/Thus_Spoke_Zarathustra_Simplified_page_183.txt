The Honey Sacrifice

Many moons and years passed over Zarathustra’s soul, but he didn’t notice; his hair just turned white. One day, he sat on a stone outside his cave and looked calmly into the distance—like someone staring out at the sea and the deep, twisting valleys beyond.

His animals slowly gathered around him and finally stood right in front of him.

“O Zarathustra,” they said, “are you looking out there hoping to find happiness?”

“What does my happiness matter?” he answered. “I stopped chasing happiness a long time ago. Now, I work for my purpose.”

“O Zarathustra,” the animals said again, “you say that like someone who has too many good things. Aren’t you lying in a sky-blue lake of happiness?”

“You jokers,” Zarathustra smiled, “you picked the perfect image!”
