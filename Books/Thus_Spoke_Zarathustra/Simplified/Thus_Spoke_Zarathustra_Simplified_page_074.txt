All creators have a hard time. That’s what Zarathustra said.

One day, Zarathustra made a sign to his followers and said, “Here are priests. Even though they are my enemies, just pass by them quietly like you’re sleeping and ready to fight if needed.

Some of them are actually brave; many have been hurt a lot, so they want others to feel pain too.

They are bad enemies because their calmness is the most dangerous kind of revenge.

And anyone who messes with them will end up dirty.

But my roots are connected to theirs, and I want to see my roots respected in them.”

After they passed, Zarathustra felt a pain, but he didn’t fight it long before he started talking: “My heart feels for those priests. I don’t like them, but that’s not the main thing because I live among people.

I have suffered with them too; they are like prisoners to me, marked and judged. The one they call Savior trapped them with chains.

Chains made of false values and silly words! Oh, I wish someone would save them from their Savior!

They thought they reached a safe island when the sea tossed them around, but it was actually a sleeping monster!

False values and silly words are the worst monsters for people – they make them sleep and wait a long time.

But eventually, the monster wakes up and destroys everything built on it.

Look at the buildings those priests have made! They call their smelly caves churches!

Such fake light and stale air! The soul is not allowed to fly high.

But their belief says: “Get on your knees, go up the stairs, you sinners!” Honestly, I’d rather see someone proud than see people with shame and fake devotion in their eyes!
