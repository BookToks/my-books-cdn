You always have to be unclear, confusing, and tricky! Even what you just admitted isn’t true enough or false enough for me!

You dishonest liar, how could you act any other way? You would even try to hide your sickness if you showed yourself to your doctor without hiding anything.

That’s how you tried to cover up your lie when you said: “I did it just for fun!” There was some seriousness in that, you actually feel a little sorry deep down!

I understand you well: you have fooled the whole world; but for yourself, you have no lies or tricks left—you see yourself clearly and without illusions!

You have only gained disgust as your one real feeling. Nothing you say is honest anymore, but your mouth shows it—that is, the disgust that sticks to your lips.

“Who are you anyway!” shouted the old magician loudly, “Who dares to talk to me, the greatest man alive?” A green flash shot from his eyes at Zarathustra. But then he changed and said sadly: “Oh Zarathustra, I am tired of it all, I hate my tricks, I am not great, why am I pretending? But you already know—I wanted to be great!

I wanted to seem like a great man and convinced many people; but the lie was too strong for me. Because of it, I am falling apart.

Oh Zarathustra, everything in me is a lie, but this falling apart—that is real!” 

“That’s something good about you,” said Zarathustra sadly, looking away, “it shows you tried to be great, but it also shows you failed. You’re not great.

Old magician, the best and most honest thing about you is that you are tired of yourself and said: ‘I am not great.’ Because of that, I respect you as someone who feels sorry inside, and for a brief moment, you were real.

But tell me, what do you want here in my forests and rocks? And if you came to me, what proof do you want from me? How did you test me?” Zarathustra said, his eyes shining. The old magician was quiet for a while, then said: “Did I test you? I’m just searching.

Oh Zarathustra, I’m looking for someone real, honest, simple, clear, a person who is perfectly honest, full of wisdom, a kind of holy person, a great man!”
