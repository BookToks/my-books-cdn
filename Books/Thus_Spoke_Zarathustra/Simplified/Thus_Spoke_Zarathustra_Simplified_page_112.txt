I have seen worse things before, and some really ugly stuff that I don’t want to talk about or just keep quiet about. Like men who don’t have much except too much of one thing – men who are just a big eye, or a big mouth, or a big belly, or something else that’s too big. I call these men “reversed cripples.”

When I left my alone time and crossed this bridge for the first time, I couldn’t believe what I saw. I kept looking again and again, and finally said, “That’s an ear! An ear as big as a man!” Then I saw that under the ear was something small and weak. The huge ear was sitting on a thin stalk – and that stalk was a man! If you looked closely, you could even see a tiny jealous face and a small sad soul hanging there. People told me this big ear was not just a man but a great man, a genius. But I never believed what people said about great men. I still think he was a reversed cripple, with too little of everything and too much of one thing.

When Zarathustra said this to the hunchback and those who spoke for him, he turned to his followers feeling very sad and said, “Friends, I walk among men like I’m walking among broken pieces of people!”

The terrible thing I see is that people are broken and scattered like after a battle or on a butcher’s floor.

When I look at the past and the present, I see the same thing: broken pieces, bad luck, but no real whole people!

The past and present on earth – oh friends – that is the hardest thing for me. I wouldn’t know how to live if I wasn’t someone who can see the future.

A seer, a planner, a creator, the future itself, a bridge to the future, and sadly, also like a cripple standing on this bridge – that is Zarathustra.

And you also asked yourselves, “Who is Zarathustra to us? What should we call him?” And like me, you asked questions to find answers.

Is he someone who makes promises? Or someone who keeps them? A winner? Or someone who gets what others leave behind? A harvest? Or a tool for farming? A doctor? Or someone who is healed?

Is he a poet? Or a real one? Someone who frees people? Or someone who controls them? A good one?
