Some people act like they’re something they’re not, without even realizing it. Real, honest people are super rare, especially real actors.

There isn’t much real manliness here, so women end up acting more like men. Only a man who’s truly strong and real can protect the woman in her true self.

The worst thing I noticed was that even the people in charge pretend to have the good qualities of those who serve them.

They keep saying, “I serve, you serve, we serve,” but it’s just fake, even from the leaders. And sadly, if the top boss is just the top servant, that’s not good.

I was curious about their fake behavior, and I understood all their fake happiness and how they buzz around like flies near a sunny window.

I see so much kindness but also weakness. So much fairness and pity, but also weakness.

They treat each other nicely, like smooth, round grains of sand that don’t hurt each other.

Being okay with a little bit of happiness—that’s what they call “submission.”

At the same time, they quietly look for a new little happiness.

Deep down, they just want one thing: not to get hurt. So, they try to guess what everyone wants and do good for everyone.

But that’s really just being scared, even though they call it “virtue.” When they speak harshly, it sounds like their voices are weak and worn out, like every breath makes them hoarse.

They are clever; their good qualities are smart. But they don’t have the strength to really fight back; their fingers don’t know how to hide behind fists.

For them, being good means being quiet and tame. That’s how they turned wolves into dogs, and humans into obedient pets.

They say with a smirk, “We sit in the middle, far from dying fighters and happy pigs.” But that’s just being average, even if they call it “moderation.”

I walk among these people and say a lot, but they don’t know how to listen or remember.

They wonder why I didn’t come to scold them for their bad behavior; honestly, I didn’t come to warn about thieves either!

They’re surprised I don’t want to help and encourage their “wisdom,” like they don’t already have enough know-it-alls whose voices annoy me like nails on a chalkboard.
