There are still many empty seats for people who are alone or with just one other person, surrounded by the calm and quiet feeling of the sea.

Living freely is still possible for great people. Really, the less you own, the less you are controlled by things. Being a little poor can be a good thing!

Where the government ends, the real person begins – the one who truly matters. That’s where the song of the important, unique people starts.

Where the government stops, look there, my friends! Can you see the rainbow and the bridges to becoming something greater? That’s what Zarathustra said.

Part 1, (12) THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE Run away, my friend, to your own quiet space! I see you overwhelmed by the loudness of important people and hurt by the annoying small-minded ones.

The forest and rocks know how to be quiet with you in a perfect way.

Be like the tree you love, the one with big branches – silently watching over the sea.

Where quiet ends, the busy marketplace begins; and where the marketplace starts, so does the noise of famous people and the buzz of annoying flies.

Even the best things mean nothing without people to show them off: those showmen are what people call great men.

Most people don’t really get what greatness is – that is, the power to create. But they love the showmen and actors who pretend to be great.

The world secretly spins around the people who invent new values. But the crowd and fame spin around the actors – that’s how things go.

The actor has spirit, but little true awareness of it. He always believes most in himself!

Tomorrow he’ll believe something new, and the day after, something new again. Like regular people, he notices things quickly and changes his moods.

For him, to upset someone means to prove a point. To drive someone crazy means to convince them. And to him, violence is the strongest argument of all.
