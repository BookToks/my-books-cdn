Or am I something bad?

I walk among people like pieces of the future—the future I think about.

And my goal is to put together all the broken, confusing, and scary parts into one whole.

How could I stand being human if humans weren’t also creators, puzzle-solvers, and those who change chances?

To fix what happened before, and to turn every "It was" into "This is how I want it!"—that’s what I call true fixing!

Willpower—that’s what brings freedom and happiness. I’ve taught you that, my friends! But now, learn this too: even Willpower is still trapped.

Wanting things frees us, but what keeps the thing that frees us locked up?

"It was": that’s what the pain and loneliness of Willpower is called. It’s powerless against what already happened—it can only watch the past badly.

Willpower can’t want what’s already done; it can’t change time or what time wants—that’s its deepest pain.

Wanting frees us: but what does wanting itself do to escape its pain and laugh at its prison?

Ah, every prisoner becomes a fool! Willpower, even trapped, can be foolish too.

Time doesn’t go backward—that’s its enemy. "What happened" is the heavy stone it can’t move.

So it throws stones out of anger and bad moods, taking revenge on anything that doesn’t feel the same anger.

That’s how Willpower, the one who frees, became a torturer; and it takes revenge on all who can hurt because it can’t go back.

This, yes, this is revenge itself: Willpower’s hate for time and for "It was." Truly, a big foolishness lives in our Willpower; and it became a curse for all people when this foolishness got a spirit!

The spirit of revenge: my friends, that’s been humanity’s deepest thought so far; and where there was pain, people said there had to be punishment.

"Punishment," that’s what revenge calls itself. It lies and pretends to have a clean conscience.

And because the one who wants suffers, because he can’t wish the past away—so wanting itself, and all life, was called a punishment!
