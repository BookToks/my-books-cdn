They looked down into the fountain, then looked up at me with a disgusting smile coming from the water.

They have ruined the holy water with their dirty desires; when they called their nasty dreams happiness, they also ruined the meaning of words.

The flame gets angry when they try to warm their cold, wet hearts; even the spirit starts to bubble and smoke when the worthless crowd comes near the fire.

The fruit in their hands becomes mushy and too soft; their look makes the fruit tree shaky and withered at the top.

Many people who have turned away from life did it because they didn’t want to be with the crowd; they hated sharing the fountain, the fire, and the fruit with them.

Many who went into the wild and suffered thirst with wild animals only didn’t want to sit by the water with dirty camel drivers.

Some who came like destroyers and storms to all the fields just wanted to stop the crowd by putting their foot in their mouths.

What bothered me the most wasn’t that life needs enemies, death, and pain; it was when I asked myself, almost suffocating, “Is the crowd really necessary for life?”

Are poisoned fountains, stinky fires, dirty dreams, and worms in the bread of life really necessary?

It wasn’t hate, but disgust that ate away at my life! I often felt tired inside when I found even the crowd had some spirit.

I turned my back on the rulers when I saw what they called ruling: trading and making deals for power with the crowd!

I lived among people speaking a strange language, with my ears closed, so their language of deals and power wouldn’t make sense to me.

Holding my nose, I sadly went through all the past and present days: honestly, the past and present days of the scribbling crowd all smell bad!

Like someone crippled who became deaf, blind, and mute, I lived a long time so I wouldn’t have to live with the power-crowd, the writer-crowd, and the fun-crowd.

My spirit climbed stairs slowly and carefully; small moments of joy kept me going; life moved slowly like a blind person using a cane.

What has happened to me?
