Keep your biggest dreams sacred! That’s what Zarathustra said.

There are people who tell others to give up on life. The world is full of those who are told to stop living fully.

The earth is crowded with people who don’t really need to be here; life is messed up because there are just too many. Maybe these people should be tempted to leave this life by promises of “eternal life.”

These death-preachers are called “the yellow ones” or “the black ones.” But I will show you they come in other types too.

Some are scary because they carry a wild animal inside them. They only know two choices: giving in to their desires or hurting themselves. Even their desires hurt them.

They aren’t really grown up yet; they are still dangerous. Let them tell others to stop living, and then let them disappear themselves!

Some are losing their spirit; they start dying inside as soon as they’re born. They want to follow ideas about giving up and being tired of life.

They wish they were dead, and maybe we should agree with them! But we must be careful not to wake these half-dead people or hurt those who are barely alive.

When they see someone sick, old, or dead, they say, “Life is worthless!” But really, they are the ones who are wrong because they only see one side of life.

They are stuck in deep sadness and wait for small things that could end their life. They bite their lips tight.

Or they grab at small pleasures and laugh at themselves like kids. They hold on to life by a thread but make fun of still wanting it.

Their “wisdom” says: “You’re dumb if you stay alive; we are the fools for living! Staying alive is the dumbest thing!” Others say, “Life is just pain,” and that’s true. So if life is only pain, then stop living!

And this should be your rule: “You must end yourself! You must escape from yourself!” Some say, “Desire is a sin,” and so they preach death, saying, “Let’s separate and have no children!”
