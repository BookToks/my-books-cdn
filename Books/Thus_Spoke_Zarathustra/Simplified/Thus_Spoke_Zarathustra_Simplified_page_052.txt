At first, people thought of groups of people, not just individuals. Actually, the individual is the newest idea.

Groups made lists of what is good. They created rules about love that leads and love that follows.

People have always enjoyed being part of a group more than just thinking about themselves. When people feel good about their group, their bad feelings only come from thinking about themselves.

The selfish person who only cares about their own gain, even if it helps others, didn’t start groups—they actually break them apart.

It was always the loving and creative people who decided what is good and bad. Love is the spark behind all good qualities, and anger is behind some bad ones.

Zarathustra traveled to many lands and met many people. He never found anything stronger than the ideas made by loving people, called “good” and “bad.”

It’s amazing how powerful praise and blame are. So tell me, who can control this power? Who can stop this wild animal with many heads?

There have been many goals because there have been many groups of people. But what’s missing is one goal for everyone—a single goal. Humanity doesn’t have a common goal yet.

But tell me, if humanity doesn’t have a goal, does humanity even exist? That’s what Zarathustra asked.

Part 1, (16) LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR

You all gather close to your neighbors and say nice things about it. But I say your love for your neighbor is really just a bad kind of self-love.

You run away from yourself by sticking close to others and try to make that seem like a good thing. But I see through your “selflessness.” The “you” came before the “I.” The “you” was honored, but the “I” is not yet. So people crowd around others.

Am I telling you to love your neighbor? No, I’m telling you to run away from your neighbor and love those farthest away!

Loving people far away or even future people is better than just loving your neighbor. Loving ideas and dreams is even better than loving people.
