Since I have to soon ask something really big from people, I think it’s important to say who I am and what I stand for. People should already know this because I haven’t kept quiet about myself. But the difference between how important my mission is and how small-minded most people are is clear because nobody has really listened to me or understood me yet. I trust myself and what I believe in.

Because of this, even though I usually stay quiet and my instincts tell me not to brag, I have to say: Listen up! This is who I am. Most of all, don’t think I’m someone else!  

For example, I’m not some scary monster or a bad person. Actually, I’m the opposite of the kind of person people usually call “good.” Honestly, I’m proud of that. I follow the ideas of the thinker Dionysus, and I’d rather be wild and free like a satyr than a perfect saint. But just read this little book!

Maybe I’ve done something important, or maybe this book just shows this difference in a fun and kind way.  

This book is meant for very rare people. Maybe none of them are even alive yet. My time might come later. Some people are only understood after they’re gone.

To really get me and what I’m saying, you have to understand my seriousness and passion. You need to be honest with yourself, even when it’s hard. You have to be used to being above the noisy arguments about politics and nations. You have to not care if the truth helps you or hurts you. You need to be strong enough to ask the tough questions nobody else dares to ask, brave enough to face what’s forbidden, and ready to get lost in complicated ideas.
