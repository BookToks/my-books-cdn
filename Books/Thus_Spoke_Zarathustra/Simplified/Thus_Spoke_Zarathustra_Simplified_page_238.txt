Pause and think.

Wow, shout out to that whale, kind of like a big fish. If it made things comfy for its guest, that’s pretty cool! You probably get my smart reference, right? Cheers to its belly, if it ever had such a beautiful, peaceful place inside. Although, honestly, I’m not totally sure about that — I’m more doubtful than an old married woman from Europe.

I hope things get better!

Amen!

Here I am now, sitting in this tiny peaceful spot, like a sweet brown date fruit, dripping with gold. It’s perfect for a girl’s soft mouth, but even more for young, pure, cold, white, sharp front teeth. That’s what all the passionate date fruits dream of. Pause and think.

Now, like the southern fruits I just mentioned, I’m lying here surrounded by tiny flying bugs buzzing and playing around me. Also, even smaller, sillier, and naughtier wishes and daydreams are all around. And you, quiet, knowing little cats, Dudu and Suleika — round and mysterious, like a sphinx. I’m trying to express a lot in one word. Please forgive me, God, if I’m speaking wrong!
