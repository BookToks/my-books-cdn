FRANKLIN.

I couldn’t suggest breaking up our partnership because I felt I owed them for what they had already done and were still willing to do if they could. But if they failed to keep their part of the deal and we had to end the partnership, then I would feel free to accept help from my friends.

Things stayed like this for a while. Then one day, I said to my partner, "Maybe your dad is unhappy that you only have part of the business and doesn’t want to support two people like he would just one. Be honest with me—if that’s true, I’ll give you the whole business and try to manage on my own." He replied, "No, my dad is just disappointed because things didn’t work out. He can’t pay, and I don’t want to cause him any more trouble. I realize I’m not cut out to be a printer. I was trained as a farmer, so it was silly for me to come here at thirty years old and start learning a new job as an apprentice. Lots of people from my area are moving to North Carolina because the land there is really good. I’m thinking about doing that too."
