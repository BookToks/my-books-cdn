I honestly told him to give up the idea because it was impossible for him to succeed. Then he asked Roberts, a bookseller in Paternoster Row, if he could write a weekly paper like the Spectator, but Roberts didn’t agree to his terms.

As for me, I quickly got a job with Palmer, a well-known printer in Bartholomew-close, and worked there for almost a year. I worked really hard, but I spent almost everything I earned with Ralph.

This was another big mistake in my life, which I would want to fix if I could start over.
