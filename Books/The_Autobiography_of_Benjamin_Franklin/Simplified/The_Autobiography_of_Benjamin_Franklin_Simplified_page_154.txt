FRANKLIN.

He proved to me a good and loyal friend, and he helped a lot with the success of my shop. We did well together, and we both tried hard to make each other happy.

So, I fixed this big mistake I made when I was young as best as I could.

Our club didn’t meet at a tavern back then. We met at Mr. Grace’s house, where he gave us a room to use. One day, someone said that since we often talked about books during our meetings, it would be helpful to keep those books in the room so we could look them up when needed. By putting our books together, each member could use all the books, almost like having them all to themselves. Everyone liked the idea, so we brought books we could share and put them at the end of the clubroom.

There weren’t as many books as we thought there would be, and even though we used them a lot, there were still some problems.
