FRANKLIN. There were 121 Smiths, all part of the Assembly, and Isaac Decon, the inspector-general. Isaac was a smart and clever old man. He told me that when he was a boy, his first job was carrying clay to brick-makers. He didn’t learn to write until he was older. Later, he worked as an assistant to a surveyor who taught him the job. Because he worked hard, he finally made a good amount of money. One day, he said to me, "I think you will soon replace this man" (he meant Keimer) "and make a fortune in the business in Philadelphia." At that time, he didn’t know I planned to start my own business there or anywhere else.

These friends helped me a lot in the end, and I helped some of them too when I could. They have respected me ever since.

Before I tell you about how I started my business, I should explain what I believed about right and wrong back then. This way, you can understand how these ideas affected what happened later in my life.
