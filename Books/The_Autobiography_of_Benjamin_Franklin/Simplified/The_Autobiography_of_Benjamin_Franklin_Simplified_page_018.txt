FRANKLIN.
 
 tory of that province, as " a jpious and learned Englishman" if I rightly recollect his expressions. % I have been told of his having written a variety oflittle pieces; but there appears to be only one in print, which I met with many years ago. It was published in the year 16T5, and is in familiar verse, agreeably to the taste of the times and the country. The author addresses himself to the governors for the time being, speaks for liberty of conscience, and in favor of the anabaptists, quakers, and other sectaries, who had suffered persecution. To this persecution he attributes the wars with the natives, and other calamities which afflicted the country, regarding them as the judgments of God in punishment of so odious an offence, and he exhorts the government to the repeal of laws so contrary to charity. The poem appeared to be written with a manly freedom and a pleasing simplicity. I recollect the six concluding lines, though I have forgotten the order of words ofthe two first; the sense ofwhich was, that his censures were dictated by benevolence, and that, of consequence, he wished to be LITE Of DR.
