FRANKLIN.

I remember a history of that province written by "a pious and learned Englishman," if I remember his exact words. I have heard that he wrote many small pieces, but there seems to be only one printed that I found many years ago.

It was published in 1675 and was written in simple verse, which was popular at that time and place. The author talks directly to the governors, supporting freedom of religion and defending groups like the Anabaptists, Quakers, and others who were treated badly.

He says that the wars with the native people and other problems happened because of this unfair treatment, seeing them as Godâ€™s punishment. He asks the government to get rid of laws that go against kindness.

The poem feels honest and easy to understand. I remember the last six lines, even though I forgot the first two, which said his criticisms came from kindness and that he wanted to be liked.
