I kept going happily, but poor Keimer suffered a lot. He got tired of the plan and missed the good food of Egypt. Finally, he ordered a roast pig and invited me and two girls we knew to eat with him. But the pig was ready a little too early, and he couldn't resist eating it all before we got there.

During this time, I had started liking Miss Read. I really respected and cared for her, and I thought she felt the same way about me. But we were both very young, barely eighteen. Since I was about to go on a long trip, her mom thought it was better to slow things down. She believed that if we wanted to get married, it would be more proper to wait until I came back and was more settled in my work. Maybe she also doubted if my plans would really work out.

My closest friends then were Charles Osborne and Joseph Watson.
