I was worried my family would stop me if I tried to leave openly because my dad and brother were against me. So, I made a plan to leave secretly. My friend Collins helped me by arranging a trip with the captain of a small New York boat. He told the captain I was a young guy who had problems with a girl, and her parents wanted me to marry her, so I couldn’t show up or leave openly.

I sold some of my books to get a little money and quietly got on the boat. After three days, with good wind, I arrived in New York, about 300 miles from home. I was only seventeen, didn’t know anyone there, and had very little money.

I used to want to be a sailor, but that feeling was gone by then. Since I had learned a trade and thought I was a decent worker, I didn’t hesitate to look for a job.
