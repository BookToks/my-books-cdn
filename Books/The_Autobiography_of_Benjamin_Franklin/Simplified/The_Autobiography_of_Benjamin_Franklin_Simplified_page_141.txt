I'Al waiting, started a lawsuit against us. We promised to pay, but it was worrying because if the money wasn’t ready on time, the case would go to court, a judgment would be made, our hopes would be crushed, and we would be completely ruined. We might have to sell the type and press, maybe for only half their value, to pay off the debt.

In this tough situation, two true friends, who were really kind and generous, came to me separately without knowing about each other, and without me asking for help.

Each of them offered to give whatever money was needed so I could take control of the business, if that was possible. They didn’t want me to stay partners with Meredith because they said he was often seen drunk in the streets and gambling in bars, which hurt our reputation. These friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. I told them that as long as there was any chance Meredith would keep his promises, I would wait.
