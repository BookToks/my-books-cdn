Thor, I was also brought in and questioned by the council. Even though I couldn’t satisfy their questions, they just scolded me and let me go, probably thinking I was just an apprentice who had to keep my boss’s secrets.

When my brother was put in jail, I got really angry, even though we sometimes fought. While he was locked up, I took over running the paper. I was brave enough to put in some funny but sharp jokes against the leaders. My brother liked it a lot, but some people started to see me as a young troublemaker who liked to make fun of others.

When my brother got out of jail, the House of Assembly made a strict rule that said, “James Franklin can’t print the newspaper called the ‘New England Courant’ anymore.” At that moment, we gathered our friends at the printing shop to figure out what to do next. Some suggested we just change the paper’s name to get around the rule, but my brother saw ahead...
