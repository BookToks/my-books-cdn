I thought about the good times I had in Philadelphia and wanted to feel them again. So, I agreed to work for Mr. Denham, earning fifty pounds a year. This was less money than I made as a printer, but I had better chances ahead.

I said goodbye to printing, thinking it was for good, and focused on my new job. I spent all my time either going from house to house with Mr. Denham to buy things, packing them up, or helping the workers get things done. When everything was finally ready to ship, I had a few free days.

One day during this break, a man I only knew by name called for me. It was Sir William Wyndham. I went to his house. He had heard that I taught swimming to Wygate and another young man in just a few hours between Chelsea and Blackfriars.

His two sons were about to travel, and he wanted them to learn how to swim first. He asked me to teach them.
