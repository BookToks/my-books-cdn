FRANKLIN.

We landed near some old wooden fences, which we used for firewood because it was a cold night in October. We stayed there until morning, when someone in our group found out that the place we were at was Cooper's Creek, just a little above Philadelphia. We really noticed this as soon as we got out of the creek. We arrived on Sunday around eight or nine in the morning and got off at Market Street wharf.

I have told you the details of my trip, and now I will describe my first time entering this city. This way, you can see how different my beginnings were compared to how I ended up later.

When I got to Philadelphia, I was wearing my work clothes because my best clothes were still coming by sea. I was covered in dirt, my pockets were full of shirts and socks, I didn’t know anyone there, and I didn’t know where to find a place to stay. I was tired from walking and rowing, hadn’t slept all night, and was very hungry. All the money I had was one Dutch dollar and some small change, which I gave to LIFE OF DR.
