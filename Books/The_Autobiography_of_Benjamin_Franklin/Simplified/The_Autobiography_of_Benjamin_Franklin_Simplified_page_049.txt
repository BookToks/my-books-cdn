This book is my old favorite, Bunyan's Pilgrim, but in Dutch. It’s a beautiful copy printed on nice paper with detailed pictures made by copper plates. I had never seen it like this before, and it’s in the original language. Later, I found out it’s been translated into almost every European language. After the Bible, I believe it’s one of the most widely read books.

Honest John is the first person I know who mixed storytelling with conversations. This way of writing is really fun to read because during the most exciting parts, you feel like you’re actually there, listening to the talks.

De Foe copied this style well in his books like Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders. Richardson did the same in his book Pamela and others.

When we got close to the island, we saw we had reached a part of the coast where we couldn’t land because the waves were too strong and the shore was rocky. So, we dropped anchor and let out some rope.
