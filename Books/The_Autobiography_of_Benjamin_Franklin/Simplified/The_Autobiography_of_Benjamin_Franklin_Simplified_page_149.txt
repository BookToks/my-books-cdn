In Pennsylvania, someone bought the business and hired Keimer to run it, but Keimer died a few years later.

At that time in Philadelphia, my only competition was Bradford. He was comfortable with his life and didn’t really want to print many books. He only did printing work when workers offered to do it. He wasn’t trying to grow his business.

Bradford had one big advantage over me: he was in charge of the post office. People thought this meant he could get news faster. His paper was also believed to be better for advertisers, so he had way more ads than I did. This made him a lot of money but hurt my business.

I tried to get other papers and send out my own through the post, but it didn’t help. People just assumed I wasn’t good at it. The only way I could get the postboys to help me was by bribing them because Bradford was mean enough to stop them from working for me openly. This made things really hard for me.
