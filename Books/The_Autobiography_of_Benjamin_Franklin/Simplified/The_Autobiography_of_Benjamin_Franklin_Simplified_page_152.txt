Some people who were renting rooms from me moved out because we couldn’t agree anymore, so I ended up with the whole house to myself. After that, I decided not to rent rooms to anyone else.

This made me start thinking about getting married. I looked around and tried to find someone, but I soon realized that being a printer wasn’t seen as a good job. If I wanted a wife who had any other good qualities, I couldn’t expect to have much money.

At the same time, my young feelings often got the better of me. I got involved with some bad women who came my way. These relationships cost me money and caused problems, and I was always worried about hurting my health or catching a disease I feared the most. Luckily, I managed to avoid that danger.

I stayed friendly with Miss Read’s family because they had liked me since I lived in their house before. They often invited me over, asked for my advice, and I sometimes helped them with their problems.
