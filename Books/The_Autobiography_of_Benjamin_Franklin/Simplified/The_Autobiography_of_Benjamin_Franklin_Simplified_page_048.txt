FRANKLIN.

I had worked for old Mr. William Bradford, who was the first printer in Pennsylvania, but he had left because he argued with George Keith, the governor.

He couldn’t give me a job because he didn’t have much work and already had enough people. But he told me his son, a printer in Philadelphia, had just lost his main worker, Aquilla Rose, who died. He said if I went there, his son might hire me. Philadelphia was a hundred miles away.

I didn’t hesitate to take a boat to Amboy, the fastest way by sea, leaving my trunk and things to come later by the slower usual route. While crossing the bay, a sudden storm broke our old sails, stopped us from entering the Kill, and pushed us onto Long Island.

During the storm, a drunk Dutchman who was also on the boat fell into the sea. As he was sinking, I grabbed him by his shirt and saved him, pulling him back on board. Getting wet made him a bit less drunk, so he fell asleep after taking a book from his pocket and asking me to dry it.
