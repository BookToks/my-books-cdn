Behind him were two big books of poems he had written by hand. These were small, quick pieces he wrote for his friends. He made up his own shorthand, which he taught me, but since I never used it, I have forgotten it now.

He was a very religious man and often went to listen to the best preachers. He enjoyed writing down their sermons using the quick writing system he had created. He collected many volumes this way.

He also really liked politics, maybe a bit too much for his own good. Recently, I found in London a collection he made of important pamphlets about public affairs from the years 1641 to 1717. Some volumes are missing, as shown by the numbering, but there are still eight big books and twenty-four smaller ones.

The collection ended up with a second-hand bookseller who knew me because he had sold me some books before. He brought it to me. It seems my uncle left it behind when he moved to America about fifty years ago. I found notes he had written in the margins. His grandson, Samuel, is now living in Boston.
