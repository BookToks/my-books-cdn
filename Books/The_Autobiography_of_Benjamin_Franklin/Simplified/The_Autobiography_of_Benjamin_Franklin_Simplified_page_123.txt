Bradford needed someone to make money bills, which required special types and engravings that only I could provide. He was worried that by hiring me, he might lose the job. So, he sent me a polite message saying that old friends shouldn’t fight over a few angry words and invited me to come back.

Meredith convinced me to accept the invitation because it would give him more chances to learn the job from me. I agreed, and we got along better than before.

He got the job to make money for New Jersey, and to do it, I built a copper-plate printing press—the first one in the country. I also made different designs and pictures for the bills. We went to Burlington together, where I finished the work everyone liked, and he got paid, which helped him stay afloat for a while.

While in Burlington, I met new people.
