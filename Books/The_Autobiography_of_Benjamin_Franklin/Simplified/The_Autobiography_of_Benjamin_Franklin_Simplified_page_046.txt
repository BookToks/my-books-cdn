Even though I felt upset because of how my brother treated me, he wasnâ€™t usually a bad-tempered person. Maybe I had been a bit rude, which gave him a reason to act that way.

When he found out I wanted to leave, he tried to stop me from getting a job anywhere else. He went to all the printing shops in town and told the bosses not to hire me, so they all said no.

Then I thought about going to New York, the closest city with a printing office. After thinking more, I decided to leave Boston. I had already become suspicious to the leaders there. Because of how the Assembly treated my brother unfairly, I figured I would face more problems if I stayed. Also, since I had argued about religion, the religious people started to dislike me even more.
