After the meeting ended, someone kindly woke me up. This was the first house I went into and slept in when I arrived in Philadelphia.

I started walking again along the street by the river. I looked carefully at everyone I met until I noticed a young Quaker whose face I liked. I asked him where a stranger could find a place to stay. We were near the sign of the Three Mariners. He said travelers stay there, but it wasn’t a very good place. If I wanted, he would show me a better one.

He took me to the Crooked Billet on Water Street. I ordered some food for lunch. While I ate, people asked me a lot of strange questions because they thought I might have run away from somewhere since I looked young.

After lunch, I felt sleepy again. I lay down on a bed without taking off my clothes and slept until six o’clock in the evening. Then I was called to supper. Later, I went to bed.
