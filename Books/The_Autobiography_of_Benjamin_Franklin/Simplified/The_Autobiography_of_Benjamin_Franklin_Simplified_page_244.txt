In my big old ledger called E, I leave money to the people who support the Pennsylvania hospital. I hope that those who owe money, or their families if they have passed away, will pay or forgive these old debts as a kind gift to this great hospital. I know some money might not be collected, but I hope we can get a good amount back.

It’s also possible that some people I owe money to have unpaid bills from me. If that’s true, the hospital managers will figure it out and either subtract what I owe or pay the difference.

I ask my friends Henry Hill, John Jay, Francis Hopkinson, and Edward Duffield from Philadelphia county to be the people who handle my will. I officially choose them for this job.

I want my body to be buried simply, without a lot of cost or fancy ceremonies.

Philadelphia, July 17, 1788.
