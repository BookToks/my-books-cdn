My dad had a small, cheap library with about forty or fifty books. Most of them were about practical and religious topics. I read most of these books. Later, I wished I had found better books when I was really eager to learn, especially since it was already decided I wouldn’t be trained for the church.

Among my dad’s books, there was also Plutarch’s Lives, which I read a lot. I still think spending time on those books was very useful. I also found a book by De Foe called an Essay on Projects, and reading it probably influenced some important things that happened in my life.

Because I liked books so much, my dad finally decided I should become a printer, even though he already had a son working as a printer. My brother had come back from England in 1717 with a printing press and letters to start a printing business in Boston.

I liked this job much more than my dad’s work, even though I still had some doubts.
