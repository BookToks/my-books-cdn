I was working at Palmer's on the second edition of Woolaston's Religion of Nature.

Some of his ideas didn't seem right to me, so I wrote a small philosophy essay where I pointed out those problems. It was called "Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain." I dedicated it to my friend Ralph and printed a few copies.

After that, Palmer treated me with more respect and saw me as a talented young man. But he also strongly criticized the ideas in my essay, calling them terrible. Printing that work was another mistake I made.

While I was living in Little Britain, I got to know a bookseller named Wilcox, whose shop was next to mine. Back then, there were no libraries where you could borrow books. He had a huge collection of all kinds of books. We agreed that, for a fair price (which I canâ€™t remember now), I could use his library freely and take any books I wanted, as long as I returned them after reading.
