FRANKLIN.

I didn’t like either of their ideas, but I agreed to try them if he promised not to eat any meat. “I’m not sure my body can handle that,” he said. I told him he would actually feel better. He loved eating a lot, and I wanted to have some fun by making him try starving himself. He agreed to try this if I did it with him, and we actually kept it up for three months.

A woman nearby made and brought us our food. I gave her a list of forty dishes that didn’t have any meat or fish. I liked this idea because it saved money; we each spent only eighteen pence a week on food.

Since then, I have followed this kind of diet very strictly a few times, and I have also gone back to eating my usual food suddenly without any problems. This made me think that the common advice to change your diet slowly isn’t really important.
