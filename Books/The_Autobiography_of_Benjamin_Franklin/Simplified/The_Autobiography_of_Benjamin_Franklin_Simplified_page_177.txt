Franklin learned about a discovery of two kinds of electricity caused by rubbing glass and sulphur. This was first noticed by M. du Faye, but people ignored it for many years. Scientists thought the effects happened because of different amounts of electricity, and even Du Faye seemed to believe this later on.

At first, Franklin thought the same. But after trying the experiments again, he saw that Mr. Kinnersley was right. The electricity from glass and sulphur were actually positive and negative types, which Franklin had seen before. The glass made the prime conductor have more electricity (positive), while the sulphur took some away (negative). 

These experiments opened up a new area for study, and scientists got really interested. Their work helped us learn a lot more about electricity.

In September 1752, Franklin began...
