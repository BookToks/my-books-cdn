When I arrived in New England, I started working in a new job because my old one, dyeing cloth, didn’t pay enough to support my family. I was put to work cutting candle wicks, filling molds, managing the shop, and running errands.

I didn’t like this work and really wanted to be a sailor, but my dad didn’t allow it. Still, living near the water gave me lots of chances to go on and in the water. I learned how to swim and handle a boat. When I went out with other kids, they often let me steer the boat, especially when it was tricky. I was usually the leader in our adventures, even though sometimes I got us into trouble.

Here’s an example that shows how I liked organizing group plans early on, even if this one wasn’t exactly fair. There was a marsh by the edge of the millpond where we liked to stand when the water was high.
