The bag was locked, and I couldn’t open it right away, but the captain promised that before we reached England, I would get a chance to take the letters out. I was okay with that, so we kept going on our trip.

Everyone in the cabin was friendly, and we had plenty of food because Mr. Hamilton had brought a lot with him. During the trip, I became good friends with Mr. Denham, and our friendship lasted until he died. But the trip wasn’t very fun because we had a lot of bad weather.

When we got to the river, the captain kept his promise and let me look in the bag for the Governor’s letters.

I didn’t find any letters with my name on them, but I picked out six or seven that looked like they were meant for me. One was for Mr. Basket, the King's printer, and another was for a stationer, who was the first person I went to see. I gave him the letter from Governor Keith, but he said, “I don’t know you.”
