We already knew, just like the stationer, that attorney Eiddlesden was dishonest. He almost ruined Miss Readâ€™s dad by making him responsible for his debts. 

From a letter, we found out he was secretly working with the Governor to hurt Mr. Hamilton, who was supposed to be in Europe by then. Denham, a friend of Hamilton, thought he should know about this. So, when Hamilton arrived in England soon after, I went to see him and gave him the letter. 

He was very thankful because the information was important to him. From that moment, he became my friend, and this friendship helped me many times later.

But what should we think of a Governor who could do such a nasty thing and trick a poor, inexperienced young guy like that? It was a common practice with him.
