FRANKLIN.

I learned all the moves and positions from Thevenot and added some of my own ideas, trying to make them both graceful and useful. I enjoyed showing them off this time and felt really proud when people admired them.

Wygate wanted to get better at this skill, and we also liked the same things and studies, so he got along well with me. He finally asked me to travel around Europe with him while working in our jobs to support ourselves. I was about to say yes when I told my friend, Mr. Denham, about it.

I liked spending time with Denham whenever I had free time. He talked me out of going and told me to think about going back to Philadelphia since he was planning to go too. I should mention something good about him here.

He used to have a business in Bristol but failed. He made a deal with the people he owed money to and left for America, where he worked hard as a merchant.
