Franklin was like a country lawyer who quickly became an important person in the village. He helped with many public projects in both the county and the town of Northampton. People in Eaton told us many interesting stories about him.

He was respected by Lord Halifax and died on January 6, 1702, exactly four years before I was born. Some old people in the village told us about his life and character, and you thought it was amazing how much it reminded you of me. You said, "If he had died just four years later, it would seem like his soul moved into me."

John, as far as I know, learned to be a wool-dyer. Benjamin trained in London to be a silk-dyer. He was a hardworking man. I remember him well because when I was a child, he came to Boston and lived with my family for a few years.

My father and Benjamin were always close, and I was his godson. Benjamin lived to be very old. He left LIFE OF DR.
