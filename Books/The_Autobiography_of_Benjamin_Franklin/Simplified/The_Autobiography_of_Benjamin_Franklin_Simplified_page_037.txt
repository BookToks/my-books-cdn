While trying to improve my writing style, I came across an English Grammar book, which I think was Greenwood's. At the end, it had two short essays about rhetoric and logic. In the logic essay, I found an example of how to argue like Socrates did.

Soon after, I got a book by Xenophon called Memorable Things of Socrates. It showed many examples of the same way of arguing. I really liked this style and got excited about it. So, I started using it too. Instead of just saying "no" or arguing strongly, I acted like a humble questioner.

Reading Shaftsbury and Collins had made me doubtful about some ideas, and I was already unsure about many Christian teachings. Socrates' way of arguing felt safe for me and tricky for the people I talked to. I enjoyed it a lot, practiced it all the time, and got very good at making even smart people admit things they didnâ€™t want to.
