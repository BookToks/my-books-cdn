Dr. Franklin wrote a letter hoping it would reach Mr. Smith. He wanted to hear from him or see him on the ship Myrtilla, which was expected soon. He ended the letter by saying he cared for him a lot.

About a month later, Mr. Smith arrived in Philadelphia. He was quickly made the head of the school. This helped Dr. Franklin and the other leaders improve the school and open the college with a strong and generous foundation. They got a new official document for this on May 27th, 1755.

Up to this point, we showed Dr. Franklinâ€™s work in starting and building the school.

Soon after, he left for England to work for his country.
