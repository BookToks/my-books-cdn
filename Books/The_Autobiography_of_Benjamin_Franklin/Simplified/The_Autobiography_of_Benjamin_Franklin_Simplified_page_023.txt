Franklin was 19 years old. He was healthy, of average height, strong, and very active in everything he did. He could draw neatly and knew a little about music. His voice was loud and pleasant, so when he sang a psalm or hymn while playing his violin in the evening after work, it was really nice to listen to.

He also knew about mechanics and could use tools from different trades when needed. But his best quality was his good sense and smart judgment in making careful decisions, both in public and private life.

He didnâ€™t take part in public affairs because he was busy with his big family and his modest income, which kept him working hard in his job. Still, I remember that important people in town often asked for his advice about town or church matters, and they really respected his opinion. People also often came to him for personal advice.
