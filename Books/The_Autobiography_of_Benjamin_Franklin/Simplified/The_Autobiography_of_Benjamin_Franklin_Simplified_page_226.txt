FRANKLIN.

People were taught to believe in good and great things from a young age. So, what else could make them even think about separating if they hadn’t been treated unfairly again and again?

There were taxes on things like glass, paper, leather, paint, and tea. Some colonies even lost their right to vote. In other colonies, the king’s governors stopped the local governments from doing their jobs. When the colonists complained and asked for their problems to be fixed, they were ignored or treated badly. All these harsh actions made them want to fight back even more.

Instead of calming things down by being nicer, the government wanted to force the colonies to obey all their rules like slaves. But that only made things worse. No matter how much people tried to convince the government to stop and think about the problems it would cause, they refused to listen and kept pushing their plans with stubbornness almost never seen before.
