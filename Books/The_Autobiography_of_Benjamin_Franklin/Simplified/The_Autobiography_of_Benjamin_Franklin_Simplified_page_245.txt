I, Benjamin Franklin, wrote a will before, but now I want to add something to it. I have always believed that in a democracy, no one should have a job just to make money from it. When I became president, I planned to give my salary to public causes.

Before I wrote my last will in July, I had already given a lot of money to colleges, schools, and churches. In that will, I also left two thousand pounds to the state to help make the Schuylkill River easier to use for boats.

But now I realize that two thousand pounds won't be enough to fix the river, and the project might not happen for a long time. I have a new idea that I think will be more helpful.

So, I cancel the old plan to give money for the river. I want the money I’m still owed from my salary to be sold, and the money from that sale, two thousand pounds, to be used for the new plan I’m about to explain.
