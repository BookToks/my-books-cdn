Franklin and James Ralph were young men who loved reading. The first two worked as clerks for Mr. Charles Brockdon, a main lawyer in town, and the other clerk worked for a merchant. Watson was honest, religious, and smart. The others were less strict about religion, especially Ralph, whose beliefs, like Collins’s, had made me suffer quite a bit. Osborne was smart, honest, and a good friend, but he liked to criticize books too much. Ralph was honest and clever, dressed nicely, and was very good at speaking. I don’t remember meeting anyone who spoke as well as he did.

Both of them loved poetry and had already shown this by writing some small poems.

On Sundays, we liked to take a nice walk in the woods by the Schuylkill River. We would read together and then talk about what we read. Ralph wanted to focus completely on poetry. He believed in himself; LIFE OF DR.
