Franklin asked people who worked at night to watch carefully over the lives and property of the citizens. Everyone quickly saw this was a good idea, and changes were made.

Fires are very dangerous for growing cities. Other problems happen slowly, but fires can destroy everything in a moment. Because of this, all cities should have strong plans to stop fires from spreading. Franklin understood this early on, and around 1738, he started the first fire company in the city.

Other people copied this idea, and now there are many fire companies in the city. These groups help put out fires quickly, which is why the people of Philadelphia are known for being good at stopping fires. Because of them, the city has not been badly damaged by fires.

Later, Franklin suggested creating a group to help pay for losses when houses caught fire. This idea was accepted, and the group still exists today. It has helped people a lot.
