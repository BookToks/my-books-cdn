 There is nothing more dangerous to growing cities than fires. Other causes operate slowly, and almost imperceptibly but these ; in a moment render abortive the labors of ages. On this account there should be, in all cities, ample provisions to prevent fires from spreading. Franklin early saw the necessity of these; and, about theyear 1738, formed the first fire company in this city.
 
 This example was soon followed by others and there are now numerous fire companies in the city and liberties. To these may be attributed in a great degree the activity in extinguishing fires, for which the citizens of Philadelphia are distinguished, and the inconsiderable damage which this city has sustained from this cause. Some time after, Franklin suggested the plan ofan association for insuring houses from losses by fire, which was adopted ; and the association continues to this day. The advantages experienced from it have been great.
