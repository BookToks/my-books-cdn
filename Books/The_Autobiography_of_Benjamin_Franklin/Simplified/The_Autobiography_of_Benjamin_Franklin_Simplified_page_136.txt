People at a club of merchants were talking about a new printing business. Most of them thought it would fail because there were already about 70 printing shops in town, like Keimer's and Bradford's.

But Dr. Bard, who you and I met many years later in his hometown of St. Andrew's, Scotland, thought differently. He said, "Franklin works harder than anyone I've ever seen. I still see him working when I come back from the club at night, and he’s already working again in the morning before everyone else is awake."

This surprised the others at the club. Soon after, one of the members came to our house and offered to sell us stationery. But we didn’t want to start a shop just yet.

I don’t share this story to get praise, but so that my children and grandchildren who read these memoirs will understand the value of hard work by seeing what it did for me.
