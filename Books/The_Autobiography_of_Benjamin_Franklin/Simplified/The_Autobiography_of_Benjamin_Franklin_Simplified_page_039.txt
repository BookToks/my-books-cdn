People often make their ideas less useful by speaking in a way that sounds too sure of themselves. This kind of speech usually annoys listeners and makes them want to argue, which stops good communication.

If you want to share your opinion, being too forceful can make others disagree and not listen carefully. But if you really want to learn and hear what others think, and you show that you care about your own ideas without being pushy, thoughtful people who don’t like arguing will let you keep your mistakes quietly.

Using this approach, it’s hard to impress your listeners, win their trust, or convince them to agree with you. As Pope wisely said, people need to be taught gently, as if they didn’t know anything before, and new ideas should be shared as if they were old news.
