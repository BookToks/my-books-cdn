FRANKLIN.

I spent time with important people in the province. Many of them were chosen by the Assembly to watch over the printing press and make sure no extra bills were printed beyond what the law allowed. So, they often visited us one after another. When someone came, they usually brought a friend along.

I learned more from reading than Keimer did, and maybe that’s why people liked talking to me more. They invited me to their homes, introduced me to their friends, and treated me very kindly. Meanwhile, Keimer, even though he was in charge, felt a bit ignored.

He was a strange guy. He didn’t know much about everyday life, often argued rudely against popular opinions, was very religious in a way that annoyed people, didn’t keep himself clean, and was a bit dishonest.

We stayed there for almost three months. By then, I had made friends with Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill (the province’s secretary), Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several others.
