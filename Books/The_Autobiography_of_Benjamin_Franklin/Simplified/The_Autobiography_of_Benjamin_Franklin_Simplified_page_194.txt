I hope our owners will agree with us. I pray God helps them succeed.

My son sends his love and says, "Dear Sir, yours, etc.," B. FRANKLIN.

P.S. I haven’t gotten any letters from you since you arrived in England.  
Philadelphia, April 18, 1754.

Dear Sib,  
I have only received one letter from you since you got to England. It was a short one sent through Boston on October 18th. You told me you had written a lot by Captain Davis. But Davis was lost, and with him, your letters, which made me very sad.

Mesnard and Gibbon have arrived here, but I still haven’t heard from you. I comfort myself by thinking you haven’t written because you are coming soon and want to tell me everything in person.

Up on the request of Archbishop Hening and P. Collinson, Esq., and with help from letters by Mr. Allen and Mr. Peters, the Honorable Thomas Penn, Esq., agreed to give money every year and later gave at least 6,000 pounds to help start or improve the college connected to the academy.
