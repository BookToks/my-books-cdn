They killed small birds and set points on fire.

Their experiments made other scientists curious. Around 1745, Collinson sent a report about these experiments to the Library Company of Philadelphia, along with a tube and instructions on how to use it. Franklin and some of his friends quickly started doing their own experiments, and the results became well known.

He made many important discoveries and came up with ideas to explain different electrical phenomena. These ideas have been accepted everywhere and are likely to last a long time. He shared his observations in letters to his friend Collinson; the first letter is dated March 28, 1747. In these letters, he explained how points can pull in and push out electrical charge, something other scientists hadn’t noticed before. He also discovered the idea of positive and negative electricity.

We give him credit for this without any doubt, even though the English have said their own scientist, Dr. Watson, was the first. Watson’s paper is dated January 21, 1748, but Franklin’s came earlier.
