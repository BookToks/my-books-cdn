I continued the business on my own and made sure to tell everyone through ads that the partnership had ended.

This happened around the year 1729 or so.

At about the same time, people wanted new paper money because the only batch, which was fifteen thousand pounds, was about to run out. Rich people didnâ€™t like paper money because they were afraid it would lose value, like what happened in New England, which hurt people who used it. 

We talked about this in our group, called the Junto, and I supported making new paper money. I believed the first small amount made in 1723 helped a lot by boosting trade, work, and people moving here. 

Now, all the houses were lived in, and many more were being built. I remember when I first walked the streets of Philadelphia eating my roll, most houses on Walnut Street, Second Street, and Fourth Street were empty.
