My parents gave me some religious ideas when I was young, and I grew up learning about Calvinism. But when I turned fifteen, I started to question different beliefs because I read books that argued against them. Eventually, I began to doubt if revelation was true at all.  

I came across some books that were written to argue against deism. These books were based on sermons from Boyle's Lecture. But instead of convincing me, they had the opposite effect. The arguments from the deists, which were supposed to be proven wrong, seemed much stronger to me than the writers’ responses.  

In short, I soon became a full deist. My ideas also influenced some other young people, like Collins and Ralph. But later, when I remembered how badly they treated me without feeling sorry, and when I thought about how Keith, another free thinker, acted, as well as my own actions toward Vernon and Miss Read—which sometimes made me feel bad—I began to have doubts again.
