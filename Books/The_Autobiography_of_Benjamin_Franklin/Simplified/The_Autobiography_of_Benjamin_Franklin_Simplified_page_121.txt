I was ready to quit him right away. I grabbed my hat and left the house, asking Meredith to take care of some things I left behind and bring them to my place.

Meredith came to see me in the evening. We talked for a while about the fight that happened. He really respected me and felt bad that I left while he was still there. He tried to stop me from going back to my home country, which I was starting to think about.

He reminded me that Keimer owed me more money than he had. His creditors were starting to worry. His shop was in bad shape. He often sold things at cost just to get cash quickly and gave credit without keeping track. Soon, he would probably fail, which could open up a chance for me.

I said I didnâ€™t have enough money. Then Meredith told me that his dad thought very highly of me. After talking with him, Meredith was sure his dad would give us whatever money we needed to start a business if I wanted to become a partner.
