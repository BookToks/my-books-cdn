I can tell I'm getting old because I keep going off topic. But we don’t dress up the same way for a small party as we do for a big dance.

Maybe this shows I’m being careless.

Anyway, I kept working in my dad’s business for two years, until I was twelve. Around then, my brother John, who had finished his training in London, left my dad and started his own business in Rhode Island. It looked like I would take his place and be a candle maker my whole life.

But I didn’t like that job. My dad worried that if I didn’t find something I liked better, I might run away and go to sea, like my brother Josias had done, which made my dad very upset. So he took me to watch different workers like masons, coopers, braziers, and joiners, hoping I’d find a job I liked and stay on land. Later on, I realized...
