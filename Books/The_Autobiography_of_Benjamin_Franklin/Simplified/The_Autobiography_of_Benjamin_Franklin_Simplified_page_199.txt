A war happened between France and England.

The colonies were either too weak to defend themselves well or didn’t want to pay for building forts and keeping soldiers, while their neighbors who also benefited didn’t help with the costs. Sometimes, arguments between the governors and local governments stopped them from making plans for defense, like what happened in Pennsylvania in 1745. Because of this, coming up with a plan to unite the colonies and handle these problems seemed like a good idea.

To make this happen, in 1754, leaders from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland met in Albany. Dr. Franklin came as a representative from Pennsylvania and shared a plan called "The Albany Plan of Union" because of the meeting place. This plan suggested asking the British government to create a general government to rule the colonies.
