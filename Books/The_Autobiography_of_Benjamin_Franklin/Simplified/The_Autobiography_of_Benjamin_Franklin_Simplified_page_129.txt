FRANKLIN. I knew how important it was to have good principles and a honest character. I promised myself that I would always stick to them.

I hadnâ€™t been back from Burlington long when our printing materials arrived from London. I paid off what I owed Keimer and left him with his permission, before he knew about our plan.

We found a house for rent near the market.

We rented it, and to help with the rent (which was twenty-four pounds a year, but now I know it rents for seventy), we let Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, live there with his family. They paid us a good part of the rent, and we agreed to provide them food and board.

As soon as we unpacked our letters and set up the press, a friend named George House brought a countryman to us. This man was looking for a printer. We were almost out of money because we had to buy so many things. The five shillings we got from this man, our first money earned, made me happier than anything before.
