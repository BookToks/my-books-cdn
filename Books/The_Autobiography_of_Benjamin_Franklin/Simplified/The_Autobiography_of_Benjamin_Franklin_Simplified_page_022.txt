We went to the water to fish for small fish. By walking around a lot, we turned the place into a muddy mess. I suggested we build a small dock so we could stand on something solid. I showed my friends a big pile of stones that were meant for building a new house near the marsh, and these stones were perfect for our dock.

So, after the workers left in the evening, I gathered some of my friends, and we worked hard like ants. Sometimes four of us had to carry one stone together. We moved all the stones and built our little dock. The next morning, the workers were surprised when their stones were gone because we had taken them to build our dock.

People asked who took the stones, and when they found out it was us, there were complaints. Many of us got punished by our parents. I tried to explain that our work was useful, but my dad finally made me understand that nothing that isnâ€™t honest can really be helpful.

You might find it interesting to learn what kind of man my father was.
