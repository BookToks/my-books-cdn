Franklin was one of the most helpful and respected people in this state.

The school he started kept growing every day, making Dr. Franklin very happy. Even though he was very busy with many things in his life, he always went to the monthly school visits and check-ups. He worked hard, using his many letters to people far away, to make the school famous. He wanted students from all over America and the West Indies to come and learn there.

With the help of his kind and smart friend, Peter Collinson from London, the schoolâ€™s leaders asked for and got a special official paper on July 18, 1753. This paper, called a charter, was given by the important leaders of Pennsylvania, Thomas Penn and Richard Penn. Along with this, they gave a big gift of five hundred pounds.

Now, Dr. Franklin was excited and hopeful that his original plan would soon come true.
