In the same poem, he later tells us to speak carefully, even if we are sure.  

He could have also added another line he wrote somewhere else, but I don’t think it fits as well. It says, "For want of modesty is want of sense."  

If you wonder why I say it doesn’t fit well, I’ll show you the two lines together:  
"Immodest words admit of no defense,  
For want of decency is want of sense."  

Now, if someone lacks sense, isn’t that kind of an excuse for lacking modesty?  
Wouldn’t the lines be better if they said:  
"Immodest words admit of this defense,  
The want of decency is want of sense."  

But I’ll let smarter people decide that.  

In 1720 or 1721, my brother started printing a new newspaper.  
It was the second one to appear in America and was called the *New England Courant.*
