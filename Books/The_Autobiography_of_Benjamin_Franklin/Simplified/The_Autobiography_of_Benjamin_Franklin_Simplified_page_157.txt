Some people who loved studying had a hard time because there weren’t enough big libraries. So, starting a public library was a big deal. Benjamin Franklin began this idea around 1731. Fifty people each paid forty shillings and agreed to pay ten shillings every year.

More people joined, and in 1742, the group became official and called “The Library Company of Philadelphia.” Other groups in the city copied this idea. Later, all these groups joined together with the Library Company of Philadelphia. This made their collection of books and property much bigger.

Now, the library has about eight thousand books on many topics, some scientific tools, and a cool collection of natural and man-made objects. To support the library, the company owns valuable land. They also built a fancy building on Fifth Street, where they will put up a marble statue of Benjamin Franklin, their founder.
