Franklin thought these laws would hurt the owners, so he refused to agree to them. Because of this, the Assembly ended without passing a law about the militia. At that time, the province was in big trouble. It was being attacked by enemies and had no way to defend itself.

Franklin stepped up and suggested a plan to the people of Philadelphia. He wanted them to join a group to protect the province. The idea was liked, and 1,200 people signed up right away. Copies of this plan were sent all over the province, and soon 10,000 people signed.

Franklin was chosen to be the leader of the Philadelphia group, but he didnâ€™t think it was right to take the position.

After that, Franklin focused on different things for several years. He started doing experiments with electricity. He was very excited and curious, just like other scientists at that time.
