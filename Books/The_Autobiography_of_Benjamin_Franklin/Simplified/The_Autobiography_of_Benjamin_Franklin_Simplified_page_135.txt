Our business was doing well because everyone worked hard to get jobs for us. Breintnal, among others, got us a job from the Quakers to print forty sheets of their history. The rest was to be done by Keimer. We didn’t do the job perfectly because the price was very low. It was printed in folio size, on special paper, and used pica letters with heavy notes in very small type. I wrote one sheet a day, and Meredith put it on the press.

Often, it was eleven o’clock at night or even later before I finished planning the next day’s work. Small things our friends sent us sometimes slowed us down. But I was so determined to write one sheet a day that one night, when my work seemed finished, an accident broke my form and messed up two full pages. I immediately fixed and rewrote them before going to bed.

This hard work didn’t go unnoticed by our neighbors. It started to give us a good reputation and trust. I learned many things during this time.
