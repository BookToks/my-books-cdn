John Savage was an Irishman who didn’t have any special skill. Keimer had bought his service for four years from a ship captain. Savage was also going to work as a pressman.

George Webb was an Oxford student whose time Keimer also bought for four years. He planned to train Webb as a compositor. I will talk more about him soon.

Lastly, there was David Harry, a boy from the countryside who was apprenticed to Keimer.

I quickly realized that Keimer hired me at a higher pay than usual because he wanted me to train these new workers. They cost him very little since they were bound by contracts. Once they learned enough, Keimer hoped he wouldn’t need me anymore. Still, I stuck to my agreement. I organized the office, which was a total mess, and slowly got the workers to focus and do better work.

It was strange to see a smart Oxford student treated like a hired servant.
