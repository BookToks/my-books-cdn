Life can’t really happen without remembering things, and nothing is better for this than writing down memories. By doing this, I’m following the natural urge old people have to talk about themselves and what they’ve done. But I won’t be annoying because people can choose to read or not read what I write.

Honestly, I might be doing this partly to satisfy my own pride. Almost every time I hear someone say “I may say without vanity,” they end up showing some kind of pride right after. Most people don’t like pride in others, even if they have it themselves. As for me, I actually respect pride when I see it, because I believe it helps both the person who has it and the people around them.
