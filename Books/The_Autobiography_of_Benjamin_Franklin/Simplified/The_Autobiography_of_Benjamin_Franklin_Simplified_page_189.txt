I think the young students you teach can have fun and learn a lot here in math and philosophy. Mr. Alison, who studied at Glasgow, has been teaching philosophy for a long time, and Mr. Grew teaches math. Their students are making good progress.

Mr. Alison is in charge of the Latin and Greek school, but since he has three good helpers now, he can spend some time every day teaching those who are studying more advanced subjects. The math school has a good set of tools for learning.

The English library is good, and we also have some equipment for science experiments. We plan to get more soon.

The Loganian library, one of the best in America, will open soon. So, students will have plenty of books and tools to use.
