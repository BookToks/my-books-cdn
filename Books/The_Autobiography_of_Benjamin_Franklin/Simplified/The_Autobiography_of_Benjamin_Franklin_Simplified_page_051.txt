I went to bed with a really bad fever. I had read somewhere that drinking a lot of cold water could help in situations like this. I followed this advice, and I was sweating a lot during the night. The fever went away.

The next day, I took a ferry across the river and kept walking. I had fifty miles to go to reach Burlington, where I was told I could find boats to take me to Philadelphia. It rained hard all day, and I got soaked.

Around noon, I felt tired and stopped at a small, cheap inn. I stayed there for the rest of the day and all night. I started to wish I hadnâ€™t left my home. I looked so bad that people thought I might be a runaway servant, which I found out because of the questions they asked me. I felt like I could get caught any minute.

The next day, I kept going and got to an inn in the evening. It was about eight or ten miles from Burlington and was run by a man named Dr. Brown.

This man started talking with me.
