I was in grammar school, and even though it was a short time, I moved up from the middle of my class to the top. Then I moved to the next grade, and at the end of the year, I was supposed to move up again.

But my dad had a big family to support, and he realized he couldn’t afford to pay for college without having a hard time. He also told his friends that people with college education didn’t always get good jobs. So, he changed his mind, took me out of grammar school, and sent me to a school that taught writing and math. The teacher, Mr. George Brownwell, was really good and nice to his students. Because of him, I learned to write very well, but I didn’t do well in math and didn’t improve much.

When I was ten years old, I had to come home and help my dad with his work. He made soap and candles, but he never learned the trade as an apprentice.
