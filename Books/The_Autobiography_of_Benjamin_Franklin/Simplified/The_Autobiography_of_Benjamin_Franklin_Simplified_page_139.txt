The paper looked better than any other one in the province because of its type and printing. Some things I wrote about the fight between Governor Burnet and the Massachusetts Assembly caught peopleâ€™s attention. This made the paper and its editors become popular, and soon they started subscribing to our paper. Many others did the same, and our number of subscribers kept growing.

This was one of the first good results of my hard work learning to write down my ideas. I also got another benefit: important people in town saw that I was good at writing and decided to support and encourage me.

Bradford printed votes, laws, and other public papers. He had printed a message from the House of Assembly to the governor in a rough and messy way. We printed it again, but carefully and neatly, and sent a copy to every member. They noticed the difference, and this helped our friends gain more influence.
