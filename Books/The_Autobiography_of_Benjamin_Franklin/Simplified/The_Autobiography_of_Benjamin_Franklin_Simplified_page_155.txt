After about a year, because people didn’t take care of the books, everyone agreed to stop collecting them. Each person took back the books that belonged to them.

That’s when I first had the idea to start a public library where people could subscribe to use it.

I wrote up the plan and had it officially prepared by Brockden, the lawyer, and my project worked, as you will see later.

[Dr. Franklin’s life story, written by himself, stops here for now. We know he wrote more and hope the rest will be shared with the public someday. We believe readers will really enjoy his honest and thoughtful writing. So, to help with the disappointment, we decided to add the next part written by one of his close friends.]
