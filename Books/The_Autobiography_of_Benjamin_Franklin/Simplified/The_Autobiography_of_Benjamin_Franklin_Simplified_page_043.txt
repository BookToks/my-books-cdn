FRANKLIN. 39 I thought my brother should treat me the same way he treated anyone else. Actually, I felt he was often too strict, and since we were brothers, I believed he should be more understanding. We argued a lot, and my father usually had to decide who was right. Most of the time, either my brother was wrong or I was better at explaining my side, so my father usually agreed with me. But my brother could get angry and sometimes even hit me, which I really didn’t like.

This harsh and bossy behavior made me dislike people having too much power over others, a feeling I’ve had my whole life. My apprenticeship was really hard to deal with, and I kept hoping for a way to end it sooner. Finally, a chance came up when I didn’t expect it.

There was an article in our newspaper about politics that I don’t remember now, but it upset the Assembly. My brother got arrested, punished, and put in jail for a month because, I think, he wouldn’t say who wrote the article. 40 LIFE OF DR.
