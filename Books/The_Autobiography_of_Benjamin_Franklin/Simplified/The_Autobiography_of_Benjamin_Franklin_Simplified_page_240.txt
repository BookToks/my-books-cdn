Franklin quietly died after living a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months. It’s worth mentioning that in 1735, Dr. Franklin had a bad lung infection called pleurisy. This caused a painful abscess in the left part of his lungs, and he nearly suffocated because of the sudden discharge.  

He had a second similar attack a few years later but got better quickly and didn’t seem to have any trouble breathing after that.  

Before he died, he wrote an epitaph for himself. It said:  

“The body of Benjamin Franklin, Printer, (like the cover of an old book with its pages torn out and its letters and gold decoration gone) lies here as food for worms. But the work itself will not be lost, because it will, he believed, appear again in a new and better edition, fixed and improved by the Author.”
