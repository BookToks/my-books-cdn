Franklin was very well known. People who disagreed with him slowly stopped, and now the Franklin system is used everywhere where science is important.

Franklin’s big discovery helped protect houses from lightning damage. This was already mentioned. Pointed metal rods are now very common in America, but in Europe, people still don’t use them much because they don’t believe in them, even though there is clear proof they work.

People find it hard to stop old habits or start new ones. It’s actually surprising that such a smart idea, made about forty years ago, has been used in many places already. But it’s normal that not everyone uses it yet. Most people only change their ways slowly, even if the new way is better.

For example, it’s been almost eighty years since inoculation (a way to prevent disease) started in Europe and America. Even now, not everyone uses it, and it might take hundreds of years before it becomes common everywhere.
