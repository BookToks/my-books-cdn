They wanted to make rules about taxes and fees that would be fair and not too hard on the people. All new laws had to be sent to England for the king to approve. If the king didn’t say no within three years, the laws would stay in effect.

The president-general would pick all the army and navy officers, but the general council had to agree. For government workers, the council would choose them, and the president had to approve.

This was the basic plan Dr. Franklin suggested to the congress. After talking about it for a few days, everyone agreed. They sent copies to each local government and to the king’s council.

But the plan had a strange outcome. The British leaders didn’t like it because it gave too much power to the people’s representatives. On the other hand, the local governments didn’t like it because they thought the president-general, who represented the king, had too much power for a government meant for free people.

Maybe this rejection by both sides shows how hard it was to find a good balance.
