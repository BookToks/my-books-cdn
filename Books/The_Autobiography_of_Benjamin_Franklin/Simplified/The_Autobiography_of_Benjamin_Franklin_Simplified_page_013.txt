Life of Dr. Franklin continued his work until he retired to Banbury, in Oxfordshire, where his son John, who was a dyer, lived. My father became an apprentice with him. He died and was buried there. We saw his monument in 1758.

His oldest son lived in the family house at Eaton. He left the house and the land to his only daughter. She and her husband, Mr. Fisher of Wellingborough, later sold it to Mr. Estead, who owns it now.

My grandfather had four sons who lived: Thomas, John, Benjamin, and Josias. I will tell you what I remember about them because I don’t have my papers with me. If the papers are not lost while I’m away, they have more detailed information.

Thomas learned to be a blacksmith from his father. But he was smart and studied more because a man named Palmer, who was important in the village, asked him to. Palmer also encouraged my other uncles to learn and grow. Because of this, Thomas became good at his work.
