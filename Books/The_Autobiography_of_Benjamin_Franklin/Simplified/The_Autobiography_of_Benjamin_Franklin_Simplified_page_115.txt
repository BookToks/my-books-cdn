When I was in Franklin 111, I tried to get a job as a clerk for a merchant. But since I couldn’t find one quickly, I decided to accept Keimer’s offer.

In his printing house, I met a few people.

Hugh Meredith was from Pennsylvania and about thirty-five years old. He grew up working on a farm, was honest and smart, liked reading, but drank too much.

Stephen Potts was a young country boy who just left school. He wasn’t very educated but was a bit smarter and more cheerful than most. He was a little lazy. 

Keimer hired both of them for very low pay. He promised to raise their wages by a shilling a week every three months if they got better at printing. This promise was what made them agree.

Meredith was supposed to work the printing press, and Potts was to bind books. Keimer said he would teach them, even though he didn’t really know how either.
