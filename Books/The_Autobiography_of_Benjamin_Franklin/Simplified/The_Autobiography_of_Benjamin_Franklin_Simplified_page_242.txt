I give all my books, manuscripts, and papers to my grandson William Temple Franklin. I also give my share in the Library Company of Philadelphia to my grandson Benjamin Franklin Bache, trusting that he will let his brothers and sisters use it too.

I was born in Boston, New England, and I learned to read and write at the free grammar school there. Because of this, I give one hundred pounds sterling to my executors. They, or the last one left, will give this money to the managers of the free schools in Boston.

This money should be invested so it keeps earning interest forever. Each year, the interest will be used to buy silver medals. These medals will be given as awards by the school directors to encourage students to do well in their studies.
