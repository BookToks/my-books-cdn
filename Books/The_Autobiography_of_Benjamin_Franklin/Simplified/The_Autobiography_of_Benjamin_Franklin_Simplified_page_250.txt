If this plan is carried out and works as expected for one hundred years without stopping, the total amount will be one hundred and thirty-one thousand pounds.

I want the people in charge of the donation to the town of Boston to spend one hundred thousand pounds on public projects. These could be things that help everyone in the town, like forts, bridges, water systems, public buildings, baths, roads, or anything that makes living in the town easier and nicer for both the people who live there and visitors who come for health or short stays.

The remaining thirty-one thousand pounds should keep growing.
