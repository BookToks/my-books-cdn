I never thought for a second that his offer was honest. Up until then, I had kept the plan Sir William gave me—to start a business—a secret in Philadelphia, and I still kept it quiet. If anyone had known I trusted the governor, someone who knew him better might have told me not to trust him, because later I found out the governor was known for making promises he didn’t mean to keep. But since I never asked him for anything, how could I think his offers were fake? Actually, I thought he was the best person ever.

I gave him a list of a small printing shop, which I thought would cost about a hundred pounds.

He liked the idea but asked if it wouldn’t be better for me to come to England to pick the typefaces myself and make sure everything was good quality. He said, “You’ll also be able to meet people there and start working with book sellers and printers.” I agreed that was a good idea.
