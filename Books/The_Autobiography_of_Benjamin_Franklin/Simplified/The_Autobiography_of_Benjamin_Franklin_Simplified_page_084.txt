The eighteenth Psalm talks about God coming down to earth.

The time for our meeting was getting close when Ralph came to see me and said his work was ready. I told him I hadn’t done anything because I didn’t really want to do the task. He showed me his writing and asked what I thought about it.

I said I liked it a lot because it was really good. Then he said, "Osborne will never admit that anything I write is good. He’s jealous and always finds faults. But he’s not jealous of you. So, I want you to take my verses and say they are yours. I will pretend I didn’t have time to write anything. Then we’ll see how Osborne reacts." I agreed and copied the verses right away so no one would get suspicious.

We all met. Watson’s work was read first. It had some good parts but also many mistakes. Then we read Osborne’s, which was much better. Ralph did it just right.
