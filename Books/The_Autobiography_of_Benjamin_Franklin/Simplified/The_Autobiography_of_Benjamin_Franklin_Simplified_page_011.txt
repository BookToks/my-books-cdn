I found out that they had lived in the same village, Eaton in Northamptonshire, on a piece of land about thirty acres big, for at least three hundred years. My uncle couldn’t find out how long they lived there before that, but probably since people started using last names, when they took the name Franklin. This name used to mean a certain group of people.

This small piece of land wouldn’t have been enough for them to live on if they hadn’t added more to it. 

As proof that Franklin was once the name of a special group or rank in England, there is a book from 1412 that says good juries could be made anywhere in England. It explains that the area was full of landowners, like knights and heads of families, who were called franklins. They had enough land and money to make legal decisions.

Also, the country was so full of landowners that you couldn’t find a small village without a knight, an esquire, or a householder called a franklin living there.
