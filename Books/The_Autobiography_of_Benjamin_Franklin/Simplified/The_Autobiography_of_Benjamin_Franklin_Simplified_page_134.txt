And finally, William ColemiLH, who back then worked as a merchant's clerk and was about my age. He was calmer and clearer-headed, kinder, and had better morals than almost anyone I’ve ever met.

He later became a very respected merchant and even one of our local judges. We stayed friends without any breaks for over forty years, until he passed away. Our club also lasted almost as long.

This club was the best place to learn about politics and philosophy in the area at that time. We read questions once a week before talking about them, which made us carefully read books on those topics so we could join the conversation better.

Because of this, we got used to having nice discussions about any topic, following our rules, and making sure no one got annoyed. This is probably why the club lasted so long, and I’ll talk about it more later.

I’m telling you about this club because it was one of the important things I relied on.
