Within one year after I die, there should be a public announcement so that the people who can benefit from this plan know to apply. 

I also tell my executors, or the people in charge after I die, to pay two thousand pounds to the right people chosen by the leaders of Boston and Philadelphia. Each city will get one thousand pounds to use for the purposes I mentioned.

I know that over time, things can change and plans might not go as expected. I may have been too hopeful thinking everything would go smoothly and have the results I wanted. But I still hope that if the people in Boston and Philadelphia don’t want to manage this, they will at least accept this money. It’s a gift to show my good intentions, my thanks, and my wish to help.
