FRANKLIN.

I saved half of the money my brother gave me, which I used to buy books. This plan gave me other benefits too.

When my brother and his workers left the printing house to go to lunch, I stayed behind. I ate a simple meal, usually just a biscuit, some bread with raisins, or a bun with a glass of water. I used the rest of the time before they came back to study. Because I ate and drank lightly, my mind was clear and I learned faster.

Around this time, I felt embarrassed because I didn’t know how to do math well and had failed twice at school. So, I took a book called Cocker’s Treatise of Arithmetic and studied it easily on my own. I also read a book about navigation by Seller and Sturmy and learned the basic geometry it had, but I didn’t go much further in that subject. At almost the same time, I read Locke’s book on Human Understanding.
