A young woman who made and sold hats lived in the same house as us. She had a shop near the Exchange. She was lively and smart, and had learned more than most people in her position. Talking with her was very enjoyable. Every evening, Ralph read plays to her. They became close friends. She moved to a different place to live, and Ralph went to live with her.

They stayed together for a while, but Ralph didn’t have a job, she had a child, and her business didn’t make enough money to support all three of them. So, he decided to leave London and try working at a school in the countryside. He thought he would do well there because he had neat handwriting and knew a lot about math and keeping accounts.

But Ralph felt this kind of work was beneath him. He wanted to have a better life someday and didn’t want people to know he had done a job he thought was not honorable. So, he changed his name and even started using mine. Soon after he left, he wrote to me to let me know how things were going.
