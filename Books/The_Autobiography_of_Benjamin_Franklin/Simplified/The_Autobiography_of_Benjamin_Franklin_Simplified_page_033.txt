I noticed how clear and well-organized the writing was. He showed me this with several examples. I agreed with what he said, started paying more attention to language, and decided to try really hard to improve my writing style.

While thinking about this, I found an old book of the Spectator. I had never seen it before. I bought the book and read it over and over. I loved it, thought the writing was great, and wished I could write like that.

So, I picked some articles, made short summaries of each sentence’s meaning, and set them aside for a few days. Then, without looking at the book, I tried to rewrite the essays in full, using the best words I could think of. Afterward, I compared my writing with the original and found some mistakes, which I fixed. But I realized I didn’t know enough words and wasn’t good at remembering and using them, which I thought I would improve by practice.
