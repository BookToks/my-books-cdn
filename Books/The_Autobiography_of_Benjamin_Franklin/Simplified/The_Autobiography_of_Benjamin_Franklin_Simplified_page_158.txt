FRANKLIN.

Friends of literature in America and Great Britain helped a lot. The Penn family was well known for giving donations. One of the first supporters of this group was Peter Collinson, who was a good friend of Dr. Franklin.

Peter not only gave a lot himself but also got donations from his friends. He took charge of the company’s work in London, picking out books, buying them, and sending them over. Because he knew so much and cared about science, he did this job very well.

He helped for over thirty years and never asked for any pay. During that time, he shared all kinds of news about new ideas and discoveries in arts, farming, and science with the leaders.

This group quickly showed its value. The membership fee was low enough that anyone could join. It wasn’t just for rich people; even those with less money could take part and benefit.
