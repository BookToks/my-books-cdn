I was surprised to see the letters weren’t from the Governor. Thinking about everything, I started to doubt if he was honest. I went back to my friend Denham and told him everything. He immediately explained Keith’s character, saying there was no chance he wrote any letter and no one trusted him. He laughed at me for believing the Governor would give me a letter of credit when even he had none. 

Since I was worried about what to do next, Denham told me to try getting a job at a printer’s shop. "There," he said, "you can learn the trade and get ready to support yourself better." 88 LIFE OF DR.
