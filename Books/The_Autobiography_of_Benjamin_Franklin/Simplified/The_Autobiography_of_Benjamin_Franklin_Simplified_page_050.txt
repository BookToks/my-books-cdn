Some men stood on the shore and shouted to us, and we shouted back. But the wind was really strong, and the waves were so loud that we couldn’t hear each other. There were some canoes on the bank, and we called to them and made signs, hoping they would come and pick us up. But either they didn’t understand us or thought it was impossible, so they left.

Night came, and we had to wait quietly for the wind to calm down. Until then, the pilot and I decided to try to sleep if we could. We went below the hatches with the Dutchman, who was soaking wet. The sea waves crashed over the boat and got us wet too, so we were all soaked.

We hardly rested all night, but when the wind finally died down the next day, we managed to reach Amboy before dark. We had gone thirty hours without food and only had a bottle of bad rum to drink since the water around us was salty. In the evening, LIFE OF DR.
