FRANKLIN.

With just one simple comment, he made a long and fancy speech useless and decided an important question.

But he didn’t stop at just supporting the people’s rights. He wanted to make sure those rights were safe forever, and that could only happen if people understood their value. To do this, he believed everyone needed more information.

We already know he started the public library, which helped people learn and grow their minds. But that wasn’t enough. The schools back then were mostly not very good. The teachers weren’t well prepared for their important jobs, and students only learned the basics of English.

Franklin created a plan for a new school in Philadelphia, one that fit a young country’s needs. But like with all his ideas, he didn’t just think about the present. He also planned for the future, knowing that a bigger and better school would be needed later on.
