FRANKLIN.
 
 a single observation, he has rendered of no avail anelegantandlengthydiscourse, anddeterminedthe fate ofa question ofimportance.
 
 But he was not contented with thus supporting the rights ofthe people. He wished to render them permanently secure, which can only he donebymakingtheirvalue properly known ; and this must depend upon increasing and extending information to every class ofmen. We have already seen that he was the founder of the public library, which contributed greatly towards improving the minds of the citizens. But this was not sufficient. The schools then subsisting were in general of little utility. The teachers were men ill qualifiedfor the important duty which they had undertaken ; and,after all, nothing more could be obtained than the rudiments of a common English education. Franklin drew up a plan of an academy, to be erected in the city of Philadelphia, suited to "the state of an infant country;" but in this, as in all his plans, he confined not his views to the present time only. He looked forward to the period when an institution on an enlarged plan would become necessary. With LUE OF DR FRANKLIN.
