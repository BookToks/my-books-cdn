FRANKLIN.

Sometimes, it's not totally crazy for a person to feel proud of themselves and be thankful for that feeling as one of life's little pleasures.

I want to say, with all respect, that I owe my happiness so far to God's help. It's only because of that power that I have been able to do what I did and to succeed.

Because of my faith, I hope—even if I can't be sure—that God will keep helping me, either by letting me enjoy my happiness for a long time or by giving me strength to handle any hard times, like many others face.

No one knows what will happen to me in the future except God, who controls our fate and can even turn our troubles into something good.

One of my uncles, who also wanted to learn about our family history, gave me some notes. From these, I learned a lot about our ancestors. From LIFE OF DR.
