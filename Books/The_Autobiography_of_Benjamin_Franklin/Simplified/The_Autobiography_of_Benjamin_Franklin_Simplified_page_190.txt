We want to pay good salaries, so we believe we can always find great teachers. The success of the whole school really depends on them. Thank you for your kind offers to help with this. When you are settled in England, we might ask for your friendship and advice sometimes.

If it’s convenient for you to visit Philadelphia before going back to Europe, I would be very happy to see and talk with you here. I would also like to keep writing to you after you settle in England. Knowing and talking with smart, good, and caring people is one of my greatest pleasures.

I don’t know if you ever saw the first plans I made to start this academy. I am sending them to you now. Even though they were not perfect, they worked because people gave four thousand pounds to help make the school happen. We like advice and are learning every day, so I am hopeful.
