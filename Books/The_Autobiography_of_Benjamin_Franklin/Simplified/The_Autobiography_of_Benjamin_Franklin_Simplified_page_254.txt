I hope that even after Iâ€™m gone, they will both try to carry out my plan. I believe that even if unexpected problems come up, they can find ways to solve them and make the plan work.

If one of them agrees to take the money with the conditions, but the other says no, then my wish is that both amounts go to the people of the city who accept it. The money should be used for the same purposes and follow the same rules as if they had each taken their own part. If both say no, the money stays with the rest of my estate and will be handled according to my will made on July 17, 1788.

I give my nice crab-tree walking stick, with a gold handle shaped like the Cap of Liberty, to my friend and friend of all people, General Washington.

If it were a royal scepter, he deserves it and would wear it well.
