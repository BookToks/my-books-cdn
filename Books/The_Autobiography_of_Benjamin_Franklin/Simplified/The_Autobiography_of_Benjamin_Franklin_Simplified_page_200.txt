There was a system led by a president general, who was chosen by the crown. Alongside him was a grand council made up of members picked by representatives from different colonies. The number of members each colony had depended on how much money they gave to the general treasury. However, no colony could have more than seven or less than two representatives.

The president general had all the executive power. The grand council and the president general together had the power to make laws, but a bill could only become a law if the president agreed to it.

The president and council could declare war and peace and make agreements with Indian nations. They controlled trade with these nations and could buy land from them, either for the crown or the union. They could also settle new colonies, create laws to govern them until they became separate governments, raise troops, build forts, and prepare armed ships for defense. To do all this, they had the power to make laws needed for these actions.
