I used to work for them as their agent and got paid well for several years. Even though I accidentally lost more money than they paid me by sending Governor Hutchinson's letters, I still feel thankful. I believe that good apprentices often grow up to be good citizens.

I learned a skilled trade, printing, in my hometown. Later, two friends in Philadelphia kindly lent me money to start my business there. This helped me build my fortune and do useful things in life.

I want to keep helping others even after I die by supporting young men who can be helpful to their country in both Boston and Philadelphia.

So, I am giving two thousand pounds. One thousand will go to the people of Boston, Massachusetts, and the other thousand to the people of Philadelphia. This money is meant to be used for the purposes I will explain next.
