My brother stayed angry and in a bad mood, so I gave them a shilling to drink and said goodbye. This visit hurt my brother deeply. Later, when my mother asked him to make up and be friendly with us again, he said I had insulted him in front of his men and that he would never forget or forgive it. But he was wrong about that.

The governor’s letter surprised my father a little, but he didn’t say much.

After a few days, Captain Holmes came back. My father showed him the letter and asked if he knew Keith and what kind of person he was. He also said it didn’t make sense to start a business for a boy who wouldn’t be considered an adult for three more years. Holmes tried to support the idea, but my father still thought it was a bad plan and refused. He wrote a polite letter to Sir William, thanking him for offering to help me but saying no for now because he thought I was too young.
