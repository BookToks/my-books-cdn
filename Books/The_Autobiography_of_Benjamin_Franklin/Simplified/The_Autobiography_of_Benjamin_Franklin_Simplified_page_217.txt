Dr. 213 was an important person who always stood up for the people's rights.

In December 1762, something happened that scared a lot of people in the area.

Some Native Americans lived in Lancaster County and were always friendly to the white settlers. But after many attacks on the border, the settlers were very angry and wanted to get revenge on all Native Americans. About 120 people, mostly from Donegal and Paxton townships in York County, got together. They rode on horseback to the homes of these peaceful and defenseless Native Americans, who were now only about twenty in number.

The Native Americans heard about the attack but didn’t believe it. They thought the white people were their friends and didn’t expect any danger. When the group arrived, they found mostly women, children, and a few old men because the others were away working.
