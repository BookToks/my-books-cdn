Back in the early days of science, electricity was not studied much. People like Theophrastus and Pliny noticed that amber could attract small things, and later scientists learned from them. In 1600, an English doctor named Gilbert found many more materials that could attract light objects.

Other scientists like Boyle, Otto Guericke (who invented the air pump), Dr. Wall, and Sir Isaac Newton also made discoveries about electricity. Guericke was the first to notice that electricity could push things away and cause light and noise.

In 1709, a man named Hawesbec shared some important experiments about electricity. But after that, people stopped paying attention to electricity for a while until Mr. Grey started studying it seriously in 1728.

Mr. Grey and his friend Mr. Wheeler did lots of experiments. They showed that electricity could move from one object to another without touching. They also learned that electricity could travel long distances. Later, Mr. Grey found that if you hang iron rods with silk or hair strings and bring them close, interesting electrical effects happen.
