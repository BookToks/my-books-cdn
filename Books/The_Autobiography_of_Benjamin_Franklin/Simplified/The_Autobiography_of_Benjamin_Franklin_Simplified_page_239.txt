He had a bad cough and was having a hard time breathing.  

During this time, when his pain got really bad and made him groan, he said he was scared. He knew he wasn’t handling it as well as he should. Still, he felt thankful for all the good things he had in life. He believed that a higher power had helped him go from a simple start to a respected place among people. He thought his sickness was meant to help him let go of this world because he wasn’t meant to stay in it anymore.  

He stayed like this until five days before he died. Then, his pain and trouble breathing suddenly stopped. His family started to hope he would get better. But then, an infection in his lungs burst and a lot of pus came out when he coughed. He kept coughing it up as long as he could.  

After he got weaker, his breathing became harder and harder. He became very calm and sleepy. On the night of April 17, 1790, around eleven o’clock, he passed away.
