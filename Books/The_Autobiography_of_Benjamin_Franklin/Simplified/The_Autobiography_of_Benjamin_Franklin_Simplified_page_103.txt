Some people didnâ€™t pay their score, so they asked me to promise to pay it for them. Since they called it their "lighty," I went to the pay-table every Saturday night to pay the small amount I was responsible for, which sometimes was almost thirty shillings a week.

Because of this, people thought I was pretty good at talking, or in other words, good at joking around, which made me feel more important in the chapel. Also, my boss liked me because I worked hard and never took a day off without good reason.

I was really fast at writing, so I always got the jobs that needed to be done quickly, and those jobs usually paid the best. This made my time go by in a really nice way.

My old place in Little Britain was too far from the printing house, so I found a new place on Duke Street, right across from the Roman Catholic chapel. It was behind an Italian store. The house was run by a widow who had a daughter, a servant, and a shop.
