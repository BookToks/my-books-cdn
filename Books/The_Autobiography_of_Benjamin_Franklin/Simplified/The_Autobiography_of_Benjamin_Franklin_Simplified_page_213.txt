The British wanted to be friends with the French because they got a lot of weapons and ammo from them. Whenever there was a war, the Native Americans often attacked the border areas, even when Great Britain and France were not fighting each other.

Because of this, it made sense for Great Britain to take control of Canada. But people in England didnâ€™t really understand how important this was.

Around this time, Franklin wrote a pamphlet about Canada. In it, he clearly explained the benefits of taking over this province.

A plan was made to attack Canada, and General Wolfe was put in charge. Everyone knows how successful he was. In 1762, during a treaty, France gave Canada to Great Britain. At the same time, France also gave up Louisiana and all other land on the American continent.

Even though Dr. Franklin was mostly busy with politics, he still made time to study science and philosophy.
