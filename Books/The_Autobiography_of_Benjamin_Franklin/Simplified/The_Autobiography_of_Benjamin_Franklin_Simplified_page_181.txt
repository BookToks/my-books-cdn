Franklin always cared about people's rights from when he was very young. He soon became known as a strong opponent of the unfair plans made by the proprietaries. People looked up to him as the leader of the opposition.

Many of the sharp replies from the Assembly to the governors' messages are said to be his work. He had a lot of influence in the group. This wasn’t because he was a great speaker—he actually spoke rarely.

When he did talk, he never gave long speeches. His words were usually just one sentence or a short story with a clear point. He didn’t try to sound fancy or use big words.

His way of speaking was simple and calm. Like his writing, his style was plain, clear, and to the point. Because of this straightforward style and his smart thinking, he could easily defeat even the best speakers against him.

He also helped his friends feel sure about their ideas and convinced others who weren’t sure to agree with him.
