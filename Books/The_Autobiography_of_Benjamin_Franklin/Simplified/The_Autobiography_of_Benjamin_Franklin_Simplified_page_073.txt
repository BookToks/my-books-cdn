Collins wanted to get a job as a merchant's clerk, but either his breath or his face showed his bad habit. Even though he had good recommendations, he couldn’t find a job. So, he kept living and eating at my place, and I paid for everything.

He knew I had money, so he kept asking me to lend him some. He promised to pay me back as soon as he got a job. Finally, he borrowed so much that I got really worried about what would happen if he didn’t pay me back. His drinking didn’t get any better, and it often caused fights between us. When he drank too much, he became very stubborn.

One day, we were in a boat on the Delaware River with some other young people. Collins refused to row his turn. He said, "You will row for me until we get home." I said, "No, we won’t row for you." He answered, "You must, or we’ll stay on the water all night."
