Franklin and his son, along with Mr. Denham, a Quaker, and Messrs. Oniam and Kussel, who owned a forge in Maryland, had agreed to rent the whole cabin. So, Ralph and I had to stay with the crew.

Since no one on the ship knew us, they thought we were just regular people. But Mr. Hamilton and his son James (who later became governor) left us at Newcastle and went back to Philadelphia. He was called back at great cost to help with a ship that had been taken.

Just as we were about to leave, Colonel French came on board and was very polite to me. The other passengers started paying more attention to me too. Ralph and I were invited to take the cabin spot left open by the Hamiltons, and we happily said yes.

I found out that Colonel French had brought the Governorâ€™s important letters on board. So, I asked the captain for the letters I was supposed to take care of.

He told me that all the letters were kept together.
