He kept working on his electrical experiments and tried many tests, especially with the tourmaline stone. This stone is special because it can become positively charged on one side and negatively charged on the other just by heat, without rubbing it.

Dr. Cullen had done some experiments about cold caused by evaporation. Professor Simpson from Glasgow told Dr. Franklin about these experiments. Franklin tried them too and found that evaporating ether in an air pump on a hot day made so much cold that water turned into ice.

He used this discovery to explain some things, like why the human bodyâ€™s temperature never goes above 96 degrees Fahrenheit when healthy, even if the air around is much hotter. He said this happens because the body sweats more, and the sweat evaporating cools it down.
