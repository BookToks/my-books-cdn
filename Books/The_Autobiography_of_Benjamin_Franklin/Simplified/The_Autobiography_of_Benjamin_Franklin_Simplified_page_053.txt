FRANKLIN. 49 I asked her for advice. She invited me to stay with her until I could find a chance to leave. Tired from walking so far, I said yes. 

When she found out I was a printer, she wanted me to stay in Burlington and start my business. But she didn’t know how much money I would need for that! While I stayed at her house, she treated me very kindly. She gave me a dinner of beefsteaks and only asked for a pint of ale in return.

I thought I would stay there until Tuesday of the next week. But one evening, while walking by the river, I saw a boat with several people coming closer.

The boat was going to Philadelphia, and they let me come with them. Since there was no wind, we had to row to move. Around midnight, we couldn’t see the town. Some people thought we must have passed it and didn’t want to row anymore. Others didn’t know where we were, so we decided to stop.

We moved closer to the shore and went into a creek.
