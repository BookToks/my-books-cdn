The Governor seemed to like spending time with me and often invited me to his house. He always said he planned to help me start a business, which he had already decided. He told me I would get letters of recommendation for his friends and a letter of credit to get the money I needed to buy my press, types, and paper.

He set different days for me to come and get these letters, saying they would be ready. But when I came, he always told me to come back another day.

These delays kept happening until the ship, which had been delayed many times, was about to leave. I went to Sir Williamâ€™s house one more time to get my letters and say goodbye. I met his secretary, Dr. Bard, who said the Governor was very busy writing. He told me the Governor would be at Newcastle before the ship left, and that I would get the letters there.
