Franklin wanted to create a perfect school, like the colleges and universities in Europe. His academy was meant to be the starting place for this bigger school.

This is important to know because it shows who Dr. Franklin really was—as a thinker and as someone who supported learning and science. Even though he said clearly in the rules that the academy was started to teach Latin and Greek, along with useful arts and sciences for a young country, some people have recently said that Franklin thought learning dead languages like Latin and Greek was a waste. They also said he didn’t want a bigger college to grow from his academy and that this made him unhappy.

But if you look closely, the opposite is actually true.
