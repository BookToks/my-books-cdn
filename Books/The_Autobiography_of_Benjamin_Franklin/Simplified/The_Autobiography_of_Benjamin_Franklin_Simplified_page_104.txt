US, JPRANKLIN, boj; but the second person slept outside the house.

After asking the people where I stayed in Little Britain about my character, she agreed to let me stay for the same price, three and sixpence a week. She was okay with charging so little because, since they were all women, having a man living there made her feel safer.

She was an older woman, the daughter of a clergyman. She was raised Protestant, but her husband, whom she respected a lot, had made her become Catholic. She knew many important people and had stories about them going back to the time of Charles II.

She often had gout attacks that kept her in her room, but she sometimes liked to have visitors. I enjoyed her company so much that I was happy to spend evenings with her whenever she wanted. Our supper was simpleâ€”half an anchovy each on bread and butter, with half a pint of ale to share. But the best part was her interesting conversation.
