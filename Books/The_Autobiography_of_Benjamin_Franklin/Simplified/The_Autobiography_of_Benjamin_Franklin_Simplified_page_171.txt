When a thunderstorm started coming, Franklin went outside to the open fields with his son. He only told his son what he planned to do because he knew people often made fun of science experiments that didn’t work.

He stood under some shade to stay dry from the rain and flew his kite. A thundercloud passed overhead, but at first, nothing happened. He almost gave up hope.

Then, suddenly, he saw the string’s loose fibers stand up straight. He touched the key with his knuckle and got a strong spark.

Imagine how amazing he must have felt! This experiment was really important for his theory. If it worked, he would be famous for helping science. If it failed, people would either laugh at him or feel sorry for him, thinking he was just a silly dreamer.

You can understand how nervous he was waiting to see what would happen. He was starting to doubt himself, but then the spark proved his idea was right.
