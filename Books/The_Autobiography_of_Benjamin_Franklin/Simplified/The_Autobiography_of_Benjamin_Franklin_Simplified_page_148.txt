Koimer was losing money every day. In the end, he had to sell his business to pay off his debts. He then moved to Barbadoes, where he lived in poor conditions for a while.

His apprentice, David Harry, who I had taught when I worked with Koimer, bought his materials and took over the business. At first, I was worried that Harry would be a strong competitor because he came from a rich and respected family. So, I asked him to be my partner, but he refused proudly.

Harry thought he was very important and spent a lot of money. He liked to have fun and was hardly ever at home. Because of this, he got into debt, ignored his business, and his business suffered.

Soon, Harry had nothing to do in the country, so he went to Barbadoes like Koimer, bringing his printing tools with him. There, the apprentice made his old master work for him. They often argued, and Harry kept getting into debt. Eventually, he had to sell his press and type and go back to his old job.
