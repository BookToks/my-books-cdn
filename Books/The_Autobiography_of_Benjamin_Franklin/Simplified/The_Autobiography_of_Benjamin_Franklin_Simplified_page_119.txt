Franklin had very little money. But he was kind enough not to ask me for any.

Our printing press often didn’t have enough letters to use. There was no one in America who made letters like that. I had seen how it was done in London at James’s house, but I didn’t pay much attention then. Still, I figured out how to make a mold. I used the letters we had to make punches, then made new lead letters with clay molds. This helped us get the letters we really needed.

Sometimes, I also carved decorations, made ink, and took care of the shop. Basically, I did all kinds of jobs. Even though I was helpful, I noticed my work was becoming less important as the other men got better at their jobs. When Keimer paid me my second quarter’s wages, he said they were too high and I should accept less. He slowly started being less nice to me.
