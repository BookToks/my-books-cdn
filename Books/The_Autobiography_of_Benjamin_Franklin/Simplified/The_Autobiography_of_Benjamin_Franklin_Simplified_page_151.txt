FRANKLIN. 147

They said they didn’t have that much money. I told them they could get it by borrowing against their house. 

After a few days, they said they didn’t like the idea of me marrying their daughter. They talked to Bradford and learned that being a printer didn’t make much money. They said my letters would get worn out and I’d need new ones. They also said that Keimer and Harry had failed, and I probably would too. So, they told me not to come to their house, and the young lady was kept inside.

I don’t know if they really changed their minds or if they were just pretending, thinking we were too in love to stop and would get married secretly. That way, they could choose whether or not to give their permission. But I thought this was their plan, so I never went back to their house.

Later, Mrs. Godfrey told me they now liked me and wanted me to visit again. But I said I would never have anything to do with the family again. The Godfreys were upset about that.
