A sum of one thousand pounds will be given to the people living in Boston if they agree to accept it. This money will be managed by the town leaders together with the ministers from the oldest Episcopal, Congregational, and Presbyterian churches in Boston.

They will lend the money at 5% interest each year to young married workers under 25 years old. These workers must have completed an apprenticeship in Boston and have shown good behavior.

To borrow the money, the workers need to get a good character reference from at least two respected citizens who will also promise to help pay back the loan if needed. The loans will be recorded in Spanish milled dollars or the same value in gold coins.

The managers will keep a special book with the names of everyone who asks for and gets the loan, their guarantors, the amount lent, the dates, and other important details about the loan.
