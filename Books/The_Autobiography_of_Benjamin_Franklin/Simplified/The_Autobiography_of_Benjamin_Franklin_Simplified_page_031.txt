I will tell you how I learned the little skill I have, given my situation.

There was another young man in town named John Collins who loved books as much as I did. We were close and often argued with each other. We liked having debates so much that it felt like a fun battle of words.

But this habit of always arguing can be bad. It can make people not want to be around you because you just disagree with everything. It causes fights and can even ruin friendships that are really important. I picked up this habit from reading religious argument books when I lived with my dad. I’ve noticed that smart people usually don’t do this, except for lawyers, university folks, and people educated in Edinburgh.

One day, Collins and I got into an argument...
