From the very beginning of Pennsylvania, people argued a lot. While William Penn was alive, the rules of the state were changed three times. After he died, most of Pennsylvania’s history was about fights between the owners of the land or their governors and the Assembly.

The owners wanted their land to be free from taxes, but the Assembly didn’t agree. This fight came up in almost every discussion and stopped important laws from being made. Because of this, people sometimes had big problems.

In 1744, during a war between France and Great Britain, some French and Native Americans attacked the people living near the edges of the province. These people were not ready to defend themselves. So, the citizens needed to get weapons to protect themselves.

Governor Thomas asked the Assembly to make a law for a militia, a group of armed citizens. The Assembly said they would only agree if the governor agreed to some other laws first.
