Franklin had great success with the device he made at his own house. Other scientists in Europe soon tried the experiment too. One of the best was Father Beccaria from Turin, who helped science a lot with his observations. Even in cold Russia, people were excited to discover more. Professor Richman was about to learn a lot about this, but sadly, he died when lightning hit his conductor. Science lovers still remember him sadly as someone who died for electricity.

These experiments proved Franklin's idea was true in a very clear way. When no one could doubt it anymore, some people got jealous and tried to downplay his work. It was hard for them to accept that an American from a small, unknown city called Philadelphia could make discoveries and ideas that even smart European scientists missed. They thought he must have copied someone else.
