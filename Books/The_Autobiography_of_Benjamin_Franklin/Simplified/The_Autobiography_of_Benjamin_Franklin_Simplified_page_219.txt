Some people who believed fighting was always wrong were very active during this time. The rioters came to Germantown.

The governor ran to Dr. Franklin’s house for safety. Dr. Franklin and some others went out to meet the Paxton boys, as the rioters were called. They were able to convince them to stop and go back home.

The arguments between the landowners and the Assembly, which had calmed down for a while, started again. The landowners were unhappy with the rights given to the people and tried hard to get back the power to avoid paying taxes on their estates.

In 1763, the Assembly passed a law about the militia, but the governor didn’t agree to it unless some changes he suggested were made.

He wanted the fines to be higher, and sometimes wanted to replace fines with the death penalty.

He also wanted to choose all the officers himself, instead of letting the people pick them, like the bill said.
