Dr. Franklin had a very strong body and was not often sick. The only problem he had sometimes was gout. But around 1781, he started having symptoms of a painful disease related to kidney stones, which stayed with him for the rest of his life.

Even when he was in pain, he spent many happy times talking in a friendly and interesting way. His mind stayed sharp and clear right up until he died.

As president of the abolition society, he signed a petition to the U.S. House of Representatives on February 12, 1789. The petition asked them to use all their power to stop the slave trade.

This was the last public thing he did. When people talked about the petition, some tried to defend the slave trade. Then, in the Federal Gazette on March 25, there was an essay written by Dr. Franklin under the name Historicus. In it, he shared a speech that was said to have been given in Algiers in 1687, arguing against the slave trade.
