2814 LIFE OP DR. FRANKLIN.
 
 His constitution had been a remarkably good one. He had been little subject to disease, except an attack of the gout occasionally, until about the year 1781, when he was first attacked withsymptoms of the calculous complaint, which continued during his life.
 
 During the intervals of pain from this grievous disease, he spent many cheerful hours, conversinginthe mostagreeableandinstructive manner. His faculties were entirely unimpaired even to the hour ofhis death.
 
 His name, as president ofthe abolition society, was signed to the memorial presented tothe HouseofRepresentatives ofthe United States, on the 12thof February, 1789, praying them to exert the full extent of power vested in them by the constitution, in discouraging the traffic of the â€” human species.
 
 This was his last public act. Inthe debates to which his memorial gave rise, several attempts were made to justify the trade. In the Federal Gazette of March 25, there appeared an essay, signed Historicus, written by Dr. Franklin, in which he communicated a speech, said to have been delivered in the Divan ofAlgiers, in 1687, in oppositiontothe LIFE OF Dtt.
