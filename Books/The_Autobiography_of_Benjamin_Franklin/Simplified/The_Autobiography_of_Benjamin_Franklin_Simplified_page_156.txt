FRANKLIN.

This was taken from an American magazine and written by the late Dr. Stuber from Philadelphia.

In Pennsylvania, people didn’t pay much attention to literature. Most of them were too busy with work to think about science or learning.

Dr. Stuber was born in Philadelphia to German parents. He went to university when he was very young. Because he was smart, hardworking, and kind, his teachers liked him a lot. He finished his studies faster than most and left university when he was only sixteen, already well-known.

Soon after, he started studying medicine. He worked really hard and learned a lot, making his friends think he would become a very successful doctor. But since he didn’t have much money, he didn’t think being a doctor was the best choice for him.

So, after earning his medical degree and becoming qualified, he stopped studying medicine and began studying law instead. Sadly, he died young before he could use his talents and enjoy the success he worked so hard for in literature and law.
