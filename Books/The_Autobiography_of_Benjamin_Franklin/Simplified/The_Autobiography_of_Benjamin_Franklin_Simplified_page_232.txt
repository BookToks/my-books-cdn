FRANKLIN.

He was highly respected by all the smart and educated people, and this respect spread to everyone else too. Because of this, he had a lot of personal influence.

He also published several important works that helped build a good reputation for the United States. Because of his efforts, the U.S. was able to get loans from Holland and France, which helped end the war successfully.

The British kept losing battles, especially when Cornwallis and his army were captured. This made the British realize they couldn’t control the Americans. People involved in trade especially wanted peace.

The British government couldn’t ignore this anymore. They agreed to peace terms, which were signed in Paris on November 30, 1782, by Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, Mr. Jay, and Mr. Laurens for the United States, and by Mr. Oswald for Great Britain.
