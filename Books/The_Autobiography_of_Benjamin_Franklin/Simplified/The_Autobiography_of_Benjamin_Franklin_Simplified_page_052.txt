While I took a break to eat, he saw that I was reading a little and showed me a lot of interest and friendship. We stayed friends for the rest of his life. I think he was a traveling doctor because he knew a lot about almost every town in England and even Europe.

He was smart and well-read, but he didn’t believe in religion. A few years later, he made a funny and disrespectful version of the Bible in silly poetry, like how Cotton made fun of Virgil’s work. He showed many things in a funny way that might have upset sensitive people, but he never published it.

I stayed at his house overnight and got to Burlington the next morning. When I arrived, I was upset to find out that the usual boats had already left. It was Saturday, and the next boat wouldn’t come until Tuesday. So, I went back to the house of an old woman in town who had sold me some gingerbread for the trip.
