I was born into a poor and unknown family, where I spent my early years. But I worked hard and made my way to a life of wealth and some fame in the world. Good luck has helped me through every part of my life up to my old age. My descendants might want to know how I did it, and maybe they can learn from my story if they ever face similar challenges.

When I think about the happiness I’ve had, I sometimes tell myself that if I could live my life again, I would choose to do it the same way. The only thing I would want is the chance to fix some mistakes, like an author fixing errors in a second edition of a book. I would also like to change a few small events to better ones if I could.

But even if I couldn’t do these things, I would still accept the chance to live my life over again.
