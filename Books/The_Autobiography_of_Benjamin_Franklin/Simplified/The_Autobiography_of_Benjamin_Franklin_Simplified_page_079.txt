We argued a lot together. I was so used to my Socratic way of asking questions that I often confused him. My questions seemed unrelated at first, but they slowly led to the main point. This made him get stuck in tricky situations and contradictions he couldn’t get out of. After a while, he became super careful and hardly answered even simple questions without first asking me, "What do you mean by that?" Because of this, he thought I was really good at proving people wrong. He even seriously asked me to join him in starting a new religious group. He would preach the ideas, and I would argue against anyone who disagreed.

When he told me about his beliefs, I found many ridiculous ideas that I didn’t want to accept unless he agreed with some of my opinions too. Keimer kept his beard long because Moses once said, "Don’t mess up the edges of your beard." He also kept the Sabbath, and for him, these two things were very important.
