Animals hadn't done anything, and couldn't do anything, to hurt anyone that would make it okay to treat them badly. I thought this way of thinking was really strong.

Before, I really liked fish. When a cod was taken out of the frying pan, I thought it tasted great. I felt torn between what I believed and what I wanted. Then I remembered that when the cod was opened, there were small fish inside its belly. I thought, if fish eat each other, why can't we eat them?

So, I happily ate the cod and kept eating like other people do. Sometimes I went back to eating only plants. It’s funny how smart people can always find a good excuse to do what they want.

I stayed on good terms with Keimer, who didn’t know about my plans. He was still excited about things and liked to argue, so we often talked.
