Around 1752, a well-known doctor named Dr. Bond noticed how badly poor people suffered when they got sick. He had the idea to start a hospital to help them.

Even though he tried hard, not many people wanted to donate money for his idea. He didn’t want to give up, so he asked Franklin for help.

Franklin agreed right away. He used his connections and wrote about how useful the hospital would be in his newspaper. Because of this, more people gave money, but they still didn’t have enough.

So Franklin went to the government and asked for help. After some arguments, they agreed to pass a law saying that if people raised two thousand pounds, the government would give the same amount to help build the hospital.
