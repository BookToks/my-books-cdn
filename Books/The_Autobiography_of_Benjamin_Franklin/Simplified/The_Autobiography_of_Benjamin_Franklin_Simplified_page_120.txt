FRANKLIN took on more of a bossy attitude. He often found fault, was hard to please, and seemed like he was about to argue with me all the time. I kept putting up with it, thinking his bad mood was partly because his business was messed up and he was stressed.

One day, a small event ended our connection. I heard a noise outside and looked out the window to see what was happening. Keimer was in the street and saw me. He shouted at me to mind my work and said some mean things, which upset me even more because he said them loudly where the neighbors could hear.

He then came into the printing room and kept yelling at me.

We started arguing heatedly, and he told me I had to leave in three months, just like we had agreed before. He said he was sorry he had to give me such a long notice. I told him he didnâ€™t need to be sorry because I was ready to go.
