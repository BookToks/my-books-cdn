The president general was chosen by the king, so he had to support the king’s opinions. Because of this, he would not agree to any laws, even good ones, if they might hurt the king’s interests. Even if he agreed, the king still had to approve the laws, and the king would always choose what was best for his own land, not the colonies.

This caused constant arguments between the council and the president general, and also between the American people and the British king. While the colonies were weak, they had to obey. But when they got stronger, they would ask for more rights until, finally, they would break free and become independent.

When the French controlled Canada, they traded a lot with the native people, even beyond the British settlements. Sometimes, they tried to build trading posts inside the territory.
