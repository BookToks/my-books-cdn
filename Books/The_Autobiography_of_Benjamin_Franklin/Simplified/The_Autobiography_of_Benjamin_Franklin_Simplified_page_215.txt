In a letter to Mr. Small from London in May 1760, Dr. Franklin shared some thoughts about storms in North America. He noticed that northeast storms actually start in the southwest parts. For example, one big storm began in Philadelphia about four hours before it reached Boston.

He tried to explain this by thinking that heat near the Gulf of Mexico makes the air lighter. Cooler air from the north then rushes in to take its place, followed by even cooler and heavier air from farther north. This creates a steady flow of air.

People had already known that rubbing a wet finger around the edge of a drinking glass makes a sound. Mr. Puckeridge, who was Irish, put several glasses of different sizes on a table and filled them with different amounts of water. He tried to make a musical instrument that could play songs this way.

Unfortunately, he died too soon and couldnâ€™t finish improving his invention. After he died, some others worked on making it better.
