Keimer knew a little about the printing business but was just a typesetter and couldn't work the press. He had once been part of a group called the French prophets and knew how to act like they were having supernatural experiences. When I first met him, he didn’t follow any particular religion but pretended to believe a little of everything when it suited him.
