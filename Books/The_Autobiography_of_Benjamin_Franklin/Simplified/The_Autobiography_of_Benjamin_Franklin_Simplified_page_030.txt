Franklin.

A man in the printing house noticed me. He invited me to see his library and kindly let me borrow any books I wanted to read.

I then became interested in poetry and wrote a few small poems. My brother thought it might be useful, so he encouraged me and asked me to write two ballads. One, called the Lighthouse Tragedy, told the story of Captain Worthilake and his two daughters' shipwreck. The other was a sailor’s song about capturing the famous pirate Teach, also called Blackbeard. The poems were really bad in style, kind of like blind people’s songs. When they were printed, my brother sent me around town to sell them. The first one became very popular because the event had just happened and was well known.

I felt proud of this success, but my father stopped me from getting too full of myself. He made fun of my poems and said that poets were always poor. Because of this, I avoided the trouble of being a very bad poet.

But learning to write prose helped me a lot in my life and was a big part of my success.
