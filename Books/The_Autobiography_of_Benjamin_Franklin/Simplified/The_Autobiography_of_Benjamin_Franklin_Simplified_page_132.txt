FRANKLIN.

We had a club where we talked about different topics, and every three months, each person had to write and read an essay about anything they wanted. Our discussions were led by a president, and everyone was supposed to be honest and open to the truth. Arguing just to win or be right was not allowed. To keep things calm, we weren’t allowed to say things that showed stubbornness or directly disagree with others. If someone did, they had to pay a small fine.

The first members of our club included Joseph Breintnal, who worked as a scrivener. He was a middle-aged man, kind and loyal to his friends. He loved poetry, read everything he could, wrote pretty well, was creative with small projects, and was fun to talk to.

Thomas Godfrey was another member. He was a skilled mathematician who taught himself. Later, he invented what is now called Hadley’s dial, but at the time, he didn’t have much use for it.
