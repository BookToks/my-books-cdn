She gave a small part of her money to the poor, lived on watery gruel, and only used fire to boil her water. She had lived in this small attic room for many years without paying rent to the Catholic people who owned the house. They actually thought having her there was a good thing.  

A priest came every day to hear her confession. My landlady said, "I asked her how, living like this, she needed so many visits from a confessor?" She replied that it was impossible to avoid having useless or distracting thoughts.  

I was once allowed to visit her. She was happy, polite, and easy to talk to. Her room was clean, but she only had a mattress, a table with a crucifix and a book on it, a chair she offered me to sit on, and above the fireplace a picture of St. Veronica showing her handkerchief with the face of Christ on it. She explained the picture to me very seriously.  

Her face was pale, but she had never been sick. I can mention her as another example from the life of Dr. Franklin.
