There was a discussion about whether women should be taught science and if they could understand it. Collins said no, that it was too hard for them. I thought the opposite, maybe just to argue for fun. Collins was better at talking and used many words, so I often felt like I was losing, not because his ideas were stronger, but because he talked more.

We didn’t agree and had to stop talking since we wouldn’t see each other for a while. So, I wrote down my thoughts clearly and sent them to him. He replied, and I answered back. We wrote three or four letters each.

Then my dad found my papers and read them. He didn’t say who was right or wrong but used the chance to talk to me about how I wrote. He said that even though I spelled and punctuated better because of my work, I was not as good as Collins in some other way.
