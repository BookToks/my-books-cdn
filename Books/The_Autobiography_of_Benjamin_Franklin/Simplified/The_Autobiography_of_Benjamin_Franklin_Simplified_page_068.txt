I was trusted with an important job that needed a lot of money.

My old friend Collins, who worked as a clerk at the post office, loved hearing about my new home and wanted to visit. While I waited for my dad’s decision, he left for Rhode Island by land before me. He left his books, which were a great collection about math and science, to be sent with mine to New York, where he planned to wait for me.

My dad didn’t agree with Sir William’s plan, but he was happy I got such a good recommendation from someone important. He was also proud that I worked hard and saved money to get ready so well in such a short time. Since there was no chance my brother and I would get along, my dad agreed I could go back to Philadelphia. He told me to be polite to everyone, try to earn respect, and avoid being sarcastic or mean, because he thought I did that too much. He also said that with hard work...
