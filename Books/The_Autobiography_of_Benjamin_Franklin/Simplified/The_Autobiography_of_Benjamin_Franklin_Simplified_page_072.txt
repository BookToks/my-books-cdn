Franklin was sadly addicted to brandy. I found out from him and others that since he got to New York, he had been drunk every day and acted very wildly.

He also lost all his money playing games, so I had to pay for his hotel and support him for the rest of his trip. This was a big problem for me.

The Governor of New York, named Bernet, heard the captain say that a young man on the ship had a lot of books. He asked the captain to bring me to his house. I went, and I would have taken Collins with me if he hadn’t been drunk. The governor was very kind, showed me his big collection of books, and we talked about books and authors for a while. This was the second governor who had been nice to me, and for a poor kid like me, these little experiences were very exciting.

We got to Philadelphia. On the way, I received Vernon’s money, which was very important for me.
