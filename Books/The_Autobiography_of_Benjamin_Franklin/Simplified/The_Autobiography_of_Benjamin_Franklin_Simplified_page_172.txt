FRANKLIN.

It was proven so clearly that even the most doubtful people had to believe it. Sparks were taken from the key many times, a bottle was charged, a shock was given, and all the usual electricity experiments were done.

About a month before this, a smart Frenchman finished the discovery in the way Dr. Franklin first suggested. He sent letters to Mr. Collinson, but they were said to be rejected from the Royal Society of London’s publications. Still, Collinson published them separately in a book called "New Experiments and Observations on Electricity made at Philadelphia, in America." People read it eagerly, and soon it was translated into different languages.

A very bad French translation ended up with the famous Buffon, who, even with the poor translation, liked it a lot and tried the experiments himself successfully.

He convinced his friend, M. D'Alibard, to make a better French translation of the American electrician’s work for their country.
