My dad wanted me to work with my brother because he was worried about me going to sea. I didnâ€™t want to at first, but after some time, I agreed and signed a contract to be an apprentice when I was only twelve years old. The deal was that I would work as an apprentice until I was twenty-one, and I would only get paid like a full worker in my last year.

I learned a lot quickly and became very helpful to my brother. I also got a chance to get better books. Because I met other apprentices who worked for booksellers, I could borrow books from them. I always made sure to return the books on time and without any damage. Many times, I stayed up most of the night reading a book I borrowed in the evening because I had to give it back the next morning.

Eventually, Mr. Mathew Adams, a clever tradesman who had a nice collection of books and often visited our print shop, became important in my story.
