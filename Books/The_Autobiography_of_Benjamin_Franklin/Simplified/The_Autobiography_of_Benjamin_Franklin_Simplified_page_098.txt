Franklin was stuck in a small village in Berkshire. In his letter, he recommended Mrs. T., the hat maker, to me and asked for a reply sent to Mr. Franklin, schoolmaster at N**.

He kept writing to me often, sending big parts of an epic poem he was working on. He wanted me to check and fix it. I did, but I also tried to convince him to stop writing it. Young had just published one of his Satires. I copied a lot of it and sent it to Franklin, where the author shows how silly it is to chase fame through poetry. But it didn’t help. Paper after paper of his poem kept coming in the mail.

Meanwhile, Mrs. T*** lost both her friends and her business because of him and was often in trouble. She asked me for help, so I lent her all the money I could. I liked her a bit too much. Since I didn’t follow any religion back then, and because she needed help, I tried to take advantage of her, which was another mistake.
