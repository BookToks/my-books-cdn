FRANKLIN.

In the Assembly, I found out that we were chosen to be its printer for the next year.

I shouldn’t forget one friend, Mr. Hamilton, who I mentioned before. He had just come back from England. He really helped me a lot this time and many other times later. He stayed kind to me until he died.

Around this time, Mr. Vernon reminded me that I owed him money, but he didn’t push me to pay right away. I wrote him a nice letter asking him to wait a little longer. He agreed, and when I could, I paid him back with interest and thanked him a lot. This made up for a big mistake I had made.

But then another problem came up that I didn’t expect. Meredith’s father was supposed to pay for all our printing supplies, but he had only paid one hundred pounds. He still owed another hundred, and the merchant was getting tired of waiting.
