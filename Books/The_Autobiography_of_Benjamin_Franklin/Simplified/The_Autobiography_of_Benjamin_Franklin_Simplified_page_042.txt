FRANKLIN.

I wrote a piece without saying who I was and slipped it under the door of the printing house at night. The next morning, it was found. My brother showed it to his friends when they came to see him. They read it out loud and talked about it where I could hear. I was really happy because they liked it. They guessed who wrote it, but no one thought it was me. Instead, they thought it was someone famous and talented.

I felt lucky they liked it and started to think they werenâ€™t as good as I thought. After this, I wrote more pieces the same way and sent them to be printed. They were liked too. I kept it a secret until I ran out of ideas and information to write about. Then I told them it was me.

When my brother found out, he respected me a little more. But he still saw himself as my teacher and treated me like I was learning from him. He thought he was in charge.
