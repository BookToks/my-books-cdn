FRANKLIN was sad about his daughter because she was almost always feeling down and liked to be alone. He thought his forgetting and changing feelings while he was in London were the main reasons she was unhappy. But her mother blamed herself instead of him, since she had stopped their marriage before he left and then got her to marry someone else while he was away.

Their love came back, but there were big problems with them being together. People said her marriage wasnâ€™t real because the man she married already had a wife living in England. It was hard to prove this from far away. Some said the first husband was dead, but no one was sure. Even if he was dead, he left many debts that the new husband might have to pay.

Still, despite all these problems, they took a chance. Franklin married her on September 1, 1730. None of the bad things they worried about actually happened. She was happy.
