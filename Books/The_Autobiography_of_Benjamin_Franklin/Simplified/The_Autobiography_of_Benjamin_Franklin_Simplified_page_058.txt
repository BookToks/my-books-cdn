I woke up very early the next morning. 

As soon as I got up, I tried to make myself look presentable and went to Andrew Bradford’s printing shop. I saw his father there, someone I had met before in New York. He had traveled on horseback and got to Philadelphia before me.

He introduced me to his son, who was polite and gave me some breakfast. But he said he didn’t need another worker right now because he just hired someone. He told me there was another printer named Keimer who might want to hire me. He also said if Keimer didn’t, I could stay at his house and he would give me small jobs until I found something better.

The old man said he would take me to meet the new printer. When we got there, he said, “Neighbor, I brought a young man who knows printing; maybe you need his help.” Keimer asked me some questions and gave me a tool to see how well I could use it.
