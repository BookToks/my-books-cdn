There were some problems with what was happening, so it was decided that from now on, the paper should be printed under Benjamin Franklin’s name. To avoid trouble from the Assembly, who might accuse him of still printing the paper himself but using his apprentice’s name, it was agreed that my old contract would be given back to me. It would have a full release written on the back, so I could show it if needed.

But to make sure my brother still got the benefits of my work, I was supposed to sign a new secret contract that would last for the rest of the term. This was not a very smart plan. Still, it was done quickly, and the paper kept coming out with my name on it for several months.

Later, my brother and I had another disagreement, and I decided to use my freedom, thinking he wouldn’t dare show the new contract. I know this was wrong and not honorable, and I see it as one of the first mistakes I made in life. But back then, I didn’t really understand how serious it was.
