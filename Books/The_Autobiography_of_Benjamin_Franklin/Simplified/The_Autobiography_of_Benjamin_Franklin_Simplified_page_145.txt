There were many empty houses on Chestnut and other streets, with signs saying they were for rent. This made me think that people were leaving the town one after another.

Our debates helped me understand the topic so well that I wrote and published an anonymous pamphlet called "An Inquiry into the Nature and Necessity of Paper Currency." Many ordinary people liked it, but rich people didn’t, because it made more people support the new paper money. Since they didn’t have a good writer to argue against me, their complaints became less strong. The House of Assembly mostly agreed with the idea, so it passed.

The friends I made in the House thought I had done something important for the country. To thank me, they gave me the job of printing the bills.

This job paid well and helped me at a good time. It was another benefit of getting used to writing.
