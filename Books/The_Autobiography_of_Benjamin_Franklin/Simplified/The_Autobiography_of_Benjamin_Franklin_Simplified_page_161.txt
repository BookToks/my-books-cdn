Franklin was chosen to represent the city of Philadelphia after many years of working with different groups.

Bradford had some advantages over Franklin because he was the postmaster. This helped him spread his newspaper more widely and get more ads. Later, Franklin got the same advantage when he became the postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737. While Bradford was postmaster, he was unfair to Franklin and tried to stop his newspaper from spreading. When Franklin had the chance to get back at Bradford, he chose not to because he was a good person.

In Philadelphia, the police had watchmen whose job was to protect people from robbers at night and to quickly warn everyone if there was a fire. This job is very important. But the rules they had were not strict enough. Franklin saw the problems this caused and suggested changes to make the watchmen take their job more seriously.
