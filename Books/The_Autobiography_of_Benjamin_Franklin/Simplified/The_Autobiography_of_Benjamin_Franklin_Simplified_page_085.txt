Franklin looked at the work, pointing out a few small mistakes but also praising the parts that were really good. He didn’t have anything to show himself. 

Now it was my turn. I tried to say no at first, acting like I didn’t have time to fix anything. But they wouldn’t accept any excuses, and I had to share my work. It was read carefully again and again. Watson and Osborne quickly admitted I did the best job and said they liked it a lot. Only Ralph said a few things and suggested some changes, but I stood by what I wrote. Osborne agreed with me and told Ralph he wasn’t any better at criticizing than he was at writing.

Later, when Osborne was alone with me, he said even more strongly that he liked my work.

He said he had held back before because he was afraid I’d think he was just trying to flatter me.

“But who would have thought,” he said, “that Franklin could write like this? It’s full of vivid pictures, energy, and passion! He did better than the original. In normal talks, you wouldn’t guess he could write something so powerful.”
