Some groups of regular soldiers and local fighters were sent to take back the places the French had taken over. When everyone was ready, a problem came up that almost stopped the mission. The problem was they didn’t have enough wagons.

Franklin stepped in and, with help from his son, quickly found one hundred and fifty wagons. Sadly, Braddock walked into a surprise attack and died along with many of his men. Washington, who was helping him and had warned him about the danger, showed great skill in leading the army’s remains to retreat and join up with the troops at the back, led by Colonel Dunbar. Dunbar now took charge.

They managed, with some trouble, to get their small group to safety, but they had to destroy their wagons and supplies so the enemy wouldn’t get them. Franklin had promised to pay a lot of money for the wagons he had provided. The owners said they planned to make him pay back for their wagons.
