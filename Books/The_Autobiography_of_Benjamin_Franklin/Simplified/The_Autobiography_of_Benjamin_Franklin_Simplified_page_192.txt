188 LIEE or DR. FRANKLIN.

You changed the language, but since advice from friends can help more than praise, I should tell you that I wish you hadn’t included the quote from the review,* which you’re now rightly unhappy about. Also, I think you should have left out the angry words about your opponents on pages 65 and 79. Sometimes, the best way to win is to ignore them and keep going.

Mr. Allen has been out of town for ten days, but before he left, he asked me to get him six copies of your work. Mr. Peters took ten copies. He wanted to write to you, but didn’t because he expects to see you here soon.

He asks me to send you his warm greetings and says you will be very welcome. I just want to say that I’ll do everything I can to make your visit to Philadelphia enjoyable.

I am, etc., Mr. Smith.  
B. FRANKLIN.

*The quote mentioned is from the London Monthly; THE LIFE OF DR.
