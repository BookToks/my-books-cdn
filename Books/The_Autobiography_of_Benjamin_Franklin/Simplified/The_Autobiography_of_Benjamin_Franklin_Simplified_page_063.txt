Holmes was with the governor when he got my letter. He talked about me and showed it to him. The governor read it and looked surprised when he found out how old I was. He said he thought I was a young man with a lot of talent. He said I should be encouraged because the printers in Philadelphia were mostly not very skilled. He believed I would do well if I started my own business. He also said he would give me all the public work and help me in any way he could.

Later, my brother-in-law told me about this when I was in Boston, but I didn’t know anything about it at the time. One day, Keimer and I were working near the window when we saw the governor and another man, Colonel French from Newcastle, nicely dressed, cross the street and come straight to our house.

We heard them at the door, and Keimer thought the visit was for him, so he went down. But the governor asked for me, came upstairs, and was very polite and kind to me, which I wasn’t used to at all.
