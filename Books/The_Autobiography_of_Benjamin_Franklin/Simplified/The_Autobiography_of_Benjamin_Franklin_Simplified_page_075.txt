FRANKLIN. I was asked to find a tutor for a man’s children in Barbadoes. I met Collins and offered him the job. He accepted and promised to pay me back with the first money he got, but I never heard from him again.

Breaking Vernon’s trust was one of the biggest mistakes I made. It showed that my dad was right to think I was too young to handle important things. But Sir William, after reading the letter, thought Collins was just being careful.

He said that people are different: being older doesn’t always mean you’re wise, and being young doesn’t always mean you’re foolish.

“Since your dad won’t help you start a business,” he said, “I will.

Make a list of what you need from England, and I’ll send for it.

You can pay me back when you’re able. I want a good printer here, and I believe you’ll do well.” He said this so kindly that I felt encouraged.
