The colonies were facing a huge challenge because the British sent strong armies and fleets to make them obey.

The colonists had a big army, but they didn’t have much training or experience in war. They had no money, no navy, no friends to help, and only their love of freedom to keep them going. They wanted to break away from a country that had treated them badly many times. Dr. Franklin strongly supported this idea and helped convince others to agree with him.

People were already getting ready for this change because of Mr. Paine’s famous pamphlet, Common Sense. It’s believed that Dr. Franklin helped a lot by giving ideas for this work.

In 1776, a group met in Philadelphia to create a new government for Pennsylvania. Dr. Franklin was picked to be their leader. The new state constitution they made was the result of their work.
