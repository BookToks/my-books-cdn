Breintnal kept the paper going for several months. This made people notice Bradford's paper. Keimer’s paper, which we made fun of, was ignored by most people. Even though he had his own paper, after nine months and only about ninety subscribers, he decided to sell it to me for very little money. I was ready to take over, so I did, and after a few years, it made me a good profit.

I realize I often talk about this as if it was all me, even though we were partners. That’s probably because I ended up doing almost everything. Meredith wasn’t a good printer and often drank too much. My friends didn’t like that I worked with him, but I still managed to get as much out of it as I could.

Our first issue didn’t really make a big impact. A copy is kept in the Philadelphia library, and it’s said that Franklin wrote the first five issues and part of the eighth.
