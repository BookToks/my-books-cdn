If you rub a tube, sparks might jump out, and you can see a light at the ends in the dark. M. du Feye, who took care of the French King's gardens, did many experiments that helped science a lot. He found two types of electricity, which he called vitreous and resinous. The first came from rubbing glass, and the second from rubbing things like sulfur and sealing wax. But later, he realized this idea was wrong.

Between 1739 and 1742, Desauguliers did many experiments too, but didn’t discover much new. He was the first to use the words “conductors” and “electrics per se.” In 1742, some smart Germans worked on this topic. The main ones were Professor Boze from Wittemberg, Professor Winkler from Leipsic, Gordon, a Scottish monk and philosophy teacher at Erfurt, and Dr. Ludolf from Berlin.

Their research amazed European thinkers. They used big machines that could collect a lot of electric fluid. Because of this, they showed electric effects that nobody had seen before.
