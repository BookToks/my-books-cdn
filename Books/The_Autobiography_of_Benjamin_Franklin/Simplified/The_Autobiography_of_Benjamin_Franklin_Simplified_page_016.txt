Our family was simple and had accepted the Reformation early on. They stayed loyal even during Queen Mary’s rule, when they could have been in trouble because they were against popery.

They had an English Bible, and to keep it safe, they came up with a plan. They tied the Bible open with strings inside the lid of the chamber pot. When my great-grandfather wanted to read to his family, he put the lid on his knees and turned the pages carefully, held down by the strings. One of the kids stood by the door to watch for the proctor, who was an officer from the church court. If he showed up, they quickly put the lid back so the Bible was hidden again.

I heard this story from my uncle Benjamin.

The whole family stayed loyal to the Church of England until near the end of King Charles II’s reign. Then, some ministers who were kicked out for not conforming held secret meetings in Northamptonshire. Benjamin joined them.
