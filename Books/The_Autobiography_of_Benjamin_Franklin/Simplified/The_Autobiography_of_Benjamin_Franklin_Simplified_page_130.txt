I have earned some money since then, and remembering how thankful I felt to George House makes me want to help young people who are just starting out in business.

In every country, there are grumpy people who always expect bad things to happen. In Philadelphia, there was a man like that. He was rich but getting old, looked wise, and spoke very seriously. His name was Samuel Mickel.

I didnâ€™t know him, but one day he stopped by my house and asked if I was the young man who had just opened a new printing shop. When I said yes, he told me he felt sorry for me because it was a costly project and the money spent would be lost. He said Philadelphia was a city going downhill, and almost everyone there had to borrow money from creditors. 

He claimed to know for sure, from real facts, that the city was in trouble, even though there were new buildings and prices were going up.
