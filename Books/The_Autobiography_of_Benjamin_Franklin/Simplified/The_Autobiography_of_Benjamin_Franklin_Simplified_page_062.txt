I earned money by working hard and, because I was careful with my spending, I lived happily. I tried to forget Boston as much as I could and wanted everyone to not know where I lived except my friend Collins, who I wrote to and who kept my secret.

But something happened that made me go home much earlier than I planned.

I had a brother-in-law named Robert Holmes. He was the captain of a trading boat that went from Boston to Delaware. While he was in Newcastle, which is forty miles below Philadelphia, he heard about me. He wrote to tell me that my parents were very upset because I left Boston suddenly, but that they still loved me. He said if I came back, everything would be worked out to make me happy. He really wanted me to come back. I replied to his letter, thanked him for his advice, and clearly explained why I left Boston. He understood and saw that I wasnâ€™t as wrong as he first thought.

At that time, Sir William Keith, the governor of the province, was also in Newcastle.
