Franklin met many important people, including King Louis XV.

Some letters written by Hutchinson, Oliver, and others to powerful people in Great Britain were found by Dr. Franklin. These letters said harsh things about the leaders in Massachusetts and strongly urged the government to force the people to obey their rules. 

Dr. Franklin sent these letters to the Massachusetts legislature, who then made them public. Official copies were also sent to Great Britain with a request to the king to remove officials who were disliked by the people and did not support their interests.

The letters caused a fight between Mr. Whately and Mr. Temple, because both were suspected of helping to get the letters. To stop the argument, Dr. Franklin said in a newspaper that he had sent the letters to America but would not say where he got them from.
