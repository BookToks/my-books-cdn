Franklin’s will says that a certain amount of money should be lent out to earn interest for 100 years. He hopes this will help young people behave better and support many good and useful citizens. After these 100 years, the money will grow to over four million pounds. Out of this, one million will be managed by the people of Boston, and three million will be managed by the state government. Franklin doesn’t want to say more about how the money should be used.

He also says that the same rules for Boston should apply to Philadelphia. Since Philadelphia is officially a city, he asks its leaders to manage the money following the same instructions. He gives them full power to do this.

Franklin noticed that when cities cover the ground with buildings and streets, rainwater can’t soak into the earth. This can make the water in wells worse over time until it becomes unsafe to use, which has happened in many old cities. So, he suggests that after 100 years, if it hasn’t been done yet, Philadelphia’s leaders should use some of the money to bring fresh water to the city through pipes from Wissahickon Creek. He thinks this will be easy because the creek is higher than the city, and they could build a dam to raise the water level if needed.
