I hoped that by being careful with money, I could save enough by the time I was old enough to start my own business. If I needed a little extra money, my father said he would help me.

This was all he agreed to, except for some small gifts from him and my mother to show they cared. I set off again for New York, carrying their approval and good wishes.

Our boat stopped at Newport, Rhode Island, where I visited my brother John. He had lived there for a few years and was married. He had always liked me a lot and welcomed me warmly. One of his friends, Vernon, owed him about thirty-six pounds from Pennsylvania. Vernon asked me to collect the money for him and keep it safe until he contacted me. He gave me a note for this. This situation later caused me a lot of worry.

While at Newport, we picked up several passengers. Among them were two young women and a serious, wise Quaker lady.
