Franklin thought he could become really great at poetry and even make a lot of money from it. He said that the best poets made many mistakes when they first started writing, just like him. 

Osborne tried to stop him by saying he didn’t have a talent for poetry and told him to stick with the job he already knew. “In business,” he said, “if you work hard, even without money, you can still do well, maybe get a good job, and eventually start your own company.” 

I agreed with Osborne but also said it was good to have fun with poetry sometimes to get better at writing. Because of this, we decided that at our next meeting, each of us would bring some poems we wrote ourselves. 

The goal was to help each other by giving feedback and fixing mistakes. Since we just wanted to improve our writing style, we agreed to focus only on rewriting existing poems, not creating new ideas.
