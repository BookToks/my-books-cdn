Flunklin. 123 This idea, even if it might be true, wasn’t very helpful. I started to think less of my London pamphlet, which had a quote from Dryden at the beginning:

“Whatever is right; though blind man  
Sees but part of the chain, the nearest link,  
His eyes not carrying to the equal beam  
That poises all above.”

The pamphlet tried to show that from God’s qualities—his goodness, wisdom, and power—there couldn’t be any real evil in the world; that good and bad didn’t really exist and were just useless ideas.  

But now, I don’t think it was such a perfect work as I once believed. I realized that some mistake must have quietly slipped into my argument, messing up all the conclusions I made, which often happens with tricky philosophical thinking.  

In short, I finally understood that being honest and sincere in how people treat each other is super important for a happy life. From that moment on, I decided to live by that and wrote the 124 LIFE or DR.
