I decided in my journal to follow certain rules for the rest of my life.

I didn’t really believe in revelation itself, but I thought that even if some actions weren’t bad just because they were forbidden, or good just because they were allowed, it was likely that those actions were banned because they weren’t good for us, or allowed because they were helpful.

Because of this belief, and maybe some luck or protection from a guardian angel, I stayed away from bad behavior and serious unfairness, even though I didn’t have religion to guide me. This was especially important when I was young and in risky situations, like being far from my dad and around strangers.

I say “voluntary” because the mistakes I made were mostly due to being inexperienced or because other people were dishonest. Before I started my own new life, I had already learned some important lessons.
