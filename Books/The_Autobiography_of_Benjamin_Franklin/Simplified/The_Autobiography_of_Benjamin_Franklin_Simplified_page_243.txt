Franklin gave the town some land, and the town leaders can decide how to use it.

From the money I am owed as president of the state, I give two thousand pounds to my executors. They should pay this money to the person or people the state government chooses. This money will be used to make the Schuylkill River easier to travel on by boat.

When I worked as a stationer, printer, and postmaster, many small amounts of money were owed to me for things like printing, ads, and postage. These debts were never collected because in 1757, I was sent to England by the Assembly as their agent. I stayed there until 1775, then came back and worked with Congress. In 1776, I went to France for nine years and only returned in 1785. Since no one asked for the money for so long, these debts seem old, but they are still rightfully owed to me.
