Franklin did a bunch of experiments to find out what kind of electricity is in the clouds. From these tests, he figured out that clouds during a thunderstorm usually have negative electricity, but sometimes they have positive electricity. Because of this, he said that most of the time, lightning comes from the earth going up to the clouds, not the clouds striking down to the earth.

He wrote about these ideas in a letter dated September 1753. Even though he discovered this way before, some people think the idea of lightning going up was new and give credit to Abbe Bertholon, who wrote about it in 1776.

Franklin’s letters were translated into many European languages and Latin. As more people read them, his ideas became popular.

Some people didn’t agree with Franklin, especially Abbe Nollet. But Nollet didn’t have much support. The top scientists in Europe, like D’Alibard and Beccaria, defended Franklin’s ideas.
