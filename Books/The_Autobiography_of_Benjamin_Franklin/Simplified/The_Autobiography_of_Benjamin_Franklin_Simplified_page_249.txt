Franklin's will talks about a plan to help young married workers start their own businesses. The managers decide how much money each person can get, but no one can get more than sixty pounds or less than fifteen pounds.

If too many people apply and there isn't enough money to help everyone, the loans might be small at first. But as the money grows with interest, there will be more to lend out. To help more people and make paying back easier, each borrower has to pay the yearly interest plus one-tenth of the amount they borrowed. The money paid back will be loaned out again to new borrowers.

It is expected that good and kind people in Boston will volunteer their time to run this plan without getting paid. The money should never sit unused or be spent on other things. Instead, it should keep growing with interest. In the future, if there is more money than Boston needs, some of it can be shared with nearby towns in Massachusetts. Those towns must promise to pay the interest and part of the borrowed money back every year to the people of Boston.
