FRANKLIN. 109 refused to live with him or even use his last name because there was a rumor that he already had another wife. Miss Read’s parents liked his skills at work, but he was a bad person and a bad citizen. He got into debt and ran away to the West Indies around 1727 or 1728, where he died.

While I was away, Keimer moved into a bigger house where he ran a shop that had lots of paper and other things. He got some new printing type and hired workers, but none of them were very good. Still, he seemed to have enough business.

Mr. Denham rented a warehouse on Water Street to show and sell our goods.

I worked hard, learned about money and business, and soon became very good at it. We lived and ate together. He cared about me like I was his son, and I respected and loved him too. I was happy then, but that happiness didn’t last long.
