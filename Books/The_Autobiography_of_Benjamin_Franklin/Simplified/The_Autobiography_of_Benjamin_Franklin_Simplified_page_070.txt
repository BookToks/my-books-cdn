I had been nice to the Quaker woman’s servants by helping with little tasks. Because of this, she probably started to care about me. One day, she pulled me aside and said, "Young man, I’m worried about you. You don’t have parents to guide you, and you don’t seem to understand the dangers young people face. Trust me when I say this: those girls you’ve been hanging out with have bad reputations. I can tell by how they act. If you’re not careful, they could get you into trouble. They’re strangers to you, and because I care about you, I advise you not to get involved with them."

At first, I didn’t think they were that bad. But then she told me things she had seen and heard that I hadn’t noticed before. Her stories made me realize she was right. I thanked her for the advice and promised to be careful.

When we got to New York, they told me where they were staying and invited me to visit.
