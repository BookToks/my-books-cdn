After visiting places where skilled workers used their tools, I really enjoyed watching them work. It helped me learn enough to make small things myself when no mechanic was around. I could even build little machines for my experiments while the ideas were still fresh in my mind.

My father finally decided I should become a cutler, which means someone who makes knives. I was sent to try working with my cousin Samuel, who learned this trade in London and now worked in Boston. But my father didnâ€™t like how much Samuel wanted to charge for the apprenticeship, so I was sent back home.

Since I was very young, I loved reading a lot. I spent all the money I could get on books. I especially liked stories about voyages. The first books I bought were small volumes by Bunyan. Later, I sold those to buy a history collection by R. Burton, which had 24 books in it.
