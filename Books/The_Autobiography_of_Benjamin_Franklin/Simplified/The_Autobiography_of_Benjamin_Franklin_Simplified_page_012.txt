My family worked as blacksmiths for a long time, with the oldest son always learning the trade. Both my father and uncle followed this tradition for their oldest sons.  

When I looked at records in Eaton, I found no information about births, marriages, or deaths before 1555 because the parish register only went back that far. The register showed that I was the youngest son of the youngest branch of my family, going back five generations.  

My grandfather, Thomas, was born in 1598 and lived in Eaton until he was too old to work. He was a franklin, which means he owned a lot of land and was a free man. There were also other landowners and farmers in the area who could serve on juries.  

The old stories describe a franklin as a country gentleman who managed his home well. He carried a white silk purse on his belt, was a local knight and judge, and helped poor people and those in doubt.  

In everything he did, he was generous and fair, known for being polite and loved by all.
