Franklin and Josias stayed loyal to their beliefs from then on.

The rest of the family stayed in the Episcopal Church.

My father, Josias, got married when he was young.

Around 1682, he moved to New England with his wife and three kids. At that time, meetings for their religion were against the law and often broken up. Some important people he knew wanted to move to America because they hoped to practice their religion freely. My father decided to go with them.

With his first wife, my father had four more children born in America. With his second wife, he had ten more, making seventeen kids in total. I remember seeing thirteen of them sitting together at his table. They all grew up and got married. I was the youngest son and one of the youngest children, except for two sisters. I was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, who was one of the first settlers in New England. Cotton Mather even wrote good things about him in his church history.
