Some people think that if you get money or property from your family, you have to pass it on to the next generation. But this doesn’t apply to me because I never inherited any money or things from my family or relatives. Still, if nothing unexpected happens before I die, I plan to leave a good amount of money and property to my family and relatives. I’m saying this just to explain why I’m leaving gifts that might not seem to directly help them.

I was born in Boston, New England, and I learned to read and write at the free grammar schools there. Because of that, I have included those schools in my will.

I also feel grateful to the state of Massachusetts because they helped me without me asking.
