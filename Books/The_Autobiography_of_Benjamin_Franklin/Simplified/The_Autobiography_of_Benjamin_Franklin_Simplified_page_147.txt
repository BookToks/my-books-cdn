I was plainly dressed, and never seen in any place of public amusement. I never went a fishing or hunting. A book indeed enticed me sometimesfrom my work, but it was seldom, by stealth, and occasioned no scandal ; and to show that I did not think myselfabovemy profession, Iconveyedhome, sometimes in a wheelbarrow, the paper I had purchased at the warehouses.
