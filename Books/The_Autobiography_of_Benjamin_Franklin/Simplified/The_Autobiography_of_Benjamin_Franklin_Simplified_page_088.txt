Ralph was married and had a child, but he decided to come with me on this trip. Everyone thought he wanted to make business contacts to sell goods, but later I found out he was unhappy with his wife’s parents and planned to leave her with them and never come back to America.

After saying goodbye to my friends and promising Miss Read I would be faithful, I left Philadelphia. At Newcastle, the ship stopped. The Governor was there, so I went to see him.

His secretary was very polite and told me the Governor couldn’t meet me because he was busy with important matters. But he said he would send the letters to the ship and wished me a good trip and a quick return. I went back to the ship, a bit surprised but still not suspecting anything.

Mr. Hamilton, a famous lawyer from Philadelphia, had also booked a ticket to England.
