FRANKLIN.  
Philadelphia, Nov. 27, 1753.

Dear Sik,  

I already wrote you a lot through Bristol, so I don’t have much more to say. The academy is still the same as before. The trustees want to have a head teacher there, but they are afraid to take on new responsibilities until they pay off their debts.  

I haven’t convinced them yet that a really good teacher for advanced subjects would attract enough students to cover most or all of his pay. Unless the province leaders decide to help finish our school, I’m afraid it will take a few more years to get it to the level it could be now. All the excitement I had about you coming to work with us is starting to disappear.  

But good Mr. Collinson tells me he will keep trying, and he hopes the archbishop will help too.
