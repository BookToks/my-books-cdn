The plan was really good for the time, fitting both America’s and Great Britain’s situations well. It seemed to find a middle ground between their different interests.

Whether this plan could have stopped America from breaking away from Britain is something people can argue about. Some say that if the colonies could protect themselves, it would have stopped laws like the stamp act and tea act. These laws made people angry and helped start the fight for independence.

But on the other hand, Britain made rules that forced America to sell goods only to British people and buy certain things from them. Since American factories were not encouraged, they had to pay more for these items than if they bought from other countries. This would have made people unhappy, even if Britain didn’t add extra taxes. This problem might still have happened.
