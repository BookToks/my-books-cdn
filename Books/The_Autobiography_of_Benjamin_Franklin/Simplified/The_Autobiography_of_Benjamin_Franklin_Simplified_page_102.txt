PRANKLIN.

There was a spirit that haunted the chapel and bothered people who werenâ€™t allowed in regularly. I finally had to pay to get in, even though the master protected me. I realized it was silly not to get along with the people I had to live with.

After that, I got along really well with my coworkers and soon became pretty popular among them. I suggested some changes to the chapel rules, and everyone agreed.

Because of me, some of them stopped their bad habit of eating bread and cheese with beer. Instead, they got warm gruel with a little butter, toasted bread, and nutmeg from a nearby place. This breakfast was tastier, cost about the same as a pint of beer (three half-pennies), and helped keep their heads clearer. Those who kept drinking too much beer often lost favor with the pub owner.
