Lightning and electricity are the same thing, and he found many facts and reasons to prove this. In the same year, he had a really bold and amazing idea to test his theory by actually pulling lightning down using sharp iron rods that reached up into the clouds. Even though it was risky, he wanted to help people in a big way.

He knew that points could push away electricity and carry it quietly and safely. So, he thought of protecting houses, ships, and other things from lightning by putting up pointed rods that stick out above the highest part and go down into the ground or water. He believed these rods would either stop lightning by pushing the clouds away, or by taking the electricity from the clouds. If that didnâ€™t work, the rods would at least guide the electricity safely into the ground without hurting the building.
