Franklin helped set up a fair way to pay for running the government, making sure that property owners only paid their fair share of the costs.

After finishing this important work, Franklin stayed in Great Britain as a representative for Pennsylvania. Because he knew a lot about the colonies and cared about their needs, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Georgia also asked him to be their representative.

He did such a good job that more people back home liked and trusted him even more.

This gave him a chance to spend time with friends he made while he was away.

People liked him even more after meeting him in person. The criticism of his scientific ideas slowly stopped, and he started getting lots of awards for his smart work.
