There was a group of 1,200 men in Philadelphia called the 203rd regiment.

The enemy was attacking the northwestern border, so they needed to protect it. The Governor told Franklin to take charge of this.

He was given the power to raise soldiers and choose officers to lead them.

Franklin quickly gathered troops and went to the place where they were needed. He built a fort there and set up the soldiers to defend against attacks that had happened before. He stayed there for a while to make sure everything was safe. Later, some important work called him back to the Assembly in Philadelphia.

Protecting the colonies cost Great Britain a lot of money. The best way to spend less was to give weapons to the people living there and teach them how to use them. But England didnâ€™t want Americans to learn how to use weapons.
