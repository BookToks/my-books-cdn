FRANKLIN. 'S.l'.) There was a funny prayer made by a group called Jerika, or Pursuits, asking to stop piracy and slavery. This fake African speech was a great copy of one given by Mr. Jackson from Georgia.

All the reasons people used to support black slavery were also used to justify stealing and enslaving Europeans. This showed how weak the arguments for the slave trade really were, and also how smart and creative the author was, even though he was old.

It also proved how good he was at copying the style of other times and places, just like his famous story against persecution. That story made many people look in the Bible to find it, and this fake speech made many people search bookstores and libraries to find the book it was said to come from.

At the beginning of April after that, he got a fever and chest illness, which ended his life. His friend and doctor, Dr. Jones, wrote about his last sickness.
