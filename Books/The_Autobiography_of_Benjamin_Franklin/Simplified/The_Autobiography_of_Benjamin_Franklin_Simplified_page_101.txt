A penny loaf had only a small amount of flour, so if he ate this loaf and drank a pint of water with it, he would get more energy than from a pint of beer. But even though he knew this, he still drank his usual amount of beer and spent four or five shillings every Saturday night on this bad drink. I didn’t have to pay for that. This is how these poor people stay unhappy and poor their whole lives by their own choice.

After a few weeks, Watts needed me upstairs to work as a compositor, so I left the printing press. The compositors asked me to pay “garnish-money” again. I thought this was unfair because I had already paid before. The boss agreed and told me not to pay. So, I stayed out of their group for two or three weeks. Because of that, they acted like I was kicked out. When I wasn’t there, they played tricks on me. They mixed up my letters, switched my pages, and messed up my work. Everyone blamed me for these problems.
