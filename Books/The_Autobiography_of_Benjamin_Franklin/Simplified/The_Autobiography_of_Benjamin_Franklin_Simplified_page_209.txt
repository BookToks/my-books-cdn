The governors kept saying no to this plan, and without their approval, no bill could become a law. The Assembly got really angry at their stubbornness and what they thought were unfair actions by their opponents. So, they decided to ask the mother country for help.

They sent a petition to the king and his council, explaining the problems the people were facing because the proprietors cared more about their own interests than the communityâ€™s well-being. They asked for help to fix these issues.

Franklin was chosen to take this petition as the representative for Pennsylvania. He left America in June 1757. Following the instructions from the lawmakers, he met with the proprietors living in England and tried to convince them to give up the fight.

When they refused to agree, Franklin gave the petition to the council. Meanwhile, Governor Denny agreed to a new tax law that treated all estates the same, without any special favors.
