It wasn’t until the summer of 1752 that he finally finished his amazing discovery by doing an experiment. His original idea was to put a sentry box on a tall tower or some high place. From the box, he would have a painted iron rod sticking up, held in place by a lump of resin to keep it insulated. He thought that when electrified clouds passed by, they would give some electricity to the rod. You could see this electricity as sparks when you touched a key, your knuckle, or something else that could conduct electricity to the rod.

At that time, Philadelphia didn’t have a tall tower to try this experiment. While he was waiting for a tall spire to be built, he had a new idea. He realized he could reach the clouds more easily with a simple kite. He made one by attaching two sticks in a cross shape to a silk handkerchief, which wouldn’t get ruined by rain like paper would. On the vertical stick, he put an iron point. The kite string was mostly made of hemp, but the end near the kite was silk. At the point where the hemp string ended, he tied a key.
