He made changes based on his plan. The sweet sounds made Dr. Franklin try many experiments. Finally, he created a cool instrument called the Armonica.

In the summer of 1762, he went back to America. On the ship, he noticed something strange. When the boat moved, a container with oil floating on water acted weird. The oil stayed smooth and still, but the water was moving a lot. No one has really explained why this happens.

Dr. Franklin was thanked by the Pennsylvania Assembly. They said it was not just for doing his job well in Pennsylvania, but also for the many important things he did for America while living in Great Britain. They also gave him 5,000 Pennsylvania currency for his six years of work.

While he was away, people kept choosing him to be in the Assembly every year. When he came back to Pennsylvania, he took his seat again.
