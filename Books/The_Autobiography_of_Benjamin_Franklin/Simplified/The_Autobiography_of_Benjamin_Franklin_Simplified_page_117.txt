Franklin was about eighteen years old and told me some details about his life. He was born in Gloucester and went to a grammar school. He was really good at acting and stood out when his class put on plays. He was also part of a book club in town, and some of his writing, both stories and poems, appeared in the Gloucester newspapers.

After that, he went to Oxford and stayed there for about a year. But he wasn’t happy and really wanted to see London and become an actor. One day, he got fifteen guineas to pay for his school fees, but instead of staying, he ran away with the money, hid his school gown in a hedge, and traveled to London.

When he got to London, he didn’t know anyone to help him. He quickly fell in with bad people, spent all his money, couldn’t meet any actors, lost respect, had to pawn his clothes, and didn’t have enough food. One day, while walking the streets, very hungry and unsure what to do, he saw a recruiting poster.
