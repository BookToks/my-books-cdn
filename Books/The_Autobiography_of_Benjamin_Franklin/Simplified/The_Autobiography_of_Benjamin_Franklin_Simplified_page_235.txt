He signed the constitution they made for the union and showed clearly that he agreed with it.

Around this time, a group for political discussions was started, and Dr. Franklin was the leader. They met at his house. A few essays from this group were published, but it didn’t last long.

In 1787, two groups were started in Philadelphia based on kindness and fairness. One was the Philadelphia Society to help people in public prisons, and the other was the Pennsylvania Society to end slavery, free Black people who were held unfairly, and improve the lives of African Americans. Dr. Franklin was the leader of both groups.

These groups worked hard and had a lot of success. They kept working with great energy on their important goals.

Because Dr. Franklin’s health got worse, he couldn’t go to meetings often, and in 1788, he stopped working in public life completely.
