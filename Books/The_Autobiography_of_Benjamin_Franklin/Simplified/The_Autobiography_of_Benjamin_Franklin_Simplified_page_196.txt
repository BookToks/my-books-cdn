Franklin spent most of his life working abroad in similar jobs. Because of this, he didn’t have many chances to be involved in the school’s affairs until he came back in 1785. When he returned, he saw that the school’s rules had been broken, and the original founders had lost control because of a new law.

Even though Franklin’s name was added to the list of new trustees, he chose not to join them or help run things until the school was given back to its original owners by the law. After that, he brought his old friends together at his house and was picked as their leader. From then on, all their meetings were held at his home until just a few months before he died. At that point, he agreed to meet at the college, but only because his friends worried about him getting too tired from their work.

Franklin didn’t just create many useful groups himself; he also helped support those that already existed.
