The colonists loved their home country at first, but after being treated badly over and over, they started to lose their feelings for it. They didn’t listen to advice and kept doing their own thing, leaving the colonists with only two choices: fight back or give up completely. Giving up didn’t fit with their beliefs about freedom, so they had to choose to fight, even if they didn’t want to.

Dr. Franklin saw that trying to fix things between Great Britain and the colonies wasn’t working, so he came back to America in 1775, right after the fighting started. The day after he got back, Pennsylvania’s government picked him to be a delegate to Congress. Soon after, he was part of a group with Mr. Lynch and Mr. Harrison that went to the army camp at Cambridge. Together with the army leader, they tried to convince the soldiers, whose time in the army was almost up, to keep fighting for their country.
