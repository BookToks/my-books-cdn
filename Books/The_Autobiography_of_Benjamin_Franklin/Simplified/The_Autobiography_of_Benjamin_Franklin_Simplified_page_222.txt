Franklin had some work published that showed how much he knew and how easily he could share his ideas. He explained facts so clearly that anyone without bias could see the act was a bad idea. After some opposition, the act was canceled about a year after it started, before it was ever put into action.

In 1766, he visited Holland and Germany and got a lot of respect from scientists there. While traveling through Holland, he learned from the boatmen that having less water in the canals made it harder for boats to move. When he got back to England, he did many experiments that proved this idea was true. He wrote about these experiments and explained what was happening in a letter to his friend, Sir John Pringle, which is one of his science writings.

The next year, he traveled to France, where he was welcomed just as warmly as he had been in Germany.
