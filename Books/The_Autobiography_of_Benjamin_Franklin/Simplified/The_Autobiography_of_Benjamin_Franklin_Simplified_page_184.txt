The last part of the main rule is written in very kind and caring words, showing how much the founders really cared.

It says that the trustees should enjoy visiting the academy often. They should encourage the students and support the teachers. They should do everything they can to help the school succeed and be respected.

The trustees are asked to think of the students like their own children. They should treat them kindly and with affection. When the students have done well and finished their studies, the trustees should work hard to help them succeed in life—whether in jobs, government positions, marriages, or anything else—before helping others, even if those others are just as good.

After this rule was signed and shared with the public, the names of the trustees and founders were announced.
