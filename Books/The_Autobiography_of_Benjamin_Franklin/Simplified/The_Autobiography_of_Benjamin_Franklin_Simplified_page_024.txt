Franklin was involved in other peopleâ€™s private matters and was often asked to help solve arguments between them.

He liked to have friends or smart neighbors over for dinner whenever he could. They would have good conversations, and he made sure to talk about useful or clever ideas that could help his children learn. This helped us pay attention early on to what was fair, wise, and helpful in how to live.

He never talked about the food on the table, never said if it tasted good or bad, or if it was cooked well or not. Because of this, from when I was very young, I learned not to care much about food. Even now, I hardly remember what I ate a few hours after dinner. When I travel, this habit has helped me a lot.
