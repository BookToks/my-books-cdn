He had a stone that caused him pain for several years, and in the last year, it kept him mostly in bed. When the pain got really bad, he had to take strong medicine to help ease it.

Even when he wasnâ€™t in pain, he kept himself busy by reading, talking happily with his family and some friends who came to see him. He also worked on both public and personal business with people who visited him. He always showed kindness and a strong desire to help others, which was a big part of who he was. He was very sharp mentally and often enjoyed sharing funny stories and clever jokes that everyone loved.

About sixteen days before he died, he caught a fever without any clear symptoms at first. After three or four days, he started feeling a sharp pain in his left chest that kept getting worse.
