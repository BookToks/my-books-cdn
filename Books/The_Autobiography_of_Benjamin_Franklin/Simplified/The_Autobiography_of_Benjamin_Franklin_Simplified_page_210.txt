The Penn family got really worried when they heard about Franklin’s efforts. They tried their best to stop the king from approving a law they thought was very unfair. They said it would make them pay too much for running the government and would cause big problems for them and their future families.

The issue was talked about a lot in front of the privy council. The Penns found some strong supporters there, but some people also stood up for the regular people. After a while, someone suggested that Franklin should promise that the tax would be fair, so the Penn family wouldn’t have to pay more than their share.

Franklin agreed to this promise. The Penn family then stopped opposing the law, and peace returned to the province.

The way this disagreement ended shows how much people respected Franklin’s honesty and honor, even those who didn’t agree with him. And their trust in him was not wrong.
