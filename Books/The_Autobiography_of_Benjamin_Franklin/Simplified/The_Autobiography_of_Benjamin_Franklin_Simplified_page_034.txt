Back then, if I had kept writing poems, I would have learned a lot. I needed words that meant the same thing but were different lengths for the rhythm, or sounded different for the rhyme. This pushed me to find lots of synonyms and helped me get really good at using them.

Because of this, I took some stories from the Spectator and turned them into poems. Later, when I had forgotten them a bit, I changed them back into regular writing.

Sometimes, I mixed all my notes together. A few weeks later, I tried to put them in the best order before making full essays. I did this to learn how to organize my thoughts better.

When I looked at my work compared to the original, I saw many mistakes and fixed them. But sometimes I was happy because, in small ways, I had made the ideas or style better. This made me hope that, over time, I could write well in English.
