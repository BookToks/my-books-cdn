FRANKLIN.

There was a clever young man with a great reputation in town. He was the secretary to the Assembly and a pretty good poet. Keimer also tried writing poems, but they weren’t very good.

He didn’t really write in proper verse because he just wrote lines as they came to him. He worked without a copy, had only one set of letters for printing, and his elegy probably used all his letters. So, no one could really help him.

I tried to fix his printing press, which he hadn’t used before and didn’t understand. I promised to come back and help print his elegy when it was ready. Then, I went to Bradford’s house, where he gave me some small jobs to do and let me stay there.

A few days later, Keimer called me to print his elegy. He had gotten another set of letters and had a pamphlet to reprint. He put me to work on it.

Both printers in Philadelphia seemed to lack the skills needed for their job. Bradford wasn’t trained for it and was not very educated.
