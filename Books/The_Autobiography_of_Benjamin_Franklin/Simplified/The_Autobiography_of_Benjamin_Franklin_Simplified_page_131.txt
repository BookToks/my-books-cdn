Franklin met a man who was always negative and believed everything was going to get worse. This guy told Franklin many sad stories about bad things that were happening or about to happen, which made Franklin feel almost hopeless. If Franklin had known this man before starting his business, he probably wouldnâ€™t have taken the risk.

The man kept living in a rundown place and kept complaining for years. He refused to buy a house because he thought everything was falling apart. But later, Franklin felt satisfied when the man paid five times more for a house than it would have cost if he had bought it when he first started complaining.

I should also mention that during the fall of the year before, I gathered most of the smart people I knew into a club called the Junto. The goal was to help us learn and grow.

We met every Friday night. I made rules that said each member had to take turns asking questions about things like right and wrong, politics, or philosophy.
