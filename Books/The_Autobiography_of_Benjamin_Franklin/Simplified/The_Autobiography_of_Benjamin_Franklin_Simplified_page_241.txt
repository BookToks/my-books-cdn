Here is part of the last will and testament of Dr. Franklin.

About my books, the ones I had in France and the ones I left in Philadelphia are now all together here, and I have made a list of them. I plan to give them out like this:

My "History of the Academy of Sciences," which has about 60 or 70 big volumes, I give to the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, where I am the president.

My big collection called "Les Arts et les Metiers" I give to the American Philosophical Society in New England, where I am a member. My smaller edition of the same book, called "Arts et Metiers," I give to the Library Company of Philadelphia.

Any books I mark with the name of my grandson Benjamin Franklin Bache on the list, I give to him. Any I mark with the name of my grandson William Bache, I give to him. And any books marked with the name Jonathan Williams, I give to my cousin with that name.
