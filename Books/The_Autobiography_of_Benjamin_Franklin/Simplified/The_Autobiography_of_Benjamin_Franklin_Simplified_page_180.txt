176 LIFE OF Dll. FRANKLIN.
 
 In the year 1745, Franklin published an account of his new invented Pennsylvania fireplaces, in which he minutely and accuratelystates the advantages of different kinds of fireplaces; and endeavors to show, that the one which he describes is to be preferred to any other. This contrivance has given rise to the open stoves now in general use, which, however, differ from itin construction, particularly in not having an air-box at the back, through which a constant supply ofair, warmed in its passage, is thrown into the room. The advantages of this air, that as a stream ofwarm air is continuallyflowinginto the room, less fuel is necessary to preserve a proper temperature, andthe room may be so tightened as that no air may enter through â€” the cracks the consequence of which are colds, toothaches, &c.
 
 Although philosophy was a principal object of Franklin's pursuit for several years, he confined himself not to this. In the year 1747, he became a member of the general assembly of Pennsylvania, as a burgess for the city of Philadelphia. Warm disputes subsisted at this time between the Assembly LirE OJT DR.
