In 1745, Franklin wrote about his new Pennsylvania fireplaces. He carefully explained the benefits of different types of fireplaces and tried to prove that his design was the best. This idea led to the open stoves people use today, but those stoves are built differently. For example, they don’t have an air-box at the back, which in Franklin’s design sends warm air into the room all the time.

The warm air coming in means you need less fuel to keep the room warm. Also, the room can be sealed tight so no cold air sneaks in through cracks. This helps stop problems like colds and toothaches that come from cold drafts.

Even though Franklin spent a lot of time studying science, he didn’t focus only on that. In 1747, he joined the Pennsylvania general assembly as a representative for Philadelphia. At that time, there were strong arguments happening in the Assembly.
