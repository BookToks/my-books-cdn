Franklin took the chance right away when he saw the offer of a reward for anyone willing to serve in America. He went straight to the meeting place, signed up, got on a ship, and sailed to America without telling his parents what had happened to him.

He was smart and had a good personality, which made him a great friend, but he was also lazy, careless, and very reckless.

John, the Irishman, ran away soon. I started to enjoy life with the others.

They respected me more because they saw that Keimer couldn’t teach them well and because they learned something new from me every day. We never worked on Saturdays since it was Keimer’s day off, so I had two days a week to read.

I got to know more smart and interesting people in town.

Even Keimer treated me kindly and seemed to respect me. The only thing that bothered me was the debt I owed Vernon, which I couldn’t pay yet.
