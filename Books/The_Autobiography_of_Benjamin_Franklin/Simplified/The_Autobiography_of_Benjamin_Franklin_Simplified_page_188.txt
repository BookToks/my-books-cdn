FRANKLIN.

From what was said before, these letters will make things clear. They were written by Franklin to a man who had just shared an idea for a college that would fit a young country like New York. This man sent Franklin a copy of his idea to get his opinion.

Because of this, they started writing to each other. About a year later, they built the college based on the academy that already existed. The man who had the idea became the leader of both the college and the academy. He has been in charge for thirty-six years and is still well respected.

These letters also show what the academy was like back then.

Philadelphia, April 19, 1768.

"Sir,

I got your letter from the 11th with your new piece about education. I will read it carefully and send you my thoughts by the next mail."
