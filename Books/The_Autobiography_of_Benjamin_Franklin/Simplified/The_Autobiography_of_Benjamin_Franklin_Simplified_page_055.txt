FRANKLIN. 51 I offered to pay the boatmen for my ride. At first, they didn’t want to take money because I helped row, but I made them accept it.

Sometimes, people are kinder when they have little money than when they have a lot. Maybe it’s because when they have little, they want to hide that they are poor.

I walked up the street, looking carefully on both sides until I reached Market Street. There, I saw a child with a loaf of bread. I had often eaten dry bread for dinner. I asked him where he bought it and went straight to the bakery he showed me.

I asked for some biscuits, hoping they were like the ones we had in Boston, but they didn’t have those in Philadelphia. Then I asked for a threepenny loaf, but they didn’t sell bread at that price. Since I didn’t know the prices or types of bread, I asked for threepenny worth of any kind of bread. The baker gave me three big rolls. I was surprised to get so much, but I took them anyway. I didn’t have pockets, so I carried a roll under each arm as I walked.
