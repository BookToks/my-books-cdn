Franklin’s ideas about government are summed up in his writings. He liked the idea of having one law-making group and several leaders sharing power.

At the end of 1776, Dr. Franklin was chosen to help with talks started by Silas Deane in France. The French court was interested in trading with America and wanted to weaken Britain by breaking up its empire. This made them listen to the idea of an alliance.

At first, the French were unsure about the plan, but Dr. Franklin’s speech and the American army’s win against General Burgoyne changed their minds. In February 1778, they signed a treaty to help each other in the war, so France joined the fight against Britain.

No one could have helped the United States more in France than Dr. Franklin. He was famous as a thinker, and people respected his character.
