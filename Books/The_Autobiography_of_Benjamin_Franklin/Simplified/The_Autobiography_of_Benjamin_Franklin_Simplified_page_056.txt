I walked down Market Street to Fourth Street and passed the house of Mr. Read, the father of the girl I was going to marry. She was standing at the door and saw me. She probably thought I looked really strange and funny.

Then I turned the corner and walked along Chestnut Street, eating my roll the whole time. After that, I ended up back at Market Street wharf, near the boat I came on. I stepped onto the boat to take a drink of river water. Since I liked my first roll, I gave the other two to a woman and her child who were traveling with us on the boat and waiting to continue their trip.

Feeling better, I went back to the street, which was now full of well-dressed people all going the same way. I followed them and ended up at a big Quaker meeting-house near the market. I sat down with everyone else. After looking around for a while and hearing nothing, I got sleepy from working hard last night and not resting. I fell into a deep sleep and stayed that way until LIFE OF DR.
