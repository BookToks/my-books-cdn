George Webb found a friend who lent him the money to buy out his time from Keimer. One day, he came to offer his help as a journeyman. We couldn’t hire him right away, but I foolishly told him in secret that I planned to start a new newspaper soon, and then we would have work for him.

I believed my idea would work because the only newspaper in Philadelphia at that time, printed by Bradford, was a bad one. It was boring and poorly done, but still made money. So, I thought a good paper like mine would definitely be successful. 

But Webb told Keimer my secret. To stop me, Keimer quickly announced he would start his own paper and that Webb would work for him.

I was really upset about this. Since I couldn’t start my own paper yet, I wrote some funny articles in Bradford’s paper called the Busy Body to fight back.
