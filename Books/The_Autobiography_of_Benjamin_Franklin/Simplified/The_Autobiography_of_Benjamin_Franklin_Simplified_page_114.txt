Early in February 1727, when I was about 21 years old, we both got sick. I had a bad lung infection that almost killed me. I suffered a lot and thought I was going to die. When I found out I might get better, I felt a bit sad because I knew I would probably have to go through this terrible experience again someday.

I donâ€™t remember what illness Mr. Denham had, but it lasted a long time, and he eventually died from it. He left me a small amount of money in his will to show he cared about me. After that, I was left alone in the world. The warehouse was given to someone else to manage, and they let me go.

My brother-in-law, Holmes, who was in Philadelphia at the time, told me to go back to my old job. Keimer offered to pay me a good salary if I ran his printing shop so he could focus on his store. But his wife and family in London had said bad things about him, and I was hesitant because of that.
