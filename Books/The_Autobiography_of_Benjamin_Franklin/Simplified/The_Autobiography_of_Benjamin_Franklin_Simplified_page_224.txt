No one ever found out how he got them.

Soon after, the Massachusetts assembly’s petition was reviewed by the privy council. Dr. Franklin was there representing the assembly. The solicitor general, Wedderburne, who worked for Oliver and Hutchinson, attacked Franklin with harsh and unfair words. The petition was called offensive and annoying, and it was rejected.

Even though the British parliament got rid of the Stamp Act, they did it because it was easier, not because they changed their minds. They still believed they had the right to tax the colonies. At the same time they repealed the Stamp Act, they passed another law saying parliament had the right to control the colonies in every way. This idea was shared even by those who strongly opposed the Stamp Act, like Mr. Pitt.

The colonists never accepted this right. But because they hoped Britain wouldn’t actually use it, they didn’t complain too much.
