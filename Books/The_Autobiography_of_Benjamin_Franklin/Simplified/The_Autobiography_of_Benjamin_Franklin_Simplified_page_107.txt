At the printing house, I became close friends with a smart young man named Wygate. His parents were well-off, so he had a better education than most printers. He knew some Latin, spoke French well, and loved reading. 

I taught him and a friend of his how to swim by taking them into the river just twice. After that, they didn’t need any more help. 

One day, we all went on a boat trip to Chelsea to see the College and Don Soltero’s curiosities. On the way back, the group asked me to swim. So, I took off my clothes and jumped into the river. 

I swam all the way from near Chelsea to Blackfriars Bridge. While swimming, I did many cool tricks both on top of and under the water. This amazed and pleased the people who had never seen anything like it before. 

When I was young, I really enjoyed swimming. I knew how to do many different moves.
