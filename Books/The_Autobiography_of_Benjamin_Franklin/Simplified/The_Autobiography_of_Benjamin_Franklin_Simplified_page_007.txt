My dear Sok, I have spent some time collecting little stories about my family. You might remember when you were with me in England, I asked some of my relatives about our family history. I even went on a trip to find out more.

I think knowing the details about my parents and my life, which you don’t know yet, will be interesting for you just like it is for me. I will write these stories down. It will be a fun way to spend a week while I’m resting in the country.

There are also other reasons why I want to do this.
