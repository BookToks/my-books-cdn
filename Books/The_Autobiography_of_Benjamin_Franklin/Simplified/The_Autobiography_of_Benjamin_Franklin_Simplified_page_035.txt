One of my biggest goals was to improve myself.

I used the time after work, before work, and on Sundays (when I didn’t have to go to church) to practice and read. When I lived with my dad, he made sure I went to church on time. I still thought going was important, but I felt like I didn’t have time for it.

When I was about sixteen, I found a book by Tryon that suggested eating only vegetables. I decided to try it. My brother didn’t have his own place and ate with his apprentices nearby. They didn’t like that I wouldn’t eat meat, and I got scolded for being different. I learned how Tryon cooked things like boiled potatoes, rice, and quick puddings.

Then I told my brother that if he gave me half the money he paid for my food each week, I would take care of myself. He agreed right away.
