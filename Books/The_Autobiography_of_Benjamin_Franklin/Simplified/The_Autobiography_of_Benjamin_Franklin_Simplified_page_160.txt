One year, all the wise sayings were put together in a letter called "The Way to Wealth." This letter has been translated into many languages and printed in different books. It was also made into a big sheet that many people in this city hang up in their homes. This letter probably has the best practical advice about saving money ever written. It is easy to understand and makes readers see why the advice is fair and useful.

So many people wanted this almanac that ten thousand copies were sold in one year, which is a lot, especially because the country didn’t have many people back then. It’s clear that the good advice in these almanacs helped many readers.

Not long after, Franklin started his political work. In 1736, he was made clerk for Pennsylvania’s general assembly and was chosen again later.
