Franklin said 55 could work, but right now he didn’t have any jobs for me. He said he would soon have something for me to do. At the same time, he talked to old Bradford, who lived in town and was friendly with him. He told Bradford about his plan and how he thought it might succeed. Bradford was careful not to say he was the father of another printer. From what Keimer said about hoping to take over most of the town’s printing business, Bradford asked smart questions and pointed out some problems. This made Keimer reveal all his plans, what he hoped for, and how he wanted to make it happen. I was there and heard everything. I quickly realized one of them was really clever, and the other was new at this. Bradford left me with Keimer, who was surprised when I told him who Bradford was.

I saw that Keimer’s printing stuff was old and broken. He had an old, damaged press and a small set of worn-out English letters. He was working on a sad poem about Aquila Rose, who I mentioned earlier.
