My brothers all started learning different jobs. As for me, when I was eight years old, I went to a grammar school. My dad wanted me to join the church and thought I would be the family’s chaplain.

Since I learned to read very quickly as a kid—I don’t even remember not knowing how—and some family friends said I would become a scholar someday, my dad believed this plan was right.

My uncle Benjamin also liked the idea and said he would give me all his sermon books, which he wrote in his own shorthand, if I would learn to read it.

But I only stayed about a year at the school on Nantucket Island.
