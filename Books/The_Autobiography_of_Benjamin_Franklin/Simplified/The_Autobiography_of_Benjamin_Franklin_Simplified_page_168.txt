A long time ago, in 1747, Franklin studied something called the Leyden phial. This was a device that had confused many smart people. He explained it using his idea of plus and minus electrical states. 

Franklin showed that when the bottle was charged, it didn’t actually have more electricity than before. Instead, electricity was taken from one side and put on the other. To make the electricity go away, you just needed to connect the two sides so they could balance out again.

He also did experiments to prove that the electricity wasn’t in the metal coating on the bottle, like people thought. Instead, it was in the tiny holes inside the glass. After charging the bottle, he took off the metal coating and put on a new one, and it still gave a shock.

In 1749, Franklin suggested that things like thunder storms and the northern lights could be explained by electricity too.
