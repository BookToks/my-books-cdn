. FRANKLIN, J 111J 11, lcS47, several months prior. Shortly after, Franklin, from his principles of the plus and minus state, explained in a satisfactory manner, the phenomena of the Leyden phial, first observed by Mr. Cuneus, or by Professor Muschenbroeck, of Leyden, which had muchperplexedphilosophers. He showed clearly, that the bottle, when charged, containednomore electricitythanbefore, but that as much was taken from one side as was thrown on the other ; and that, to discharge it, nothing was necessary but to produce a communication between the two sides, by which the equilibrium might be restored, and that then no signs of electricity would remain. He afterwards demonstrated, by experiments, that the electricity did not reside in the coating, as had been supposed, but in the pores of the glass itself. After a phial was charged, he removed the coating, and found that upon applying a new coating the shock might still be received. In the year 1749, he first suggested his idea of explaining the phenomena of thunder gusts, and of the auroraborealis, uponelectricalprinciples.
