FRANKLIN. 201 some regiments of regular troops and provincial levies, was sent to dispossess the French of tho posts upon which they had seized. After the men were all ready, a difficulty occurred, which had nearly prevented the expedition. This wasthe want ofwagons.
 
 Franklin now stepped forward, and with the assistance of his son, in a little time procured a hundred and fifty. Braddock unfortunately fell into an ambuscade, and perished, with a number of his men. Washington, who had accompanied him as an aid-de-camp, and had warned him, in vain, of his danger, now displayed great military talents in efiecting a retreat of the remains of the army, and in forming a junction with the rear, under Colonel Dunbar, upon whom the chief command now devolved. With some difficulty they brought their little body to a place of safety, but they found it necessary to destroy their wagons and baggage, to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy. For the wagons, which hehadfurnished, Franklin had given bonds to a large amount. The owners declared their intention of obliging him to make a restitution of their property.
