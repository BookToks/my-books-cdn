These as they are stated in my great folio ledger, E, I bequeath to the contributors of the Pennsylvania hospital, hoping that those debtors, and the descendants of such as are deceased, who now, as I find, make some difficulty of satisfying such antiquated demands asjust debts, may, however, be inducedto payorgive them as charitytothatexcellent institution. Iam sensible that much must be inevitably lost; but I hope something considerable may be recovered. It is possible, too, that some of the parties charged mayhave existing old unsettled accounts against me : in which case the managers of the said hospital will allow and deduct the amount, or pay the balance, if they find it against me.
 
 I request my friends, Henry Hill, Esq., John Jay, Esq., Francis Hopkinson, and Mr.
 
 Edward Duffield of Bonfield, in Philadelphia county, to be the executors of this my last will and testament, and I hereby nominate and appoint them for that purpose.
 
 I would have mybody buried with as little expense or ceremony as may be.
