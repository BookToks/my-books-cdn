FEANKLIN. 177 and the Proprietaries each contending for ; what they conceived to be their just rights.
 
 Franklin, a friend to the rights of man from his infancy, soon distinguished himself a steady opponent of the unjust schemes ofthe proprietaries. He was soon looked upto as the head of the opposition ; and to him have been attributed many of the spirited replies of the Assembly to the messages of the governors. His influence in the body was very great. This arose not from any superior powers of eloquence he spoke but seldom, ; and he never was known to make any thing like an elaborate harangue. His speeches often consisted of a single sentence, ofa well told story, the moral of which was obviously to the point. He never attempted the flowery fields of oratory. His manner was plain and mild. His style in speaking was, like that of his writings, simple, unadorned, and remarkably concise. Withthis plainmanner, and his penetrating and solid judgment, he was able to confound the most eloquent and subtle ofhis adversaries, to confirm the opinions of his friends, and to make converts of the unprejudicedwho had opposedhim.
