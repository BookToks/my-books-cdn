It was said, that the Abbe Nollet, 1748, had suggested the idea of the similarity of lightning and electricity in his Legons de Pliysique. It is true that the Abbe mentions the idea, but he throws it out as a bare conjecture, and proposes no mode of a,scertaining the truth ofit. Hehimselfacknowledges, that Franklin first entertained the bold thought of bringing lightning from the heavens, by means of pointed rods fixed in the air. The similarity of lightning and electricity is so strong, that we need not be surprised at notice being taken of it, as soon as electrical phenomena became familiar. We find it mentioned by Dr. Wall and Mr. Gray, while the science was in its infancy. But the honor of forming a regular theory of thunder gusts, of suggesting a mode of determining the truth of it by experiments, and of putting these experiments in practice, and thus establishing the theory, upon a firm and solid basis, is incontestably due to Franklin. D'Alibard, who made the first experiments in France, says, that he only 172 LIFE OF DR.
