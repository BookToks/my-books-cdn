FRANKLIN things, that onr new printing-house, bcii^g tlie subject of conversation at a club of merchants, who met every evening, it was the general opinion that itwould fail, there being alrer,v.'j t>70 printing-houses in the town, Kei-ner's and Bradford's. But Dr. Bard, whom you and I had occasion to see, many years after, at his native town of St. Andrew's, in Scotland, was of a different opinion. "The industry of this Franklin (said he) is superior to any thing of thekind Ihave ever witnessed. I see him still atwork when I return from the club at night, and he is at it again in the morning before his neighbors are out of bed." This account struck the rest of the assembly,- and, shortly after, one ofits members came to ourhouse, and offered to supply us with articles of stationery ; but we wished not as yet to embarrass ourselves with keeping a shop. It is not for the sake of applause that I enter so freely into the particulars of my industry, but that such of my descendants as shall read these memoirs may know the use of this virtue, by seeing in the recital ofmy life tho effects it operated my in favor.
