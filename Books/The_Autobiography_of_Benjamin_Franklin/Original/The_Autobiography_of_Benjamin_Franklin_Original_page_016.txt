; 12 LIFE OF DR. FRANKLIN.
 
 Ourhumble familyhad early embracedthe Reformation. They remained faithfully attached during thereign of QueenMary, when they were in danger ofbeing molested on account oftheir zeal againstpopery. Theyhad an English Bible, and, to conceal itthe more securely, they conceived the project of fastening it, open, with packthreads across the leaves, on the inside of the lid of the closestool. When my great-grandfather wished to read to his family, he reversed the lid of the close^tool uponhis knees, andpassedthe leaves from one side to the other, which were held down on each by the packthread. One of the children was stationed at the door, to give notice if he saw the proctor (an officer of the spiritual court) make his appearance in that case, the lid was restored to its place, with the Bible concealed under it as before.
