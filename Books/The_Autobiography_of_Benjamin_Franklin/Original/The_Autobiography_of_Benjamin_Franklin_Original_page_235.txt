LIFE OF PR. FRANKLIN. 231 ITe signed the constitution which thej proposed for the union, and gave it the most unequivocal marks of his approbation.
 
 A society for political inquiries, of which Dr. Franklin was president, was established about this period. The meetings were held at his house. Two or three essays read in this society were published. It did not long continue.
 
 In the year 1787, two societies were established in Philadelphia, founded on the principles of the mostliberal and refined humanity â€” The Philadelphia Society for alleviating themiseriesofpublicprisons; andthePennsylvania Society for promoting the abolition of slavery^ the relief offree negroes unlawfully held in bondage^ and the improvement of the condition of the African race. Of each of these Dr. Franklin was president.
 
 The labors of these bodies have been crowned with great success; and they continue to prosecute, with unwearied diligence, the laudable designs for which they were established.
 
 Dr. Franklin's increasing infirmities prevented his regular attendance at the council chamber; and, in 1788, he retired wholly from public life.
