IÂ»AlfKLIN. 165 lightning and electricity agree ; and he adduces many facts, and reasonings from facts, in support of his positions. In the sameyear he conceived the astonishinglybold andgrand idea of ascertaining the truth of his doctrine, by actually drawing down the lightning, by means ofsharp pointed iron rods raised into the region of the clouds. Even in this uncertain state, his passion to be useful to mankind displays itself in a powerful m^rner.
 
 Admitting the identityofelectricity and lightning, and knowing the power ofpoints in repelling bodies charged with electricity, and in conducting their fire silently and imperceptibly, he suggested the idea of securing houses, ships, &c., from being damaged by lightning, by erecting pointed rods, that should rise some feet above the most elevated part, and descend some feet into the ground or the water. The effect of these, he concluded, would be either to prevent a stroke by repelling the cloud beyond the striking distance, or by drawing off the electrical fire which it contained ; or, if they could not not effect this, they would at least conduct the electric matter to the earth, withou* any injury to the building.
