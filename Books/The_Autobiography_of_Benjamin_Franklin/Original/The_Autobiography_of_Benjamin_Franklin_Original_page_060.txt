FRANKLIN.
 
 an ingenious joung man, and of an excellent character, highly esteemed in the town, secretary to the Assembly, and a very tolerable poet. Keimer also made verses, but they were indifferent ones. He could not be said to write in verse, for his method was to set the lines as they flowed from his muse ; and as he worked without copy, had but one set ofletter-cases, and the elegy would probably occupy all his types, it was impossible for any one to assist him, I endeavored to put his press in order, which hehadnot yetused, and of which indeed he understood nothing i and, having promised to come and work ofl his elegy as soon as it should be ready, I returned to the house of Bradford, who gave me some trifle to do for the present, for which I had my board and lodging.
 
 In a few days Keimer sent for me to print offhis elegy. He had nowprocured another set of letter-cases, and had a pamphlet to reprint, upon which he set me to work.
 
 The two Philadelphia printers appeared destitute of every qualification necessary in their profession. Bradford had not been brought up to it, and was very illiterate.
