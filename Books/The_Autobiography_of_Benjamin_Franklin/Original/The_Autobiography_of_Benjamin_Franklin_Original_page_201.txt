FRANKLIN. 107 duties, imposts, or taxes, as they sliouM find necessary, and as would be least burdensome to the people. All laws were to be sent to England for the king's approbation ; and, unless disapprovedofwithin threeyears, were to remain in force. All officers of the land or sea service were to be nominated by the presidentgeneral, and approved ofbythegeneral council ; civil officers were to be nominated by the council, and approved of by the president.

It was disapproved ofby the ministry of Great Britain, because it gave too much power to the representatives of the people ; and it was rejected by every assembly, as giving to the president general, the representative ofthe crown, an influence greater than appeared to them proper, in a plan of government intended for freemen.
