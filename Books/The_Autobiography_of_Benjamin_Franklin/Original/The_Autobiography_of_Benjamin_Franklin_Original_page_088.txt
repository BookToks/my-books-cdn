84 LIFE OP DR. TRANKLIN.
 
 Ralph, though he was married and had a child, determined to accompany me in thia voyage. His object was supposed to be the establishing a correspondence withsome mercantile houses, in order to sell goods by commission but I afterwards learned that, hav; ing reason to be dissatisfied with the parents of his wife, he proposed to himself to leave her on their hands, and never retui'n to America again.
 
 /'Having taken leave of my friends, and interchanged promises of fidelity with Miss Read, I quitted Philadelphia. At Newcastle the vessel came to anchor. The Governor was arrived, and I went to his lodgings.
 
 His secretary received me with great civility, told me, on the part of the Governor, that he could not see me then, as he was engaged in afiairs of the utmost importance, but that he would send the letters on board, and that he wished me, with all his heart, a good voy^ age and speedy return. I returned, somewhat astonished, to the ship, but still without entertaining the slightest suspicion.
