 The following were the persons I found in his printing-house.
 
 Hugh Meredith, a Pennsylvanian, about thirty-fiveyears ofage. He had been brought up to husbandry, was honest, sensible, had some experience, and was fond of reading but too much addicted to drinking.
 
 Stephen Potts, a young rustic, just broke from school, and ofrustic education, with endowments rather above the common order, and a competent portion of understanding and gaiety ; but a little idle. Keimer had engaged these two at very low wages, which he had promised to raise every three months a shilling a week, provided their improvement in the typographic art should merit it. This future increase of wages was the bait he had made use of to ensnare them.
 
 Meredith was to work at the press, and Potts to bind books, which he had engaged to teach them, though he understood neither himself.
