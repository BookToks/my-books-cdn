FttANKLIN'B WILL. 249 erate wiiliin one year after my decease for ; which purpose due notice should be pubUcly given, previous to the expiration of that year, that those for whose benefit this estabhshment is intended may make their respective applications: and I hereby direct my executors, the survivors and survivor of them, within six months after my decease, to pay over the said sum of two thousand pounds sterling to such persons as shall be duly appointed by the select men of Boston, and the corporation of Philadelphia, and to receive and take charge of their respective sums of one thousand pounds each for the purposes aforesaid. Considering the accidents to which all human affairs and projects are subject in such a length of time, I have perhaps too much flattered myself with a vain fancy, that these dispositions, if carried into execution, will be continued without interruption, and have the effects proposed ; I hope, however, thatif the inhabitants of the two cities should not think fit to undertake the execution, they will at least accept the offer ofthese donations, as a mark of my good will, token ofmygratitude, and testimony of my desire to be useful to 250 EXTRACTS FROM, ETC.
