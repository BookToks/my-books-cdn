/ My deab Sok, IHAVE amusedmyself with collecting some little anecdotes of my family. You may remember the inquiries I made, when you were with me in England, among such ofmy relations as were then living ; and the journey J undertook for that purpose. To be acquainted with the particulars of my parentage and life, many of which are unknown to you, I flatter myself will afford the same pleasure toyou as tome. I shallrelate them upon paper : it will be an agreeable employment ofa week's uninterrupted leisure, which I promise myself during my present retirement in the country. There are also other motives which induce me to the undertaking.
