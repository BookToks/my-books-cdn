FRANKLIN.
 
 ing written an anonymous piece, I placed it at niglitunder the door of tlie printing-house, where it was found the next morning. My brother communicated it to his friends, when they came as usual to see him, who read it, commented upon it within my hearing, and I had the exquisite pleasure to find that it met with their approbation, and that in their various conjectures Â«;hey made respecting the author, no one was mentioned who did not enjoy a high reputation in the country for talents and genius. I now supposed myself fortunate in myjudges, and began to suspect that they were not such excellent writers as I had hitherto supposed them. Be this as it may, encouraged by this little adventure, I wrote and sent to press, in the same way, many other pieces, which were equally approved : keeping the secret till my slender stock ofinformation and knowledge for such performances was pretty completely exhausted, when I made myself known.
 
 My brother upon this discovery, began to entertain a little more respect for me ; but he still regarded himself as my master, and treated me as an apprentice. lie thought LIFE or DR.
