 excited tube under them, sparks might be drawn, and a light perceived at the extremities in the dark. M. du Feye, intendant of the French King's gardens, made a number of experiments, which added not a little to the science. He made the discovery of two ^inds of electricity, which he called vitreous tind resinous; the former produced by rub bing glass, the latter from excited sulphur, sealingwax, &c. Butthis idea he afterwards gave up as erroneous. Between the years 1739 and 1742, Desauguliersmade a number of experiments, but added little of importance. He first used the terms conductors and electrics per se. In 1742, several ingenious Germans engaged in this subject; of these the principal were, Professor Boze, of Wittemberg, Professor Winkler, of Leipsic, Gordon, a Scotch Benedictine monk, professorofphilosophy atErfurt, andDr.Ludolf, of Berlin. The result of their researches astonished the philosophers ofEurope. Their apparatus was large, and by means of it they were enabled to collect large quantities of the electric fluid, and thus to produce phenomena which had been hitherto unobserved.
