Only recently, Brother Lawrence was asked to go into Burgundy to get supplies for the monastery. This chore was difficult for him because, first, he had no head for business and, second, he was lame in one leg and could not walk on the boat without falling against the cargo of barrels. Nevertheless, neither his awkwardness nor the errand in general caused him any distress. He simply told God that it was His affair, after which he found that everything turned out nicely.
 
 Things went the same way in the kitchen of the monastery, where he worked. Although he once had a great dislike for kitchen work, he developed quite a facility for doing it over the fifteen years he was there. He attributed this to his doing everything for the love of God, asking as often as possible for grace to do his work. He said that he was presently in the shoe repair shop and that he liked it very much. He would, however, be willing to work anywhere, always rejoicing at being able to do little things for the love of God.
 
 Brother Lawrence was aware of his sins and was not at all surprised by them. “That is my nature,” he would say, “the only thing I know how to do.” He simply confessed his sins to God, without pleading with Him or making 18 The Practice of the Presence of God excuses.
