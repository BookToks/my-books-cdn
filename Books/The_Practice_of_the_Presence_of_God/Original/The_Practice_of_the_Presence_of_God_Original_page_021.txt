This was because his past experience of God’s faithful assistance allowed him to wait until just the right moment to call out. When the time came, he would address himself to God, and the evil thoughts would vanish right away.
 
 Because of this same trust in God’s care, when Brother Lawrence had some outside business to attend to, he never worried about it beforehand. Rather, he found God would give him a picture as clear as a mirror image of exactly what to do at precisely the right moment. He had acted in this way for quite some time, without being concerned about something ahead of time. Before he had experienced God’s swift help in his affairs, he had attempted to plan every detail, doing the job in his own strength. Now, though, acting with childlike simplicity in God’s sight, he did everything for the love of God, thanking Him for His guidance. Everything he did passed calmly, in a way that held him close to the loving presence of God.
 
 When any outside business unnecessarily diverted him from his communication with God, a little reminder came from the Lord that took possession of his soul, flooding it with the image of God. This sometimes set him on fire to the point that he felt a great impulse to 22 The Practice of the Presence of God shout praises, to sing, and to dance before the Lord with joy.
