And, far from destroying a soldierâ€™s courage, this will strengthen him.
 
 Tell him to dwell in God as much as possible, gradually getting used to this simple, but holy, exercise. No one will be able to see it. Besides, nothing is easier than praising the Lord.
 
 Tell him to do this as often as he can. It is quite acceptable behavior for a soldier; in fact, it is necessary for someone whose life (and salvation) are constantly in danger.
 
 I pray that God will help him and all of his family, whom I salute.
