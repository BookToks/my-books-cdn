Written over three hundred years ago, this message is relevant for every Christian who is caught up in the rush of today’s world.
 
 Each section, whether written by the author’s own hand or by his close friend, Joseph de Beaufort, reveals the inner secrets of Brother Lawrence’s heart—a heart that had learned the most essential ingredient of the Christian life: how to remain in the presence of God.
 
 In this abridged edition, we have sought to update and clarify the language of this Christian classic, paraphrasing where necessary, while keeping the essence of the message intact.
 
 We trust that Brother Lawrence’s lifelong endeavor to dwell completely in the presence of God will become a continual practice for all who read this book.
