We can begin all over again and repair the lost opportunity, returning with complete confidence to this kind Father, who is always ready to receive us lovingly. We need to abandon everything that isn’t of God. Doesn’t He deserve this and much more? Let’s think of Him continually, and put all our confidence in Him. Soon His abundant grace will engulf us. With it, we can do anything, but without it, we can commit only sin.
 
 We cannot avoid the dangers of life without God’s continual help, so we should ask Him for it ceaselessly.
 
 But how can we ask for help unless we are with Him? To be with Him, we must cultivate the holy habit of thinking of Him often.
 
 You will tell me that I always say the same thing. What can I say? It is true. I don’t know an easier method, nor do I practice any other, so I advise this one to everybody.
 
 We have to know someone before we can truly love him.
 
 In order to know God, we must think about Him often.
 
 Once we get to know Him, we will think about Him even more often, because where our treasure is, there also is our heart!
