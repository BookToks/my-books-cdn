Brother Lawrence insisted that, to be constantly aware of God’s presence, it is necessary to form the habit of continually talking with Him throughout each day.
 
 To think that we must abandon conversation with Him in order to deal with the world is erroneous. Instead, as we nourish our souls by seeing God in His exaltation, we will derive a great joy at being His.
 
 Another thing he mentioned was that our faith is too weak. Instead of letting faith rule our lives, we are guided by our petty, everyday, mechanical prayers, which are always changing. The church’s only road to the perfection of Christ is faith.
 
 The dear brother remarked that we must give ourselves totally to God in both temporal and spiritual affairs. Our only happiness should come from doing God’s will, whether it brings us some pain or great pleasure. After all, if we are truly devoted to doing God’s will, pain and pleasure won’t make any difference to us.
 
 We also need to be faithful, even in dry periods. It is during those dry spells that God tests our love for Him.
 
 We should take advantage of those times to practice our determination and our surrender to Him. This will 14 The Practice of the Presence of God often bring us to a maturity further on in our walk with God.
