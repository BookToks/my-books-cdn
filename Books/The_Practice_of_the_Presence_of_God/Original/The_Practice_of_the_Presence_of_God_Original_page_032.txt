32 The Practice of the Presence of God We often stop this torrent by our lack of respect for it. However, we mustn’t restrain it any longer. Let us go into our hearts, dear friend, breaking down the dike, making way for grace, and making up for lost time! You and I are getting along in years. We may have little time left to live. Death is always near, so be prepared, for we only die once.
 
 Once again, let us examine our inner selves. Time is pressing down on us, and each of us must be responsible for himself. I believe you have prepared yourself properly, so you won’t be taken by surprise. I respect you for this; it is, after all, our business to be as open as possible to God’s grace. However, we must continuously walk in God’s Spirit, since in the spirit-life not to advance is to fall back.
 
 Those who have the wind of the Holy Spirit in their souls glide ahead even while they sleep. If the vessel of our soul is still being tossed by winds or storms, we should wake the Lord who has been resting with us all along, and He will swiftly calm the sea.
 
 I have taken the liberty, my dear friend, of telling you all this so you might reexamine your own relationship with God. If by some means (I pray it is not so) it has cooled even slightly, perhaps our brother’s attitude will rekindle and inflame it. Do you remember our first First Letter 33 enthusiasm and love for God?
