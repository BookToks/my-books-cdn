Third Letter Dear friend, I’m amazed that you haven’t let me know your opinion of the book I sent you. You must have received it by now.
 
 Practice it energetically, even in your old age. It truly is better late than never.
 
 I honestly cannot understand how people who claim to love the Lord can be content without practicing His presence. My preference is to retire with Him to the deepest part of my soul as often as possible. When I am with Him there, nothing frightens me, but the slightest diversion away from Him is painful to me.
 
 Spending time in God’s presence doesn’t weaken the body. Leaving the seemingly innocent and permissible pleasures of the world for a time will, on the contrary, give us comfort. In fact, God won’t allow a soul that is searching for Him to be comforted anywhere other than with Him. Hence, it makes sense to sacrifice ourselves for some time in His presence.
 
 36 Third Letter 37 This does not mean that you have to suffer in this endeavor.
