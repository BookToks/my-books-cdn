The Life of Brother Lawrence 79 Filled with a divine zeal, Brother Lawrence sought God in the simplicity and the sincerity of his heart. Because his soul was weary of the painful life he had been leading up to that time in the world, he decided to retire to the desert. There, through his new Christian strength, he was able to get closer to God than he had ever been.
 
 However, such a solitary life is not good for young Christians, which our brother soon discovered. Seeing how joy and then sadness, peace and then anxiety, confidence and then heaviness took turns ruling his soul, Brother Lawrence began to doubt the wisdom of his decision to live in the desert, wishing instead to live within a Christian brotherhood. Life within such a group would be based on the firm rock of Jesus Christ rather than on the shifting sands of temporary, individual devotion. Also, the members of the group could edify and exhort one another, protecting themselves against the changeableness of their individual whims. Although the first step was difficult, he was lovingly persuaded by God to go to Paris, where he became a lay brother of the Carmelite Order and took the name of Brother Lawrence.
 
 From the very beginning, prayer was of particular importance to him. No matter how much work he had to do, he never cut his prayer time short. Recalling Godâ€™s 80 The Practice of the Presence of God presence and the love that resulted from it soon made him the model of his fellow members in the monastery.
