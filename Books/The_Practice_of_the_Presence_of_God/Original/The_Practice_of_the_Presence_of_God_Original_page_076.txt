Atruth that constantly recurs in Holy Scripture is that the arm of God is not shortened, since His mercy cannot be exhausted by our miseries. The power of His grace is no less great today than it was in the first days of the church. God desired to keep saints for Himself until the end of the world. These saints would pay Him a respect worthy of His grandeur and majesty and would be models of virtue because of the holy example they set.
 
 God was not content to have these extraordinary men born in the early centuries only. He still raises up people who perfectly fulfill these two duties of a saint and who guard the fruits of the Spirit in themselves, transmit them, and make them live again in others.
 
 Such a man was Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection, a Carmelite lay brother. God caused him to be born in 76 The Life of Brother Lawrence 77 these latter days to reverence Him and to provide an example of the faithful practice of all the virtues.
