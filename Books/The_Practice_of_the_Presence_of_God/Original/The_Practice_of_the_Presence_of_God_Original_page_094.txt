Believe me, and count for lost all the time that is not spent in loving God.” Since loving God and loving one’s neighbor are really the same thing, Brother Lawrence regarded those around him with the same affection he felt for the Lord.
 
 He believed that this was what Christ expressed in the gospel: that anything he did for even the humblest of his brothers would be counted as being done for Jesus. He was particularly careful to serve his brothers no matter what he was doing, and especially when he was working in the kitchen. There he treated them as if they were angels, a charity that he inspired in all those who succeeded him.
 
 He assisted the poor in their needs as much as was in his power. He consoled them when they had problems, offering them his advice. To sum this up in a few words, he did all the good he could for his neighbor and tried never to harm anyone. He did everything he possibly could to win men to God.
 
 Death did not frighten Brother Lawrence at all. On his deathbed, he displayed marks of a stability, a resignation, and a joy that were quite extraordinary. His hope became firmer and his love more ardent. If he had The Life of Brother Lawrence 95 loved God deeply during his life, he did not love Him any less at death.
