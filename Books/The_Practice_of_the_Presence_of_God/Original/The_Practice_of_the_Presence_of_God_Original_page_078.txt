God then allowed him to perceive the nothingness of the pleasures of the world and touched him with a love of heavenly things.
 
 Not realizing the fullness of God’s grace, Brother Lawrence did not permit that grace to alleviate his problems immediately. He struggled with serious concerns about his profession, the corruption of the world, man’s instability and infidelity, and the treason of enemies. The eternal truth of the Lord, however, finally allowed him to conquer those fears. He made a firm resolution to accept the teachings of the Gospel and walk in the footprints of Jesus Christ.
 
 This brought a new light to his countenance. It freed him from the difficulties that the devil and the world normally put in the path of those who wish to give their lives to the Lord. Our brother acquired a prudent firmness, which gave him such a strong determination to follow God that all his former difficulties were washed away in a moment, as if by a miracle. Meditating on the promises of the Lord and his love for Jesus Christ changed him into another man. The humility of the cross became more desirable to him than all the glory the world had to offer.
