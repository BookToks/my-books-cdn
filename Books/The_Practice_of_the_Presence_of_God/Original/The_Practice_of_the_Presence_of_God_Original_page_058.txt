These blessings, as great as they are, will never carry us as near to Him as a simple act of faith does in a time of need or trouble.
 
 Let us look to God with these eyes of faith. He is within us; we don’t need to seek Him elsewhere. We have only ourselves to blame if we turn from God, occupying ourselves instead with the trifles of life. In His patience, the Lord endures our weaknesses. Even so, just think of the price we pay by being separated from His presence!
 
 Once and for all, let us begin to be His entirely. May we banish from our hearts and souls all that does not reflect Jesus. Let’s ask Him for the grace to do this, so that He alone might rule in our hearts.
 
 I must confide in you, my dear friend, that I hope, in His grace, that I will see Him in a few days.
 
 Let’s pray to Him for one another.
 
 viv On February 12, 1691, just a few days after writing this letter, Brother Lawrence passed from this life into the next to dwell fully in the presence of his God.
