 Brother Lawrence saw nothing but the plan of God in everything that happened to him. Because he loved the will of the Lord so much, he was able to bring his own will into complete submission to it. This kept him in continuous peace. Even when told of some great evil in the world, He would simply raise his heart to God, trusting that He would work it to the good of the general order.

His views were not limited by time, because he contemplated nothing but the Eternal One and had become eternal like Him.
