His worldly name was Nicholas Herman. His parents, upright people who led exemplary lives, taught him in his childhood to love the Lord. They were particularly careful about his education, giving him only those lessons that were consistent with the Gospel.
 
 When he was a young man, he joined the armed services. Conducting himself with simplicity and honesty, he began to receive evidence from God of His goodness and His mercy.
 
 To begin with, he was taken prisoner by a small body of German troops and treated as a spy. Who can imagine how far his patience and calmness went during this disagreeable event?
 
 The Germans even threatened to hang him. He simply answered that he was not what they supposed, adding that, since he had never done anything to give him a bad conscience, death didn’t frighten him anyway. When the officers in charge heard this, they released him.
 
 Later, our young soldier was wounded, and his injury forced him to retire to the home of his parents, who were not far away. This gave him the opportunity to undertake a more holy profession—fighting under the banner of Jesus Christ. He resolved to give himself wholly to 78 The Practice of the Presence of God God and to repair his past conduct, not because of vanity, but through sentiments of true devotion.
