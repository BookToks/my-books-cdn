No, God must be served with holy freedom.
 
 We should labor faithfully, without distress or anxiety, calmly recalling our spirit to God whenever it is distracted.
 
 The only requirement is that we place our confidence entirely in God. Abandon any other concerns, including any special devotions you’ve undertaken simply as a means to an end. God is our “end.” If we are diligently practicing His presence, we shouldn’t need our former “means.” We can continue our exchange of love with Him by just remaining in His holy presence. Adore Him and praise Him! There are so many ways we can thank Him. The Holy Spirit dwelling in us leads us to love God in a diversity of ways.
 
 God be with all of you.
