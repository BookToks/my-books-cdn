This gave me such great respect for God that I was content with faith alone. I continued to pray this way, which gave me enormous peace and joy.
 
 During the first ten years, however, I worried that my walk with the Lord wasn’t good enough. Because I couldn’t forget my past sins, I felt very guilty when I thought of all the grace He had shown me. During that time, I used to fall often and then get up again. It seemed that everything—even God—was against me and that only faith was on my side. Sometimes I believed I felt this way because I was trying to show, at the beginning of my walk, the same maturity it had taken other Christians years to achieve. Sometimes it got so bad that I thought I was on my way to hell—willfully offending God—and that there was no salvation for me.
 
 Thankfully, these worries did not weaken my faith in God, but actually made it stronger. When I finally reached the point where I expected the rest of my life to be very difficult, I suddenly found myself wholly changed. My soul, which had always been troubled, finally came to rest in a profound inner peace.
 
 Since that time, I have been serving God simply, in humility and faith. Out of love, I try not to say, do, or 42 The Practice of the Presence of God think anything that might offend Him.
