Seek it, rather, because God wills it and out of love for Him.
 
 If I were a preacher, I would preach nothing but practicing the presence of God. If I were to be responsible for guiding souls in the right direction, I would urge everyone to be aware of God’s constant presence, if for no other reason than because His presence is a delight to our souls and spirits.
 
 It is, however, also necessary. If we only knew how much we need God’s grace, we would never lose touch with Him. Believe me. Make a commitment never to deliberately stray from Him, to live the rest of your life in His holy presence. Don’t do this in expectation of receiving heavenly comforts; simply do it out of love for Him.
 
 Put your hand to the task! If you do it right, you will soon see the results. I will support you with my prayers.
 
 Please keep me in your prayers, also, and in the prayers of your church.
