I tried to keep my heart in this father/child relationship as much as I could, adoring Him there. I held my spirit in His holy presence, recalling it whenever it went astray. This exercise was rather difficult. Yet, I was able to continue it without being disturbed when I was involuntarily distracted. It occupied as much time during my regular working day as it did in my prayer time. At all times—every hour and every minute—I drove everything out of my spirit that might take me from the thought of God.
 
 This has been my everyday routine since I began my walk with the Lord. Although sometimes I practice it timidly and with a great many mistakes, I am still quite blessed by it. This has to be due to the great goodness and mercy of God. We can indeed do nothing without Him (which is truer for me than for others). Yet, when we faithfully keep ourselves in His holy presence and always remember that He is before us, we avoid offending Him (at least voluntarily). Then we may take the holy liberty of asking Him for the grace we need. By continuing this practice of His presence, He becomes more familiar to us, and His presence becomes a natural thing.
 
 Thank God for His goodness to us!
