Eighth Letter Dear friend, You aren’t the only one to be distracted from the presence of God; I understand completely. Our minds are so flighty. However, remember that our God-given wills govern all of our strength. We must recall our minds to God. Otherwise, our spirits may wander, dragging us down to the things of this earth.
 
 I think the remedy for the problem is to confess our faults to God and humble ourselves before Him. It isn’t necessary to be too verbose in prayer, because lengthy prayers encourage wandering thoughts. Simply present yourself to God as if you were a poor man knocking on the door of a rich man, and fix your attention on His presence. If your mind wanders at times, don’t be upset, because being upset will only distract you more. Allow your will to recall your attention gently to God. Such perseverance will please Him.
 
 Another way to prevent the mind from wandering away from God during prayer is to train yourself to dwell 48 Eighth Letter 49 in His presence all day long.
