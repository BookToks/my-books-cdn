Even suffering will be easier when we are with Him, but without Him, even the greatest pleasures will be joyless. May He be blessed in everything!
 
 Gradually train yourself to show your love for Him by asking for His grace. Offer your heart to Him at every moment. Donâ€™t restrict your love of Him with rules or special devotions. Go out in faith, with love and humility.
 
 I remain your servant in the Lord.
