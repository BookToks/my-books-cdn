He will come and help you out of your problems at the right time, often when you donâ€™t expect it. Trust Him more than ever. Thank Him for giving you strength and patience, even while you are going through tough times, because this shows He cares about you. Keep yourself hopeful with His love and thank Him for everything.

I really respect your friend, the soldier, for being strong and brave. God has made him a good person, even though he is still a bit young and inexperienced. I hope the problems he faces will make him think more about his spiritual life.

Tell him to trust God completely, because God is always with him. He should talk to God all the time, especially when he is in the most danger.

Just turning his heart to God is enough. Even thinking about God for a moment or praising Him during battle makes God very happy.
