Everyone who believes the right way and is baptized has taken the first step toward becoming perfect. We will reach perfection if we follow the important rules of being a good Christian.

First, we need to think about God in everything we do and say. Our goal should be to worship Him perfectly while we live on earth, getting ready for forever life. We must decide strongly to overcome all the problems we face in our spiritual life with God’s help.

From the very start of our Christian journey, we should remember who we are and know that we don’t deserve to be called Christians except because of what Christ has done for us. God cleans us from all our mistakes and wants us to be humble. He often lets us go through hard times to help us become humble.
