All of us who believe as we should and are baptized have taken the first step toward perfection. We will attain perfection if we practice the following principles of Christian conduct.
 
 viv First of all, we need to be considerate of God in everything we do and say. Our goal should be to become perfect in our adoration of Him throughout this earthly life in preparation for all eternity. We must make a firm resolution to overcome, with Godâ€™s grace, all the difficulties encountered in a spiritual life.
 
 viv From the outset of our Christian walk, we should remember who we are and that we are unworthy of the name of Christian, except for what Christ has done for us. In cleansing us from all our impurities, God desires 60 Spiritual Maxims 61 to humble us and often allows us to go through a number of trials or difficulties to that end.
