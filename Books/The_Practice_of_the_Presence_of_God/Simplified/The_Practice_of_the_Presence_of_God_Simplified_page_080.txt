Even though he had the simplest jobs, he never complained. Jesus’ kindness helped him get through anything that was hard or boring.

He was very loyal to God. One time, a leader wrongly told him that some people wanted to kick him out of the monastery. He said, “I’m in God’s hands; He will do what’s best for me. If I can’t serve Him here, I’ll serve Him somewhere else.”

But as Brother Lawrence tried to live a more spiritual life, he kept thinking about the wrong things he had done before. He felt like a huge sinner who didn’t deserve God’s attention. This made him scared and worried for ten years, and he often doubted if he would be saved. He told God about his troubles, but he was also afraid of what it might cost to fully follow God, so he held back from fully trusting Him.

During this hard and dark time, Brother Lawrence didn’t feel much peace when he prayed, but he kept praying anyway. He trusted God and wanted more than anything to please Him.

Even when he thought about giving up, he found the strength and courage to keep going. At last, he prayed to God, “It doesn’t matter to me what I do or what I suffer, as long as I stay connected with Your will with love.”
