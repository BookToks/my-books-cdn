Fifth Letter

Dear Reverend, I really want to know what you think about my situation right now. A few days ago, I was talking to a friend about spiritual life. She said it is a life full of grace that starts with fear and respect like a servant, grows through hope for eternal life, and finally reaches fullness in pure love. She also said that different people feel this complete love more or less.

I haven’t followed any special steps to grow spiritually. Actually, I found following rules to be discouraging. At the start of my Christian journey, I wanted to give myself fully to God all at once.

I did this because I loved Him and wanted to make up for my sins and give up everything that upset Him.

My first prayers were about death, judgment, hell, heaven, and my sins. This went on for several years.

When I wasn’t praying, I tried to stay aware of God’s presence, even while working. I knew He was always close to me, deep in my heart.
