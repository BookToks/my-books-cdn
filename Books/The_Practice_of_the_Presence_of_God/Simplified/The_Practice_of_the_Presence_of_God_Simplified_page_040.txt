Fifth Letter Dear Reverend, I would like very much to know your opinion of my current situation. A few days ago, I was talking to a friend of mine about spiritual life. This friend described it as a life of grace, which begins with the fear and respect of a servant, growing through the hope of eternal life, finally to find fullness in pure love. She also said that different people experience this consummate love to greater and lesser degrees.

 I did this out of love for Him, because I wanted to pay for my sins and renounce everything that offended Him.

 When I wasn’t praying, I kept myself carefully in God’s presence, even while I was working. I knew He was 40 Fifth Letter 41 always near me, in the deepest part of my heart.
