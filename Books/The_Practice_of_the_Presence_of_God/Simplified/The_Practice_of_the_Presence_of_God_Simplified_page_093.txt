It is too much for me.

“If You want, please give these kinds of gifts and comforts to sinners and to people who don’t know You, so they will want to serve You. As for me, since I already have the happiness of knowing You by faith, I think that should be enough. But because I shouldn’t refuse anything from Your generous hand, I accept the gifts You give me, God. Still, please let me give them back to You just as You gave them to me. You know I don’t want Your gifts themselves, but You, and I can’t be happy with anything less.” 

These times of prayer made his heart burn with love even more, and sometimes he couldn’t hide it. People often saw his face shining, even though he didn’t want it to show.

Brother Lawrence felt sorry for the early years before he truly loved God. He told his brothers, “Oh goodness, so old and so new, I loved You too late!

“Don’t be like me, brothers. You are young; learn from my honest confession that I didn’t spend my early years giving myself to God.

Give all your years to His love. If I had known earlier, and if someone had told me what I’m telling you now, I wouldn’t have waited so long to love Him.
