A truth that shows up again and again in the Bible is that God’s power isn’t weaker, and His kindness never runs out, no matter how much we struggle. His grace is just as strong today as it was when the church first started. God wanted to have special people, called saints, with Him until the end of the world. These saints honor God’s greatness and show others how to live good lives.

God didn’t just want these amazing people to live a long time ago. He still chooses people now who do what saints do. They keep the good qualities from God inside them, share them with others, and help those qualities grow in other people.

One of these people was Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection, a Carmelite lay brother. God brought him into the world recently to honor Him and to be a good example of living with all the right virtues.
