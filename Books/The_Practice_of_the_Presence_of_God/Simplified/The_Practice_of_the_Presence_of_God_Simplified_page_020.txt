Third Conversation Brother Lawrence confided to me that the foundation of his spiritual life was the faith that revealed to him the exalted position of God. Once this became secure in the depths of his heart, he was easily able to do all his actions for the love of God. He truly understood that this solid faith in God was a great honor to Him and gave the Lord an open door to answer his prayers and shower blessings upon him.
 
 He continued that if someone surrenders himself entirely to God, resolving to do anything for Him, the Lord will protect that person from deception. He will also not allow such a person to suffer through trials for very long, but will give him a way of escape that he might endure it. (See 1 Corinthians 10:13.) Brother Lawrence’s heartfelt goal was to think of nothing but God. If he did allow some time to pass without thinking of Him, he did not grow upset about it. Once he confessed his weakness to God, he returned to Him with all the more confidence and joy because he had found himself so unhappy apart from God’s presence. If 20 Third Conversation 21 he felt any ungracious thought or any temptation generating, he would not panic or feel helpless to resist it.
