Brother Lawrence told me that the base of his spiritual life was the strong faith that showed him how important God really is. When this faith became deep in his heart, he could easily do everything out of love for God. He knew that having this strong faith was a big honor for God and it opened the door for God to answer his prayers and bless him.

He also said that if someone gives themselves fully to God and promises to do anything for Him, God will protect that person from being fooled. God won’t let them suffer too long in hard times but will help them find a way out so they can handle it. (See 1 Corinthians 10:13.) Brother Lawrence’s main goal was to think only about God. If sometimes he forgot and didn’t think about God for a while, he didn’t get upset. He would admit his weakness to God and then come back to Him with more trust and happiness because he felt sad when he was away from God.

If he had any bad or tempting thoughts, he wouldn’t panic or feel like he couldn’t stop them.
