He told me that God was especially kind to him when he became a Christian. He was eighteen years old and still living in the world. He said it all happened one winter day when he was looking at a tree with no leaves. Even though the tree looked dead, he knew the leaves would grow back soon, followed by flowers and then fruit. This made a strong impression on him about how God takes care of everything and is very powerful. This feeling stayed with him forever. Brother Lawrence still says that this feeling made him stop caring about the world and gave him a huge love for God that hasn’t changed in over forty years of following Him.

Brother Lawrence used to work as a servant for the monastery’s treasurer, and he was very clumsy.

He thought that because he was clumsy, he would have to be punished to be saved. So, he gave up all the fun things in his life for God. But instead of punishing him, God gave him complete happiness. He would often tell God that he felt tricked because his life as a Christian was so happy and not full of suffering like he expected.
