Actually, God often picks people who made big mistakes to show His biggest kindness, because it shows how good He really is.

Only Jesus’ blood can wash away our sins.

After that, whatever God wanted to happen to him, he didn’t worry about it. So, he didn’t stress about anything and only asked God not to let him upset Him.
