In his close relationship with the Lord, our brother’s strong feelings became so calm that he hardly noticed them anymore. He became kind, completely honest, and had the biggest heart full of love. His friendly face, warm and easygoing attitude, and simple, humble way of acting made everyone like and respect him right away. The more people got to know him, the more they saw how truly good and respectful he was.

Even though he lived a simple and ordinary life in the monastery, he didn’t act serious or sad, which can push people away. Instead, he hung out with everyone and treated his brothers like friends, without trying to be better than them. He never took God’s gifts for granted and never showed off his good qualities to get attention. He wanted to live quietly and unnoticed. Though he was very humble, he didn’t want people to notice his humility—he just wanted to really be humble. He wanted only God to see what he did and only God to reward him.

Even though he was naturally quiet, he had no problem sharing his thoughts to help his brothers. People noticed that he helped more those who were simple and less complicated in their faith, rather than those who thought they knew more.
