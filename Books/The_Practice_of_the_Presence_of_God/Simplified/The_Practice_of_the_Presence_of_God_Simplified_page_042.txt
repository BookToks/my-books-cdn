My only request is that He do whatever He pleases with me.
 
 I feel unable to express what is going on inside me right now. I’m not anxious about my purpose in life because I only want to do God’s will. I wouldn’t even lift a straw from the ground against His order or for any other motive than love for Him. Pure love of Him is all that keeps me going.
 
 I have given up all but my intercessory prayers to focus my attention on remaining in His holy presence. I keep my attention on God in a simple, loving way. This is my soul’s secret experience of the actual, unceasing presence of God. It gives me such contentment and joy that I sometimes feel compelled to do rather childish things to control it.
 
 To sum up, kind sir, I am sure my soul has been with God for more than thirty years. I consider God my King, against whom I’ve committed all sorts of crimes.
 
 Confessing my sins to Him and asking Him to forgive me, I place myself in His hands to do whatever He pleases with me.
 
 This King, who is full of goodness and mercy, doesn’t punish me. Rather, He embraces me lovingly and invites me to eat at His table. He serves me Himself and gives me the keys to His treasury, treating me as His favorite.
