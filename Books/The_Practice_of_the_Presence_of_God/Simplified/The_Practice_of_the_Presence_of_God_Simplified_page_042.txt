My only wish is that He does whatever He wants with me.

Right now, I can’t really explain what I’m feeling inside. I’m not worried about my purpose in life because I just want to do what God wants. I wouldn’t even pick up a straw from the ground unless He told me to, or unless I did it out of love for Him. Loving Him is the only thing that keeps me going.

I have stopped doing everything except praying for others so I can focus on staying close to God. I think about God in a simple and loving way. This is my soul’s secret way of feeling God’s constant presence. It makes me so happy and peaceful that sometimes I feel like doing silly things to try to control it.

To sum it up, kind sir, I believe my soul has been close to God for more than thirty years. I see God as my King, even though I have done many wrong things against Him.

I tell Him my sins and ask for His forgiveness, then I trust Him to do whatever He wants with me.

This King, who is full of kindness and mercy, doesn’t punish me. Instead, He hugs me with love and invites me to eat with Him. He serves me Himself and gives me the keys to His treasure, treating me like His favorite.
