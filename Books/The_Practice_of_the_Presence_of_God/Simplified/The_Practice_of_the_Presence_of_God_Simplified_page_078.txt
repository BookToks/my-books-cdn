God helped him see that the pleasures of the world don’t really matter and gave him a love for heavenly things.

At first, Brother Lawrence didn’t fully understand God’s grace, so it didn’t immediately solve his problems. He worried a lot about his job, the world’s corruption, people being untrustworthy, and enemies who betrayed him. But in the end, the eternal truth of the Lord helped him beat those fears. He decided firmly to follow the teachings of the Gospel and live like Jesus Christ.

This decision made him look different, like a new person. It freed him from the problems that usually stop people who want to give their lives to God. He became strong and determined to follow God, and all his old problems disappeared quickly, almost like a miracle. Thinking about God’s promises and his love for Jesus changed him completely. He began to value humility and the sacrifice of Jesus more than all the fame and glory the world could offer.
