After someone’s soul is saved, they start to get to know God through different experiences. Some of these experiences make the soul feel closer to God, while others make it feel farther away. The soul learns which actions help bring God’s presence closer and sticks to those actions to stay near Him.

The closest connection with God is actually feeling His presence. Even though this connection is spiritual, it is very lively because the soul is awake and full of energy. In this state, the soul feels more alive than fire and shines brighter than the sun, but it is also gentle and full of love.

This connection isn’t just about saying, “Lord, I love You,” or other words. It’s a deep feeling inside the soul that can’t be put into words. It’s calm, peaceful, respectful, humble, loving, and simple. It makes the person want to love God, worship Him, and hold Him with kindness and happiness.

Anyone trying to be close to God needs to understand that just because something feels good or fun doesn’t mean it will bring them closer to God.
