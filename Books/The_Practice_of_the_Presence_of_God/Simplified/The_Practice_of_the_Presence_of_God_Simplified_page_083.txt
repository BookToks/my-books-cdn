By thinking about Jesus Himself, I got to know this loving Person better and decided I always wanted to be close to Him.

I used to close myself in the kitchen, fully focused on understanding God’s greatness. After finishing all my work tasks, I spent the leftover time praying alone.

I prayed both at the start and the end of my work. At the beginning, I would say to God, “Since You are with me and want me to do these tasks, please help me stay close to You. Work with me so my work is the best it can be. I offer You my work and my feelings with love.”  

While working, I kept talking to God like He was right there with me. I gave Him my help and thanked Him for being with me. After finishing, I checked my work carefully. If it was good, I thanked God. If I saw mistakes, I asked for His forgiveness without feeling bad, then kept going while staying close to Him.

By always talking to God during the day and quickly asking for His forgiveness when I messed up, being close to Him has become as easy and natural as it was once hard to do.
