Our hope gets bigger and stronger, and the good things it expects to enjoy—and sometimes even feels a little—help keep it going.

The third good thing is that this habit makes the will happy to be different from the world, filling it with the fire of holy love. This happens because the soul is always with God, who is like a powerful fire that destroys anything against Him. The soul, now full of this fire, can’t live without being near God. Being with God creates a strong passion, a deep need, and a strong desire in the heart to see the God it loves so much.

By practicing being with God and always thinking about Him, the soul gets to know Him so well that it spends almost its whole life doing acts of love, praise, trust, thanks, giving, and asking. Sometimes, all these feelings come together in one nonstop action because the soul is always connected to God’s presence.
