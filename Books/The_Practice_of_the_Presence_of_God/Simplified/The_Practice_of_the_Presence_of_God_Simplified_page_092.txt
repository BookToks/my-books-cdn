He didn’t want anything; nothing surprised him; he wasn’t afraid of anything. This calmness in his heart came from the same place as all his other good qualities.

He had a high idea of God, thinking of Him as perfect Justice and endless Goodness. He believed God wouldn’t trick him and would only do good to him, because he decided never to upset God and to do everything out of love for Him.

He didn’t love God just because of the good things God gave him. He would have loved God even if there were no punishments to avoid or rewards to get. He only wanted God’s glory and to do what God wanted. This was very clear when he was very sick, because even until his last breath, his spirit was free and he felt the same as if he were completely healthy.

His love was so pure that he wished, if it were possible, that God couldn’t see what he did for Him. This was so he could act only for God’s glory and not for himself. But God never missed anything and always gave him back a hundred times more, often giving him feelings and experiences of God’s divinity that were so strong they overwhelmed him. Then he would shout to God: “It is too much, O Lord!”
