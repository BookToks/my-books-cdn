His real name was Nicholas Herman. His parents were good people who lived honest lives and taught him to love God when he was a child. They made sure he only learned things that agreed with the teachings of the Bible.

When he was a young man, he joined the army. He behaved simply and honestly, and he started to see signs from God that showed His kindness and mercy.

At first, he was captured by a small group of German soldiers who thought he was a spy. Imagine how patient and calm he had to be during this hard time.

The Germans even said they would hang him. He told them he wasn’t a spy and that he wasn’t scared to die because he had done nothing wrong. When the officers heard this, they let him go.

Later, he got hurt and had to go back to his parents’ home, which was nearby. This gave him the chance to choose a more holy path—serving Jesus Christ. He decided to dedicate himself fully to God and to fix his past mistakes, not to show off but because he truly wanted to.
