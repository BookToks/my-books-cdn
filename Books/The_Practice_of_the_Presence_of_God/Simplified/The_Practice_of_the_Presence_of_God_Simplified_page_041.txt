This made me respect God a lot, and I was happy to just have faith. I kept praying this way, and it brought me a lot of peace and happiness.

In the first ten years, I often worried that I wasn’t close enough to God. I couldn’t stop thinking about my past mistakes, and I felt really guilty because God had shown me so much kindness. During that time, I would mess up a lot but always try to get back up. It felt like everything—even God—was against me, and only my faith was on my side. Sometimes I thought I felt this way because I wanted to be as mature in my faith as other Christians who had been at it for years. Sometimes it got so bad that I thought I was going to hell because I was purposely upsetting God and that there was no way to be saved.

Luckily, these worries didn’t make me lose faith in God; they actually made my faith stronger. When I finally thought the rest of my life was going to be really hard, I suddenly felt completely changed. My soul, which had always been troubled, finally found deep peace inside.

Since then, I have been serving God simply, with humility and faith. Because I love Him, I try not to say, do, or even think anything that might upset Him.
