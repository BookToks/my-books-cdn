We could both learn from this. (People think Brother Lawrence was talking about himself here. He was too humble to say it directly.) For over forty years, this brother’s main goal has been to stay as close to God as he can. He tries not to do, say, or even think anything that might upset God. He does this only to thank God for His pure love because God deserves so much more than that.

This brother is so used to feeling God’s presence that he depends on it for help all the time. His soul is always filled with a deep happiness. Sometimes this joy is so strong that he feels like doing silly things to keep from feeling overwhelmed.

If he ever loses this feeling of God’s presence, God quickly brings him back by speaking to him through the Holy Spirit.
