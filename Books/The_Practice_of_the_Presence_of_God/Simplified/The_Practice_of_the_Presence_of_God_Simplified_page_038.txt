Fourth Letter

My dear sister in the Lord, I feel for the hard time you’re going through. I think the best thing for you is to take a break from your duties and focus completely on prayer for a while.

God doesn’t ask much from you. Just thinking about Him, praising Him, asking for His help, giving Him your problems, or thanking Him for what you have will comfort you all the time. When you eat or do something else, quietly lift your heart to Him, because even a small thought of Him makes Him happy. You don’t need to pray out loud; He is closer than you can imagine.

You don’t have to stay in church to be close to God. You can make your heart a special place where you can go anytime to talk to God alone. These talks can be loving and gentle, and anyone can do this.

So, why not start now? God might be waiting for you to take the first step. Since our time is short, we should spend the rest of it with God.
