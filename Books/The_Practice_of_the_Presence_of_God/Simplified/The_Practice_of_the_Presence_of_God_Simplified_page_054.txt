Eleventh Letter Dear friend, Since you are so seriously interested in knowing how I attained the ability God granted me to dwell in His presence, I will try to explain it. But I must ask you not to show my letter to anyone. If I thought you were going to let someone else read it, I would not discuss the matter, despite all of my desire for your spiritual growth.

What I wanted was simply to belong totally to God, so I decided to give everything I could give in order to attain the greatest blessing in returnâ€”knowing Him. I gave myself completely to God, accepting His forgiveness of my sins, after which I renounced everything that might offend Him. I began to live as if there were no one but God and myself in the world.
 
 Sometimes I thought of myself as a criminal standing before Him, my Judge; at other times I regarded Him as 54 Eleventh Letter 55 my Father.
