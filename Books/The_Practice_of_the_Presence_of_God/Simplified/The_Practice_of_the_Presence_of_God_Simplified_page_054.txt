Eleventh Letter

Dear friend,  

Since you really want to know how I got the ability God gave me to be close to Him, I will try to explain it. But please don’t show this letter to anyone. If I thought you would let others read it, I wouldn’t talk about it, even though I want you to grow spiritually.  

I found some books that talked about how to know God and grow spiritually, but I thought they would just confuse me. What I wanted was to fully belong to God, so I decided to give everything I could to get the best gift—knowing Him. I gave myself completely to God, accepted His forgiveness for my sins, and stopped doing anything that might upset Him. I started living like it was just God and me in the whole world.  

Sometimes I saw myself as a criminal standing before Him, my Judge; other times, I thought of Him as my Father.
