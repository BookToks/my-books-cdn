Brother Lawrence said that when we start following Jesus, we have to remember that before, we lived in the world and faced many problems, accidents, and bad feelings inside us. God will clean us up and make us humble to help us become more like Jesus. As we go through this cleaning process, we will get closer to God.

So, we should be happy even when things get hard and keep going as long as God wants us to. This is because only by going through tough times will our faith become stronger and more valuable than gold. (See 1 Peter 1:7; 4:19.)
