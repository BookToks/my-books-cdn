(See James 4:7.) Whatever we do, even if we are reading the Bible or praying, we should take a few minutes—whenever we can—to truly praise God from our hearts and enjoy being with Him quietly. Since we believe God is always with us, no matter what we are doing, why not stop for a bit to love Him, praise Him, ask Him for help, give Him our hearts, and say thank you?

What could make God happier than when we put aside our worries for a little while to worship Him inside ourselves? These short breaks help us get away from being selfish, which only happens when we focus on the world.

In simple words, the best way to show we’re loyal to God is by giving up our worldly thoughts many times a day just to spend a moment with Him.

This doesn’t mean we should ignore our everyday responsibilities forever; that’s not possible. We should be wise about it. But I think many people who follow the Spirit make a mistake by not taking these little breaks to praise God and find peace in His presence for a few minutes.

Our love for God should come from faith, believing that He really lives in our hearts and that He wants to be loved and served with true spirit and honesty.
