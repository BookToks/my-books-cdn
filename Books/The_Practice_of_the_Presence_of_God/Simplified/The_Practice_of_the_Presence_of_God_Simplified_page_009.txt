This message was written over three hundred years ago, but it still matters to every Christian living in today’s busy world.

Each part, whether written by Brother Lawrence himself or his close friend Joseph de Beaufort, shows the true feelings inside Brother Lawrence’s heart—a heart that learned the most important thing about being a Christian: how to always be aware of God’s presence.

In this shorter version, we have tried to make the language easier to understand by changing words when needed, but we kept the main message the same.

We hope that Brother Lawrence’s lifelong goal to live fully in God’s presence will become a habit for everyone who reads this book.
