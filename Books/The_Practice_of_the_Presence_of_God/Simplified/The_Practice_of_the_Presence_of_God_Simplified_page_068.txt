The Presence of God The presence of God is the concentration of the soul’s attention on God, remembering that He is always present.
 
 know a person who for forty years has practiced the presence of God, to which he gives several other names.
 
 Sometimes he calls it a simple act—a clear and distinct knowledge of God—and sometimes he calls it a vague view or a general, loving look at God—a remembrance of Him. He also refers to it as attention to God, silent communion with God, confidence in God, or the life and the peace of the soul. To sum up, this person has told me that all these descriptions of the presence of God are merely synonyms that signify the same thing, a reality that has become natural to him.
 
 My friend says that by dwelling in the presence of God he has established such a sweet communion with the Lord that His spirit abides, without much effort, in the restful peace of God. In this center of rest, he is filled with a faith that equips him to handle anything that comes into his life.
 
 68 The Presence of God 69 This is what he calls the “actual presence” of God, which includes any and all kinds of communion a person who still dwells on the earth can possibly have with God in heaven.
