The Presence of God means focusing your mind on God and remembering that He is always with you.

I know someone who has practiced this for forty years and calls it by many different names.

Sometimes he calls it a simple act—clearly knowing God is there. Other times, he calls it a soft, loving look at God or just remembering Him. He also talks about it as paying attention to God, quietly being with God, trusting God, or feeling peace in your soul. He says all these names mean the same thing, something natural to him now.

My friend says that by staying connected to God, he has built a close, peaceful relationship with Him. His spirit lives in this calm peace easily. In this peaceful place, he feels strong faith that helps him deal with anything in life.

He calls this the “actual presence” of God. It includes all the ways a person on earth can connect with God in heaven.
