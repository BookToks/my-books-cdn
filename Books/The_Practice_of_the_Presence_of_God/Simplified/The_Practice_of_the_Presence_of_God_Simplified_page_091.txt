The Life of Brother Lawrence 91 The love of God reigned so completely in Brother Lawrence’s heart that he turned all his affections toward this divine Beloved. Faith made him regard God as sovereign truth; hope made him think of Him as complete happiness; and love caused him to conceive of Him as the most perfect of all beings, as Perfection itself.
 
 Everything was the same to him—every place, every job. The good brother found God everywhere, as much while he was repairing shoes as while he was praying with the community. He was in no hurry to go on retreats because he found the same God to love and adore in his ordinary work as in the depth of the desert.
 
 Brother Lawrence’s only means of going to God was to do everything for the love of Him. He was thus indifferent about what he did. All that mattered was that he did it for God. It was He, and not the activity, that he considered. He knew that the more the thing he did was opposed to his natural inclination, the greater was the merit of his love in offering it to God. He knew that the pettiness of the deed would not diminish the worth of his offering, because God—needing nothing—considers in our works only the love that accompanies them.
 
 Another characteristic of Brother Lawrence was an extraordinary firmness, which in another walk of life would have been called fearlessness. It revealed a 92 The Practice of the Presence of God magnanimous soul, elevated above the fear and the hope of all that was not God.
