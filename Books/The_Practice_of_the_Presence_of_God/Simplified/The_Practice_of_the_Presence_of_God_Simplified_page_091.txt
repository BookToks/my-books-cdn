Brother Lawrence loved God so much that all his feelings were aimed at Him. His faith made him see God as the absolute truth; his hope made him think of God as pure happiness; and his love made him believe God was the most perfect being ever.

To Brother Lawrence, it didn’t matter where he was or what he was doing. He found God everywhere—whether he was fixing shoes or praying with others. He didn’t rush to go on special retreats because he found the same God to love in his everyday work as he would in a quiet, remote place.

The only way Brother Lawrence reached God was by doing everything out of love for Him. He didn’t care about the task itself. What mattered was that he did it for God. He thought about God, not the activity. He knew that when he did something he didn’t want to do, his love for God was even stronger. He also understood that small actions were still valuable if done with love, because God doesn’t need anything but cares about the love behind what we do.

Another thing about Brother Lawrence was his amazing strength, which in another life might be called bravery. It showed he had a great soul, one that was above fear and hope for anything except God.
