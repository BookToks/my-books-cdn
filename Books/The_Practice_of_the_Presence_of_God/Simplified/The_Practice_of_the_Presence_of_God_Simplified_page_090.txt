This shows that Brother Lawrence honestly understood his own weakness and truly believed in the power of God.

He saw God’s plan in everything that happened to him. Because he loved God’s will so much, he was able to accept it completely. This gave him constant peace. Even when he heard about something bad happening in the world, he would simply trust God to turn it into something good. When people asked him what he would choose if God let him live or die and go to heaven right away, Brother Lawrence said he would let God decide because he was just waiting for God’s will.

He didn’t care about his country like most people do. He was loved by people with many different opinions. He wanted good things for everyone, no matter who they were. He thought of himself as a citizen of heaven, not focused on things on earth. His thoughts were not limited by time because he only thought about God, who is eternal, and so he became eternal too.
