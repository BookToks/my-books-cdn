Brother Lawrence said that to always feel God near, we need to get used to talking to Him all day long.

It’s wrong to think we have to stop talking to God just because we’re dealing with life. When we remember how great God is, we feel happy to be close to Him.

He also said our faith is too weak. Instead of letting faith guide us, we just say quick, automatic prayers that change all the time. The only way to become more like Christ is through faith.

Brother Lawrence said we must give ourselves fully to God in everything, both in daily life and in our spirit. We should only be happy when we do what God wants, even if it causes us pain or pleasure. If we really love God, pain or pleasure won’t matter.

We need to stay faithful, even when we feel distant from God. Those hard times test how much we love Him.

We should use those moments to prove how determined we are and how much we trust Him. This will help us grow stronger in our faith later on.
