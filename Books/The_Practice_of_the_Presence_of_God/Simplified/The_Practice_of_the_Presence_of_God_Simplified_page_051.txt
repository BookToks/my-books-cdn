We can start fresh and fix the chance we missed by coming back to our kind Father, who is always ready to welcome us with love. We need to let go of everything that isn’t from God. Doesn’t He deserve that and even more? Let’s keep thinking about Him and trust Him completely. Soon, His great kindness will surround us. With His help, we can do anything, but without it, we only make mistakes.

Life is full of dangers we can’t avoid without God’s constant help, so we should ask Him for help all the time.

But how can we ask for help if we aren’t close to Him? To be close to Him, we need to get into the habit of thinking about Him often.

You might say I always say the same thing. What can I do? It’s true. I don’t know an easier way, and I don’t use any other method, so I tell everyone to try this one.

We have to know someone before we can really love them.

To know God, we must think about Him a lot.

Once we know Him, we will think about Him even more because where our treasure is, that’s where our heart is too!
