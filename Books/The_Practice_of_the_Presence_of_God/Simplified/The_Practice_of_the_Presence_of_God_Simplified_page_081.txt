This is exactly the attitude God wanted him to have before giving him His blessings. Our humble brother didn’t know how kind God is to people like him who make mistakes. He didn’t realize that God had already forgiven him.

But after that, his inner strength grew stronger than ever. God, who can do amazing things in an instant, suddenly helped Brother Lawrence understand how great God is. This made him feel peaceful, got rid of his fears, and stopped his inner pain and struggles.

From that moment, thinking about God’s character and kindness shaped Brother Lawrence’s personality. It became so natural to him that he spent the last forty years of his life always feeling God’s presence, which he described as a quiet, friendly conversation with God.

Brother Lawrence started this by creating a strong feeling of God being close in his heart. He said that feeling God’s presence comes from the heart and love, not from thinking or talking.

“In God’s way,” he said, “thoughts don’t matter much, love does everything. And you don’t need to do big things.”
