This happened because Brother Lawrence trusted that God would help him at the right time. When the moment came, he would talk to God, and the bad thoughts would disappear immediately.

Because he trusted God so much, when Brother Lawrence had something to do outside, he never worried about it before. Instead, he believed God would show him exactly what to do at just the right time. He had done this for a long time without stressing about the future. Before, he tried to plan everything by himself and do the job his own way. But now, he worked with simple faith, doing everything out of love for God and thanking Him for His help. Everything he did was calm and kept him close to God’s loving presence.

If something outside distracted him from talking to God, God would remind him gently. This reminder would fill his soul with God’s image. Sometimes, it made him so happy that he wanted to shout praises, sing, and dance with joy before the Lord.
