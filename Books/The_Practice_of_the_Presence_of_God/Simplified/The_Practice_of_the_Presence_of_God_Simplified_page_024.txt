Today, Brother Lawrence talked to me very openly and excitedly about how he connects with God. He said the most important thing is to completely give up anything that doesn’t help us get closer to God. This helps us have an easy and ongoing conversation with Him.

All we need to do is realize that God is very close to us inside. Then, we can talk to Him anytime we need help, want to understand what He wants, or want to do what pleases Him. We should offer our work to Him before we start and thank Him afterward for letting us do it for Him.

This ongoing talk with God should also include always praising and loving Him because He is so good and perfect.

Brother Lawrence said we should confidently ask God for His help in everything we do, trusting in Jesus’ great love and not just our own ideas.
