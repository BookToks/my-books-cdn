Fourth Conversation Today Brother Lawrence spoke to me quite openly and with great enthusiasm about his manner of going to God. He said the most important part resides in renouncing, once and for all, whatever does not lead to God. This allows us to become involved in a continuous conversation with Him in a simple and unhindered manner.
 
 All we have to do is to recognize God as being intimately present within us. Then we may speak directly to Him every time we need to ask for help, to know His will in moments of uncertainty, and to do whatever He wants us to do in a way that pleases Him. We should offer our work to Him before we begin and thank Him afterward for the privilege of having done it for His sake.
 
 This continuous conversation should also include praising and loving God incessantly for His infinite goodness and perfection.
 
 Brother Lawrence declared that we ought to ask confidently for Godâ€™s grace in everything we do, trusting the infinite merits of our Lord rather than our own 24 Fourth Conversaton 25 thoughts.
