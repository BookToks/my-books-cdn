I tried to keep my heart connected to God like a father and child as much as I could, loving Him in that way. I kept my spirit focused on His holy presence and brought it back whenever it wandered. This was pretty hard. But I managed to keep doing it even when I got distracted without meaning to. I did this as much during my regular workday as I did during my prayer time. Every hour and every minute, I pushed out any thoughts that might take me away from thinking about God.

This has been my daily habit since I started following the Lord. Sometimes I do it shyly and mess up a lot, but I still feel very blessed by it. This has to be because of God’s great kindness and mercy. We really can’t do anything without Him (this is especially true for me). But when we stay faithful and keep ourselves aware that He is always with us, we don’t hurt Him on purpose. Then we can freely ask Him for the help we need. By doing this over and over, God becomes more familiar to us, and feeling His presence becomes normal.

Thank God for being so good to us!
