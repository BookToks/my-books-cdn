Sixth Letter Dear sister, As I promised, I am praying for you, even though my prayers are meager. Wouldn’t we be happy if we could find the full treasure described in the Gospel? Nothing else matters. This treasure is infinite; the more we explore it, the more riches we find. May we never stop searching until we have found all of it!
 
 I don’t know what’s to become of me. It seems that a tranquil soul and a quiet spirit come to me even while I sleep. Because I am at rest, the trials of life bring me no suffering. I don’t know what God has in store for me, but I feel so serene that it doesn’t matter. What do I have to be afraid of when I’m with Him? I stay with Him as much as I can. May He be blessed for everything! Amen.
 
 45 Seventh Letter Dear friend, We have a God who is infinitely good and who knows what He is doing.
