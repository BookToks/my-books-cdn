Sixth Letter

Dear sister,  

As I promised, I am praying for you, even though my prayers might not be very strong. Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could find the full treasure talked about in the Gospel? Nothing else really matters. This treasure is endless; the more we look for it, the more we discover. I hope we never stop searching until we find it all!

I don’t know what will happen to me. It feels like a calm soul and peaceful spirit come to me, even when I sleep. Because I feel rested, the hard times in life don’t hurt me. I don’t know what God has planned for me, but I feel so calm that it doesn’t matter. What do I have to be scared of when I’m with Him? I try to stay close to Him as much as I can. May He be blessed for everything! Amen.

Dear friend,  

We have a God who is super good and who knows exactly what He’s doing.
