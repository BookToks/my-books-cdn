This will give you a kind of "practice" to help you remember to focus on Him. Staying close to Him during prayer time will get easier this way.

You already know from my other letters how helpful I think it is to practice being aware of God. Letâ€™s take loving God seriously and pray for each other.

I am still your brother in Christ.
