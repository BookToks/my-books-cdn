He talks to me without bringing up my mistakes or forgiving me. It’s like he has forgotten all my old bad habits. Even though I ask Him to do whatever He wants with me, He only shows me kindness. This is what it feels like to be close to Him.

Every day, I just try to give God my simple, loving attention. If I get distracted, He gently brings me back with a voice that sounds amazingly beautiful. If you think about me, please remember how much God has blessed me instead of how clumsy I usually am.

My prayers are just me continuing to do this. Sometimes I imagine I’m a piece of stone waiting for a sculptor. When I give myself to God like this, He starts shaping my soul to look like His beloved Son. Other times, I feel like my mind and heart are lifted up into God’s presence, like they naturally belong there without any effort.

Some people might think this is just me fooling myself. But I can’t accept that idea because all I want in this moment is to be with God. If I am fooling myself, I trust that God will fix it. I want Him to do whatever He wants with me; all I care about is being completely His.
