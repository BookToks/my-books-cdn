No, God should be served with free and pure heart.

We should work faithfully without stress or worry, and calmly bring our thoughts back to God whenever they get distracted.

The only thing needed is to trust God completely. Let go of other worries, even special prayers or actions you used to do just to reach a goal. God is the goal itself. If we are truly practicing being with Him, we donâ€™t need those old ways anymore. We can keep loving Him just by staying close to Him. Love and praise Him! There are many ways to thank Him. The Holy Spirit living inside us helps us love God in many different ways.

God be with all of you.
