God knows exactly what we need, and everything He does is for our own good. If we really understood how much He loves us, we would always be ready to face life—both the good times and the hard times.

Life’s problems don’t have to feel impossible. It all depends on how we see them—whether we believe in God or not. We need to be sure that our Father loves us a lot and only lets us go through tough times to help us grow.

Let’s spend our time trying to get to know God better. The more we learn about Him, the more we’ll want to know. As we understand Him more, our love for Him will grow too. We will learn to love Him just the same when we’re sad or when we’re super happy.

Even though we seek and love God because of the good things He has given us or might give us later, we shouldn’t stop there.
