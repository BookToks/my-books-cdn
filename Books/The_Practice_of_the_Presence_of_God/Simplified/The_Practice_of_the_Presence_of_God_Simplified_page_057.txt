God knows very well what we need and that all He does is for our good. If we knew how much He loves us, we would always be ready to face life—both its pleasures and its troubles.
 
 The difficulties of life do not have to be unbearable. It is the way we look at them—through faith or unbelief— that makes them seem so. We must be convinced that our Father is full of love for us and that He only permits trials to come our way for our own good.
 
 Let us occupy ourselves entirely in knowing God. The more we know Him, the more we will desire to know Him. As love increases with knowledge, the more we know God, the more we will truly love Him. We will learn to love Him equally in times of distress or in times of great joy.
