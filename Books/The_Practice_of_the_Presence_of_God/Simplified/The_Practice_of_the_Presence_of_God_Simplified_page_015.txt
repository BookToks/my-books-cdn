Brother Lawrence said he was always guided by love. He never cared about anything else, not even whether he was saved. He was happy doing the smallest task if he could do it just out of love for God. He even felt well off, which he thought was because he only looked for God, not for the things God gives. He believed God was much bigger than any gifts He gives us. Instead of wanting the gifts, he chose to focus on God Himself, hoping to learn more about Him. Sometimes, he even wished he could skip getting a reward so he could enjoy doing something only for God.

For some years, Brother Lawrence was worried because he wasnâ€™t sure if he was saved.

Still, he kept thinking that he became a Christian because he loved the Lord, and he would keep loving Him, whether he was sure of his salvation or not. That way, he could at least enjoy doing everything he could out of love for God.
