The quality he valued most—faith—became very strong in him, filling him with its greatness and lighting up his mind.

He was given some last quiet time to think about the amazing gift God had given him during his life.

When people asked how he spent that time, he said he was doing what he would do forever: "Blessing God, praising God, worshiping Him, and loving Him with all my heart. That is our whole purpose, friends, to worship God and love Him, without worrying about anything else."

The next day, February 12, 1691, without pain and still fully aware, Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection died peacefully in God's care. At eighty years old, he gave his soul back to God calmly, like someone falling asleep.

His death was like a gentle sleep that helped him move from this life to a better one.

It’s easy to believe that Brother Lawrence’s death was special to God, that he quickly received his reward, and that now he is enjoying glory. We also know that his faith has been rewarded with clear sight, his hopes fulfilled, and his growing love made perfect.
