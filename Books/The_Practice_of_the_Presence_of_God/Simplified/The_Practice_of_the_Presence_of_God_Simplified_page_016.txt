Later, Brother Lawrence stopped worrying about his relationship with God. After that, he didn’t think much about heaven or hell. Instead, he felt free and happy in his life.

He gave all his sins to God and told Him how unworthy he was of His kindness. But God still blessed him. Sometimes, God even showed him to the angels in heaven as someone special He was proud of.

At first, Brother Lawrence said it took a little effort to get used to always talking with God and telling Him everything. But after practicing, God’s love made it feel easy and refreshing.

Whenever he thought about doing something good, he would ask God for help, saying, "Lord, I can’t do this without You." Right away, he felt strong enough to do it.

When he sinned, he told God honestly, "I can’t do better without You. Please help me not to fall and fix my mistakes." After that, he didn’t feel bad or guilty.

Brother Lawrence said he talked to God very simply and honestly. He asked for help whenever he needed it, and God always answered him.
