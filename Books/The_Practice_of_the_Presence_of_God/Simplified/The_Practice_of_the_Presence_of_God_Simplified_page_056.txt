Twelfth Letter Hello friend!

Be brave! God sometimes lets us go through hard times to clean our hearts and teach us to trust Him more. (See 1 Peter 1:6–7.) So keep giving Him your problems and ask Him to help you get through them. Talk to Him a lot. Try not to forget about Him. Praise Him. When things are really tough, come to Him humbly and lovingly—like a child goes to a caring dad—and ask for the help you need from His kindness. I will pray for you too.

God has many ways to bring us closer to Him, but sometimes He seems far away. During those times, the only thing we can trust is our faith, which must be fully in God. That kind of faith will never fail.

Remember, God never leaves us unless we turn away first. We should be careful never to separate ourselves from Him. We must live with Him always; so let’s live with Him now and be with Him when our time comes. Pray for me, and I will pray for you.

I am yours in our Lord.

56 Thirteenth Letter Dear friend, I can’t thank God enough for how He has started to help you through your troubles.
