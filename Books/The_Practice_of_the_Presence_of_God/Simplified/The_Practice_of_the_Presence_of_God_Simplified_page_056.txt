Twelfth Letter Hello friend!
 
 Take courage! God often allows us to go through difficulties to purify our souls and to teach us to rely on Him more. (See 1 Peter 1:6–7.) So offer Him your problems unceasingly, and ask Him for the strength to overcome them. Talk to Him often. Forget Him as seldom as possible. Praise Him. When the difficulties are at their worst, go to Him humbly and lovingly—as a child goes to a loving father—and ask for the help you need from His grace. I will support you with my humble prayers.
 
 God has various ways of drawing us to Him, but sometimes He hides from us. In those times, the sole support of our confidence must be our faith, which must be totally in God. Such faith will not fail.
 
 Remember that God never leaves us unless we go away first. We should be careful never to separate ourselves from His presence. We must dwell with Him always; so let us live with Him now and die with Him when our time is at hand. Pray to Him for me, and I will for you.
 
 I remain yours in our Lord.
 
 56 Thirteenth Letter Dear friend, I cannot thank God enough for the way He has begun to deliver you from your trial.
