This often happens to him when he is busiest with his work. He responds faithfully to God’s calling, either by offering his heart to God, by a tender, loving look, or by some affectionate words, such as, “My God, I am all Yours; do what You will with me.” Then it is almost as if this God of love returns to his soul to rest again, satisfied with these few words.
 
 Experiencing these things makes this brother certain beyond all doubt that God is always in the depth of his soul, no matter what he does or what happens to him.
 
 Imagine what contentment and satisfaction he enjoys, possessing such an ever-present treasure! He isn’t anxious to find it and doesn’t worry about where to look for it, because he has already found it and may take whatever he wants from it.
 
 He often calls men blind, complaining that we are content with too little. God has infinite treasures to give us, he says. Why should we be satisfied with a brief moment of worship? With such meager devotion, we restrain the flow of God’s abundant grace. If God can find a soul filled with a lively faith, He pours His grace into it in a torrent that, having found an open channel, gushes out exuberantly.
