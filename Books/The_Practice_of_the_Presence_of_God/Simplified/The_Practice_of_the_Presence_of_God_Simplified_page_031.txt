This often happens to him when he is really busy with his work. He listens to God’s call by giving his heart to God, with a gentle, loving look or kind words like, “My God, I am all Yours; do what You want with me.” It feels like God’s love comes back to his soul to rest, happy with just these few words.

Because of this, he is completely sure that God is always deep inside his soul, no matter what he is doing or what happens to him.

Think about how happy and peaceful he feels, having this special treasure inside him all the time! He doesn’t worry about finding it because he already has it and can take anything he wants from it.

He often says that people are blind and complain that we are happy with too little. God has endless treasures to give us, he says. So why should we be okay with just a short moment of worship? When we only give a little devotion, we stop God’s grace from flowing freely. If God finds a soul full of strong faith, He pours His grace into it like a flood that bursts out happily through an open path.
