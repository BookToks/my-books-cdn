After this, he was able to calmly go back to his usual way of loving and worshiping God. If Brother Lawrence didn’t sin, he thanked God because only God’s help could keep him from doing wrong.

When he felt upset, he rarely asked anyone for advice. He just knew God was there, trusted Him, and felt happy to lose himself in God’s love no matter what happened. In God’s love, he would find himself again.

He said that thinking too much often ruins everything and that bad things usually start with our thoughts.

Brother Lawrence believed we should push away any thoughts that distract us from serving God or that make us doubt our salvation. Clearing the mind of these thoughts lets us have a calm talk with God, but he said this isn’t always easy.

When he first became a believer, he often spent his whole prayer time fighting distractions, only to get distracted again right away.

He said it’s important to know the difference between thoughts (intellect) and choices (will). Thoughts don’t matter much, but our choices matter a lot.

All we really need to do is love God and be happy in Him.

He said that no matter how many good things we do or how sorry we feel, they can’t erase even one sin.
