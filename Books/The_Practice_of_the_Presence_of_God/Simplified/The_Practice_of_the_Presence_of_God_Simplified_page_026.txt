When he wasn’t praying, he felt almost the same way.

He stayed close to God and praised Him with all his energy. Because of this, he was always happy.

Brother Lawrence said we need to trust God and give ourselves fully to Him. God won’t trick us. Don’t get tired of doing even small things for Him, because He cares more about the love behind what we do than how big the task is. It’s okay if we mess up at first.

If we keep practicing, doing these things will become easy and enjoyable, like a habit.

He said that to know if we’re doing God’s will, we just need to have faith, hope, and love. We don’t need to worry about anything else.

Other things don’t really matter. They are just ways to reach the main goal, which is to be completely lost in God’s love. We should want to love Him as perfectly as we can, both now and forever.

A person with hope can do many things.

A person with faith can do even more.

A person who knows how to love can do even more than that.

But a person who has all three—faith, hope, and love—can do anything.
