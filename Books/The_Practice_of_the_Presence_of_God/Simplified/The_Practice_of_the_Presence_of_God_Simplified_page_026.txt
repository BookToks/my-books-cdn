When he wasn’t in prayer, he felt practically the same way.
 
 Remaining near to God, he praised and blessed Him with all his strength. Because of this, his life was full of continual joy.
 
 We must, Brother Lawrence remarked, trust in God and surrender completely to Him. He will not deceive us. Never tire of doing even the smallest things for Him, because He isn’t impressed so much with the dimensions of our work as with the love in which it is done. We should not be discouraged if we fail in the beginning.
 
 This practice will eventually cause our efforts to become a pleasurable habit that we can do without thinking.
 
 He said that in order to be sure we are doing God’s will, we should simply develop an attitude of faith, hope, and love. We need not be concerned about anything else.
 
 It simply is not important and should only be regarded as the means of getting to the final goal of being entirely lost in the love of God. We should desire to love Him as perfectly as we can, in this life as well as in eternity.
 
 Many things are possible for the person who has hope.
 
 Even more is possible for the person who has faith. Still more is possible for the person who knows how to love.
 
 But everything is possible for the person who practices all three virtues.
