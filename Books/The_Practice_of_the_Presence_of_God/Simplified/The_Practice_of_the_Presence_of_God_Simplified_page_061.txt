We have to be sure that giving ourselves up for God is something He likes and is good for us. If we don’t fully agree in our hearts and minds to follow His plan, He can’t help us become perfect.

The more we want to be perfect, the more we need God’s help. We start to need His help with every little thing all the time because without Him, we can’t do anything. The world, our own desires, and evil forces are always trying to hurt our souls.

If we didn’t learn to depend on God in a humble way, our souls would suffer. Even though it can be hard for us to rely on God like this, He is very happy when we do. Learning to trust Him will give us peace.
