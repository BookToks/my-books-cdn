So, the main thing we need to do is focus our heart on God.

At the start, it’s okay to say short, loving phrases like “Lord, I am all Yours,” “God of love, I love You with all my heart,” or “Lord, use me the way You want.” But make sure your mind doesn’t start wandering or thinking about other things. Try to keep your attention only on God by choosing to stay in His presence.

At first, this might be hard to do, but if you keep practicing, it has amazing effects on your soul. It brings God’s blessings in a big way and helps you see God everywhere with a pure and loving heart. This is the best, strongest, easiest, and most powerful way to pray.
