We need to understand that He is the one who doesn’t depend on anyone, but we all depend on Him, and He knows everything that happens to us.

The Lord is perfect in every way, beyond what we can measure. Because He is the Creator and Savior, He has the right to have us and everything in heaven and on earth. It should make Him happy to do whatever He wants with us forever. Since He means so much to us, we should give Him our thoughts, words, and actions. Let’s try hard to do this.

We should look closely at ourselves to see which good qualities we need most and which ones are hardest to get. We should also notice the sins we often do and what situations make us fall into them. When we struggle, we can go to God with full trust and stay close to Him. We must honestly tell Him our sins and weaknesses, asking Him kindly for His help. Then, we will be able to have all the good qualities He has, even if we don’t have any on our own.
