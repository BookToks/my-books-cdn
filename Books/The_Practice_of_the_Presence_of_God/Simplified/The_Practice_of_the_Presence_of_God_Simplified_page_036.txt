Third Letter

Dear friend, I’m surprised you haven’t told me what you think about the book I sent you. You must have gotten it by now.

Keep practicing it with energy, even when you get older. It’s really better to start late than never.

I honestly don’t get how people who say they love the Lord can be okay without spending time with Him. I like to be with Him deep inside my soul as often as I can. When I’m with Him there, nothing scares me, but even a small distraction from Him hurts me.

Spending time with God doesn’t make your body weak. Giving up some fun things in the world for a while actually makes us feel better. God won’t let someone who’s looking for Him feel happy anywhere else but with Him. So, it’s smart to give up some things to be with Him.

This doesn’t mean you have to suffer while doing this.
