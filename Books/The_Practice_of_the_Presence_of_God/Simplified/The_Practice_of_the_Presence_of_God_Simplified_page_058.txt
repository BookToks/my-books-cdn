These blessings are amazing, but they don’t bring us closer to God like a simple act of faith does when we’re in trouble or need help.

Let’s look to God with faith. He is inside us; we don’t have to look for Him somewhere else. If we turn away from God and focus on small, unimportant things, it’s our own fault. God is patient and puts up with our weaknesses. Still, think about how much we lose when we feel far from Him!

Let’s decide to be fully His. We should get rid of anything in our hearts and minds that doesn’t show Jesus. Let’s ask God to help us do this, so He can be the one in charge of our hearts.

I want to tell you, my dear friend, that I hope, with God’s help, to see Him soon.

Let’s pray for each other.

On February 12, 1691, just a few days after writing this letter, Brother Lawrence died and went to live with God forever.
