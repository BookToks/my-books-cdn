He said that God will never stop giving us His help, and he knew this from his own experience.

This brother in the Lord only made mistakes when he stayed away from God or forgot to ask Him for help.

When we're unsure, he said, God always helps us find the right path, as long as we just want to make Him happy and show our love for Him.

He thought it was sad that some people chased after certain activities (which they didn’t do perfectly because they’re only human), mixing up what really matters. He said that becoming holy depends less on changing what we do and more on doing things for God instead of for ourselves.

Brother Lawrence’s best way to talk with God was by simply doing his regular work. He did it with obedience and true love for God, trying his best to keep it pure. He believed it was wrong to think prayer time is different from everything else. Our actions should connect us with God just like our prayers do during quiet times.

He said his prayers were just about being aware of God’s presence. His soul was resting in God, focused only on loving Him.
