When he found such Christians, he shared everything he knew with them. With wonderful simplicity, Brother Lawrence disclosed to them the fairest secrets of the spiritual life and the treasures of divine wisdom.
 
 The sweetness that accompanied his words so inspired those who listened that they came away penetrated with the love of God, burning with the desire to put the great truths he had just taught them into practice.
 
 Because God led Brother Lawrence more by love than by the fear of His judgment, his conversation tended to inspire the same kind of love. He encouraged other Christians to rely on God’s love to lead them in their spiritual lives, rather than the knowledge of learned men. He used to tell his brothers, “It is the Creator who teaches truth, who in one moment instructs the heart of the humble and makes him understand more about the mysteries of our faith and even about Himself than if he had studied them for a long term of years.” It was for this reason that he carefully avoided answering those curious questions that lead nowhere and that serve only to burden the spirit and dry up the heart. However, when he was required by his superiors to declare his thoughts on the difficult questions that The Life of Brother Lawrence 87 were proposed in conferences, his answers were always so clear and to the point that they needed no further comment.
