When he met other Christians, he shared everything he knew with them. Brother Lawrence talked about the most beautiful secrets of spiritual life and the amazing wisdom from God in a simple way.

The kindness in his words made people feel very inspired. They left feeling full of God’s love and excited to try out the important truths he had just taught them.

God guided Brother Lawrence more with love than fear of punishment, so his talks helped others feel the same kind of love. He told other Christians to trust God’s love to guide them in their faith, instead of just relying on what smart people say. He used to say, “It is the Creator who teaches truth. In just one moment, He can help a humble heart understand more about our faith and Himself than years of studying could.”

Because of this, he avoided answering tricky questions that didn’t help and only made people feel confused or tired. But when his leaders asked him to share his thoughts on hard questions during meetings, his answers were always clear and right to the point, so no one needed anything else explained.
