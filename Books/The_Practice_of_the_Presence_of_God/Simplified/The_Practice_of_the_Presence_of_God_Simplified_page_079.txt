Brother Lawrence was full of a strong love for God. He looked for God with a simple and honest heart. His soul was tired from the hard life he had before, so he decided to go live alone in the desert. There, with new Christian strength, he got closer to God than ever before.

But living alone like that is not good for young Christians, and Brother Lawrence soon saw this. He felt happy one moment, then sad the next. Sometimes he was calm, then worried. He started to wonder if living alone in the desert was a good idea. He wished he could live with other Christians. Living in a group would be stronger because it is based on Jesus, not on changing feelings. The group members could help and encourage each other. Even though it was hard at first, God gently guided him to go to Paris. There, he joined the Carmelite Order as a lay brother and took the name Brother Lawrence.

From the start, prayer was very important to him. No matter how busy he was, he never made his prayer time shorter. Thinking about Godâ€™s presence and love soon made him an example to others in the monastery.
