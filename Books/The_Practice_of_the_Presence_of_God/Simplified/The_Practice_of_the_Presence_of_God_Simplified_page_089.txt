This same faith made him really respect and love the Word of God. Our brother thought that even the smartest schools didn’t teach as much as God’s great Book.

He believed so strongly in what faith taught that he often said nothing he read or heard about God in the world could satisfy him. Lawrence said, “Because God is perfect and infinite, He can’t really be described. No human words are good enough to fully explain how amazing He is. Only faith helps me truly know Him. With faith, I understand more about Him quickly than I would in many years at school.”

Faith gave Brother Lawrence strong hope in God’s goodness, trust in His care, and the ability to completely trust God. He never worried about what would happen to him; instead, he gave himself fully to God’s mercy. The harder things got, the more he hoped—like a rock hit by ocean waves but staying steady in the storm.

This is why he said the best way to honor God is to stop trusting your own strength and rely completely on God’s protection.
