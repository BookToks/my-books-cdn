This same faith gave him a profound respect and love for the Word of God. Our brother believed that the books of even the most famous academies taught very little in comparison with God’s great Book. With such conviction did he believe the faith-taught truth that he often used to say nothing he could read or hear in the world about God could satisfy him. Lawrence declared, “Because God’s perfection is infinite, He is consequently indescribable; no words of man are eloquent enough to give a complete description of His grandeur. It is only faith that makes me know Him as He is. By means of it, I learn more about Him in a short time than I would learn in many years in the schools.” Faith gave Brother Lawrence a firm hope in God’s goodness, confidence in His providence, and the ability to completely abandon himself into God’s hands. He never worried about what would become of him; rather, he threw himself into the arms of infinite mercy. The more desperate things appeared to him, the more he hoped—like a rock beaten by the waves of the sea and yet settling itself more firmly in the midst of the tempest. This is why he said that the greatest glory one can give to God is to entirely mistrust one’s own strength, 90 The Practice of the Presence of God relying completely on God’s protection.
