Brother Lawrence said he felt much closer to God in his everyday life than most people thought was possible.

The worst thing he could imagine was losing the feeling that God was always with him. But because he trusted that God is good, he was sure God would never leave him completely. If he faced any big problems, he believed God would give him the strength to get through them.

Because of this trust, Brother Lawrence wasn’t afraid of anything. He said he wasn’t scared to give up his own wants or lose himself in Christ, because fully following God’s plan is the safest way to live. It always gives enough guidance to keep going safely.

At first, you need to be faithful by doing the right things and giving up selfishness. After that, you will feel a happiness that’s hard to describe. If problems come up, just turn to Jesus and ask for His help, and everything will feel easier.

Brother Lawrence also noticed that some people only do their regular prayers but forget about love, which is the real point of those prayers. You can see this in how they act and why they don’t have strong goodness inside.
