Brother Lawrence wasn’t surprised by the amount of sin and unhappiness in the world. Rather, he wondered why there wasn’t more, considering the extremes to which the enemy is capable of going. He said he prayed about it, but because he knew God could rectify the situation in a moment if He willed it, he didn’t allow himself to become greatly concerned.
 
 To succeed in giving ourselves to God as much as He desires, we must constantly guard our souls. In addition to being involved in spiritual matters, the soul is involved in the things of this world. However, when we turn our backs on Him, exposing our souls to the world, He will not so easily answer our call. When we are willing to accept God’s help and guard our souls according to His desires, we may commune with Him whenever we like.
