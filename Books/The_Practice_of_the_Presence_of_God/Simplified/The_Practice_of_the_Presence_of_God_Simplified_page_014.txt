Brother Lawrence wasn’t surprised by how much sin and unhappiness there is in the world. Instead, he wondered why there wasn’t even more, since the enemy can do really bad things. He said he prayed about it, but because he knew God could fix everything quickly if He wanted to, he didn’t worry too much.

To give ourselves to God the way He wants, we have to protect our souls all the time. Our souls are connected not only to spiritual things but also to the world around us. But when we turn away from God and let the world take over our souls, it’s harder for Him to hear us.

When we’re ready to accept God’s help and take care of our souls like He wants, we can connect with Him anytime we want.
