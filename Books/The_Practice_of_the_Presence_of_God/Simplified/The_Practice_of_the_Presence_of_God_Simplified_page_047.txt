Instead of making a soldier less brave, this will actually make him stronger.

Tell him to think about God as much as he can, slowly getting used to this simple but special habit. No one will notice it. Also, there’s nothing easier than praising the Lord.

Tell him to do this as often as possible. It’s totally okay for a soldier; actually, it’s important for someone whose life and soul are always at risk.

I hope God helps him and his whole family, who I send my greetings to.
