Look for God because He wants you to and because you love Him.

If I were a preacher, I would only talk about being aware of God all the time. If I had to help people find the right path, I would tell everyone to remember that God is always with them. His presence makes our hearts and spirits happy.

It’s really important, too. If we understood how much we need God’s help, we would never want to be far from Him. Trust me. Promise yourself to never turn away from Him on purpose and to live with Him always. Don’t do this just to get rewards in heaven; do it because you love Him.

Start now! If you do it the right way, you will soon see the good changes. I will pray for you to succeed.

Please pray for me too, and ask your church to pray for me as well.
