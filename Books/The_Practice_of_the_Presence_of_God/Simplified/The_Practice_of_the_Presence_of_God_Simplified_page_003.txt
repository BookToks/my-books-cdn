Foreword  

When I first became a believer, I read The Practice of the Presence of God and realized I wanted what Brother Lawrence had found. But I didn’t have the discipline and quickly stopped trying so hard.  

Years later, when my hair turned gray, I found this amazing little book again. Now, practicing God’s presence is my biggest passion. I believe that as believers, our purpose is to live in God’s love all the time. Everything I do now, no matter how small, is out of love for God and for others.  

When we get to heaven, the love we shared on earth will be what we leave behind.  

My friend Rick Joyner once dreamed he visited heaven for eight hours. Jesus told him why he was allowed to come. Jesus said, “You have found the key to true joy.” Rick asked, “What is the key?” Jesus answered, “It’s when you focus on making Me happy instead of just yourself.” Rick said he felt a joy he had never felt before.
