Foreword As a new believer, I read The Practice of the Presence of God and realized I wanted and needed what Brother Lawrence had discovered. But I lacked discipline and quickly gave up my all-out pursuit.
 
 When I had a head of gray hair, this amazing little book came to my attention again. Practicing God’s presence is now my magnificent obsession. I am convinced that our purpose as believers is to learn to walk in His love 24/7. Everything I do now, no matter how insignificant, is for the love of God and for the love of people.
 
 When we get to heaven, the love we deposited on earth will be our legacy.
 
 My friend Rick Joyner recently visited heaven in a dream that lasted eight hours. Jesus told him why he was granted this visitation. He told Rick, “You have used the key to eternal joy.” Rick asked Him, “What is the key?” and Jesus answered, “When you set your heart to bring Me pleasure above seeking your own.” Rick told me he experienced a level of joy beyond anything he had ever known.
