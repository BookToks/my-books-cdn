The Blessings of the Presence of God

The first blessing you get from practicing the presence of God is that your faith becomes stronger and more active in your life. This is especially true during hard times because it helps you get the strength you need to resist temptation and live well in the world. When you get used to having faith like this, you can actually feel and see God just by being close to Him. You can easily call on Him and get what you need. It’s almost like you move beyond just believing—you actually experience Him. This kind of faith grows deeper the more you practice it.

Second, practicing the presence of God also makes your hope stronger. As your faith grows, you start to understand God’s mysteries better through this practice. You discover that God’s beauty is way beyond anything you see on earth, even more amazing than the angels.
