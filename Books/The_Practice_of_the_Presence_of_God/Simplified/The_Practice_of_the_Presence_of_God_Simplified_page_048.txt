Eighth Letter

Dear friend, you’re not the only one who gets distracted when trying to feel close to God; I get it. Our minds jump around a lot. But remember, the will God gave us controls all our strength. We need to bring our thoughts back to God. If we don’t, our spirits might drift away and get caught up in worldly things.

I think the best way to fix this is to admit our mistakes to God and be humble before Him. You don’t need to say a lot in your prayers because long prayers can make your mind wander even more. Just come to God like a poor person knocking on a rich person’s door, and focus on Him. If your mind does wander sometimes, don’t get upset—that will only make it worse. Gently use your will to bring your attention back to God. This kind of patience will make Him happy.

Another way to stop your mind from drifting during prayer is to practice staying aware of God’s presence all day long.
