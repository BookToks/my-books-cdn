Tenth Letter

Dear Madame,

I wasn’t sure if I should write to our brother in the Lord. I’m only doing it because you asked me to. Would you please write the address and send the letter yourself?

Your trust in God is amazing; I hope He blesses you for it. We can never trust our Friend too much.

He is so good and always faithful. He will never let us down, now or later.

I pray that our brother is smart enough to learn from his loss and trust God fully. Maybe God will give him a new friend who is stronger and kinder. After all, God guides our hearts as He wants.

Maybe there was too much of the world in his love.

He might have cared too much about the one he lost. Even though we should love our friends, our love for God must always come first.

Remember what I told you: Think about God as much as you can, all day and night, in everything you do.
