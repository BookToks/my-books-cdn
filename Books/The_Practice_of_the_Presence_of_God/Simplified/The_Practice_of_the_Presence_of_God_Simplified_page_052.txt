Tenth Letter Dear Madame, It was difficult for me to decide whether or not to write to our brother in the Lord. I do so only because you wish it. Would you mind addressing and sending the letter yourself?
 
 Your confidence in God is beautiful; may He bless you for it. We can never trust this Friend of ours too much.
 
 He is so good and so faithful never to fail us, either in this world or in the next.
 
 I pray that our brother is wise enough to profit from his loss and to trust God completely. Perhaps our Lord will give him another friend who is more powerful and better disposed. After all, God deals with our hearts according to His will.
 
 There may have been too much of the world in his love.
 
 He may have been too attached to the one he lost. Even though we should love our friends, that love shouldnâ€™t hinder our love of God, who must be first.
 
 52 Tenth Letter 53 Remember what I advised you to do: Think about God as often as you can, day and night, in everything you do.
