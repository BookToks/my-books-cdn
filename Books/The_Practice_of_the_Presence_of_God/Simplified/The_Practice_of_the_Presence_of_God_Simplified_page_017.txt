Not long ago, Brother Lawrence was asked to go to Burgundy to get supplies for the monastery. This job was hard for him because, first, he wasn’t good at business, and second, he had a lame leg and could barely walk on the boat without bumping into barrels. But none of this bothered him. He just told God it was His problem, and everything worked out fine.

The same thing happened in the monastery kitchen, where he worked. At first, he really didn’t like kitchen work, but after fifteen years, he got pretty good at it. He said this was because he did everything for the love of God and asked God often to help him do his work well. He also said he was now working in the shoe repair shop and liked it a lot. Still, he was happy to work anywhere, always glad to do small jobs for God's love.

Brother Lawrence knew he made mistakes and wasn’t surprised by them. “That’s just who I am,” he would say. He simply told God about his sins without making excuses or asking for special treatment.
