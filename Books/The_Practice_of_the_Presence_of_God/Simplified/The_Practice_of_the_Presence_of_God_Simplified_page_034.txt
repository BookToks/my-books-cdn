Second Letter My dear friend, Today I received two books and a letter from a mutual friend who is preparing to commit her whole life in service to the Lord. She has asked for both of our prayers as she makes her firm resolution to live her life for Him.
 
 I am sending you one of the books, which discusses the importance of God’s presence, so you know that it is close to my heart.
 
 I still believe that all spiritual life consists of practicing God’s presence and that anyone who practices it correctly will soon attain spiritual fulfillment.
 
 To accomplish this, it is necessary for the heart to be emptied of everything that would offend God. He wants to possess our hearts completely. Before any work can be done in our souls, God must be totally in control.
 
 There is no sweeter manner of living in the world than continuous communion with God. Only those who have experienced it can understand. However, I don’t advise you to practice it for the sole purpose of gaining 34 Second Letter 35 consolation for your problems.
