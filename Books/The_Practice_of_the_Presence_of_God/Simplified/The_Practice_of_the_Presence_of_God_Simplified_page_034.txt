Second Letter

My dear friend,

Today I got two books and a letter from a friend we both know. She is getting ready to spend her whole life serving the Lord. She asked us both to pray for her as she decides to live for Him.

I am sending you one of the books because it talks about how important God’s presence is, and it means a lot to me.

I still believe that spiritual life is all about practicing God’s presence, and anyone who does this well will soon feel spiritually complete.

To do this, our hearts need to be emptied of anything that would upset God. He wants to have full control of our hearts. Before God can work in us, He must be in charge.

There is no better way to live than to always be connected with God. Only people who have felt this understand it. But I don’t think you should do it just to feel better about your problems.
