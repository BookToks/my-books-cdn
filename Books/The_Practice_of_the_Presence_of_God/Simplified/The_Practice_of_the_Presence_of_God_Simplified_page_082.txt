I turn my little omelet in the pan with all my heart. When it’s done, if I don’t have anything else to do, I lie down on the floor and worship God, who helped me make it. After that, I get up feeling happier than a king. When I can’t do anything else, just picking up a straw from the ground for God’s love is enough for me.

People try to find ways to learn how to love God.

They hope to do this by trying many different things. They work hard to stay close to God in lots of ways. But isn’t it easier and faster to just do everything for the love of God? We can use everything we do in life to show Him that love and keep Him close in our hearts.

It’s not complicated; you just have to do it with kindness and simply. When one of the brothers kept asking Brother Lawrence how he practiced being close to God, he answered simply: “When I first came to the monastery, I thought of God as the start and end of all my thoughts and feelings. During prayer time, I thought about the truth about God that we believe by faith, instead of spending time on hard meditations and reading.”
