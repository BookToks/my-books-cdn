Important Habits for Your Spiritual Life

The most important thing in your spiritual life is to always feel God’s presence. This means enjoying being with God all the time, talking to Him kindly and honestly whenever you want, without holding back.

This is really important especially when you feel tempted, sad, far from God, or when you make mistakes and sin.

Try to talk to God in small ways while you’re doing your daily tasks. Don’t just say prayers you’ve memorized or repeat things you’ve heard before. Instead, share what’s really in your heart as the words come naturally.

Do everything carefully, avoiding rushing or acting without thinking, because that shows your spirit is not in order. God wants you to work gently, calmly, and with love, asking Him to bless what you do. By always paying attention to God like this, you can fight off bad thoughts and make the devil go away.
