Ninth Letter

Dear friend,

Here is the answer to the letter I got from our dear sister in the Lord. Please give it to her. She seems really kind, but she wants to move faster than grace allows.

It’s not possible to become spiritually mature all at once.

I suggest you work with her because we should help each other with advice and, even more, by setting a good example. I would like you to send me updates about her now and then, so I can see how she is doing.

Let’s often remember, my dear friend, that our main job in life is to please God. What else really matters? You and I have walked with the Lord for more than forty years. Have we truly used those years to love and serve God, who kindly called us for that purpose? When I think about the blessings God has given and still gives me, I feel ashamed.

I feel like I have wasted those blessings and barely used them to become more like Christ.

Still, God in His mercy gives us a little more time.
