Ninth Letter Dear friend, Here is the answer to the letter I received from our dear sister in the Lord; please give it to her. She seems so full of good will, but she wants to go faster than grace allows.
 
 It is not possible to become spiritually mature all at once.
 
 I recommend that you work with her, because we should help each other with our advice and, even more, with our good example. I would appreciate your sending me news of her from time to time, so that I may know how she is coming along.
 
 Let us often remember, my dear friend, that our sole occupation in life is to please God. What meaning can anything else have? You and I have walked with the Lord for more than forty years. Have we really used those years to love and serve God, who, by His mercy, called us for that purpose? When I consider the blessings God has given and still continues to give me, I feel ashamed.
 
 I feel I have abused those blessings, barely using them profitably to become more like Christ.
 
 50 Ninth Letter 51 Still, God in His mercy gives us a little more time.
