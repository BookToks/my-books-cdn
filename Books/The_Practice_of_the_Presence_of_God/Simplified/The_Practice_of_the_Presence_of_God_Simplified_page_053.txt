He is always with you. Just like it would be rude to ignore a friend who came to visit, it’s disrespectful to ignore God when He is always near.

Don’t forget about Him! Think about Him a lot. Love Him all the time. Live your life with Him in your heart. That’s what being a Christian is really about; it’s what we are supposed to do.

If you don’t understand this, you need to learn it. I will pray for you.
