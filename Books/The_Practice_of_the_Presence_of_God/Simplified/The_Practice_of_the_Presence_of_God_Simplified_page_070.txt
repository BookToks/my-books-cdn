How to Be Close to God

The first way to be close to God is to start a new life by accepting salvation through Jesus Christ.

The second way is to always try to feel God’s presence in your life.

You should do this gently, humbly, and with love, without letting worries or problems take over.

Next, keep your focus on God, especially when you are doing things in the outside world.

It takes a lot of time and effort to get good at this, so don’t get upset if you mess up.

Even though it’s hard to make this a habit, it brings great joy once you learn it.

Your heart is very important because it controls everything you do, both inside and outside.

So, your heart should be the first and last thing to love God in all your actions and in everything you do.
