Believe me, and consider lost all the time that is not spent loving God. Since loving God and loving others are really the same thing, Brother Lawrence cared about the people around him just as much as he cared about God.

He believed that what Christ said in the gospel meant that whatever he did for even the simplest person was like doing it for Jesus. He made sure to help others no matter what he was doing, especially when he worked in the kitchen. There, he treated everyone like they were angels, and this kindness inspired the people who came after him.

He helped poor people as much as he could. He comforted them when they had problems and gave them advice. In short, he did all the good he could for others and tried never to hurt anyone. He did everything he could to bring people closer to God.

Brother Lawrence was not afraid of dying at all. On his deathbed, he showed amazing calmness, acceptance, and happiness. His hope grew stronger and his love became even deeper. If he loved God a lot during his life, he loved Him just as much when he died.
