Even going through hard times is easier when we are with Him, but without Him, even the best fun won’t feel happy. May He be blessed in everything!

Start getting used to showing your love for Him by asking for His help. Give your heart to Him all the time. Don’t limit your love with rules or certain rituals. Step out in faith, with love and being humble.

I am still your servant in the Lord.
