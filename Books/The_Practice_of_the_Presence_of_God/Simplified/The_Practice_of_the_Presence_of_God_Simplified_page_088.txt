He expressed this to me in these words: “God alone is capable of making Himself known as He really is; we search in reasoning and in the sciences, as in a poor copy, for what we neglect to see in an excellent original. God Himself paints Himself in the depths of our souls. We must enliven our faith and elevate ourselves by means of that faith, above all our feelings, to adore God the Father and Jesus Christ in all their divine perfections. This way of faith is the mind of the church, and it suffices to arrive at high perfection.” Brother Lawrence’s principal virtue was his faith. As the just man lives by faith, so it was the life and nourishment of his soul. His spiritual life progressed visibly because of the way his faith quickened his soul. This great faith led him to God, elevating him above the world, which came to appear contemptible in his eyes. As a result, he sought happiness in God alone.
 
 Faith was his greatest instructor. It was faith that gave him an unspeakably high esteem for Jesus Christ, the Son of God who resides as King. He was so devoted to The Life of Brother Lawrence 89 Jesus that he passed many hours, day and night, at His feet to render Him homage and adoration.
