He told me this: “Only God can show Himself as He really is. We try to understand Him through thinking and science, but that’s like looking at a bad copy instead of the real thing. God shows Himself inside our souls. We need to keep our faith alive and use it to rise above our feelings, so we can worship God the Father and Jesus Christ for all their divine goodness. This way of faith is what the church believes, and it’s enough to reach great spiritual growth.”

Brother Lawrence’s main strength was his faith. Just like good people live by faith, his faith was the life and fuel of his soul. You could see his spiritual life getting stronger because his faith made his soul come alive. This strong faith brought him closer to God and helped him see the world as less important. Because of this, he wanted to find happiness only in God.

Faith was his best teacher. It was faith that made him respect Jesus Christ, the Son of God and King, more than anything. He loved Jesus so much that he spent many hours, day and night, near Him to honor and worship Him.
