This remarkable ability was noticed by many learned men. An illustrious bishop of France, who had had several interviews with him, said that God spoke directly to Brother Lawrence, revealing His divine mysteries to him because of the greatness and the purity of his love for Him.
 
 Brother Lawrence loved to seek God in the things He had created. His soul, moved by the grandeur and the diversity of God’s creations, became so powerfully attached to God that nothing could separate it from Him.
 
 He observed in each of creation’s wonders God’s wisdom, His goodness, and the different characteristics of His power. His spirit would become so filled at these times with admiration that he would cry out in love and joy, “O Lord God, how incomprehensible You are in Your thoughts, how profound in Your designs, how powerful in all Your actions.” Brother Lawrence’s Christian walk began with this profound understanding of the power and the wisdom of God. This knowledge became the seed of all his excellence. In the beginning, faith was the only light he used to get to know God. As he matured, he would let nothing but faith guide him in all of God’s ways. He often 88 The Practice of the Presence of God said that everything he heard, everything he found written in books, and even everything that he himself wrote seemed pale in comparison to what faith revealed to him of the glory of God the Father and of Jesus Christ.
