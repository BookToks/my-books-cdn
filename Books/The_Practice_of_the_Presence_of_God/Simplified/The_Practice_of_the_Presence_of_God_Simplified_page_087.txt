Many smart people noticed this amazing ability. A famous bishop from France talked with Brother Lawrence several times and said that God spoke directly to him. God showed Brother Lawrence special secrets because of how much and how purely he loved Him.

Brother Lawrence liked to find God in the things He made. His soul felt very close to God when he saw the greatness and variety of God’s creations. Nothing could separate him from God.

He saw God’s wisdom, kindness, and power in every wonder of creation. Sometimes, his spirit was so full of wonder that he would shout with love and joy, “O Lord God, Your thoughts are so hard to understand, Your plans are so deep, and Your actions are so powerful.” Brother Lawrence’s journey as a Christian started with this deep understanding of God’s power and wisdom. This knowledge was the start of all his goodness.

At first, faith was the only way he got to know God. As he grew, he trusted only faith to guide him in all God’s ways. He often said that everything he heard, read, or even wrote seemed less important compared to what faith showed him about the glory of God the Father and Jesus Christ.
