After Brother Lawrence started to understand how much this special experience helps the soul, he told all his friends to practice it carefully and faithfully. He wanted them to do it with strong determination and courage, so he gave them the best reasons he could to convince them. Because he was very excited about it and showed a good example, he didn’t just affect their minds but also touched their hearts. He helped them to love and do this practice with as much passion as before they didn’t care about it. His example worked better than his words. Just looking at Brother Lawrence made people want to be close to God like he was, even if they were very busy.

Brother Lawrence said that practicing being close to God is the easiest and fastest way to become a perfect Christian and to stay away from sin.

Even when he was very busy in the kitchen, it was clear that Brother Lawrence’s spirit was with God. He often did the work of two people, but he never seemed rushed. Instead, he took the right amount of time for each task, always staying calm and peaceful. He worked neither too fast nor too slow, living with a calm soul and steady peace.
