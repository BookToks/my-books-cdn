We often stop this strong feeling because we don’t respect it enough. But we shouldn’t hold it back anymore. Let’s look inside our hearts, my friend, break down the walls, let grace in, and make up for lost time! You and I are getting older. We might not have much time left. Death is always close, so be ready, because we only die once.

Let’s check ourselves again. Time is running out, and each of us has to take care of our own soul. I believe you have prepared well, so you won’t be caught off guard. I respect you for that. It’s important to stay open to God’s grace. But we have to keep walking with God’s Spirit, because if we don’t move forward in our spiritual life, we actually go backward.

People who have the Holy Spirit inside them keep moving forward even when they sleep. If our soul is still being shaken by storms or strong winds, we should wake up the Lord who has been with us all along, and He will quickly calm the storm.

I’m sharing this with you, my dear friend, so you can think about your relationship with God again. If it has cooled down even a little (I hope not), maybe these words will help bring back your love for God. Do you remember how excited and full of love for God we were at the start?
