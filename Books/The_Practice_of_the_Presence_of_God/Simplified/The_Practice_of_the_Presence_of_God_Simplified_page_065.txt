How to Love God

To love God in spirit and truth means to love Him the right way. Since God is a Spirit, we must love Him with our spirit. This means we should worship Him with honest and humble love that comes from deep inside us. Only God can see this kind of love, and we need to keep showing it until it feels natural, like God and our soul are one. Practice will help us do this.

Second, to love God in truth means to understand who He really is and who we really are. Loving God in truth means our hearts see God as perfect and worthy of all our praise. No matter how smart or not someone is, they would try their best to show respect and love for such a great God.

Third, loving God in truth means admitting that we are very different from Him. But He is willing to make us more like Him if we want. Who would be so careless as to forget the respect, love, service, and constant love we owe to Him?

The Union of the Soul with God

The first way our soul connects with God is through being saved, and this happens only by His grace.
