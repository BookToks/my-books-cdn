On this journey, when you praised him, he heard things that matched both his victory and the pope’s honor.

So if I decide to go, I’m afraid it might be a bad idea. You are wise and know better than I do.” And just like someone who changes their mind and cancels their plan, that’s how I felt on that dark hill, because I thought about the challenge which was once so easy to accept.

“If I understand your words right,” said the generous spirit, “your soul is blocked by fear, which often stops people from doing great things, like how a scared animal freezes when it sees something scary.

Her eyes shone brighter than any star, and she started to speak softly, in her own language, with a voice like an angel.

‘O polite spirit from Mantua, whose fame will last forever, a friend of mine but not lucky, you are stuck on a desert hill, stopped by fear, and I’m afraid you might already be lost.

I’m sorry I didn’t come to help sooner, from what I’ve heard about you in Heaven.’
