The Master spoke and turned me around, not trusting me to hold on to him so I wouldn’t be tricked by his own hands.

You, who don’t understand well, watch closely the lesson hidden beneath these strange words!

Then, through the dirty waves, came a terrifying sound that made both sides shake. It was like a strong wind, wild because of the heat, that breaks trees, beats them down, and carries dust everywhere. It blows fiercely, scaring wild animals and shepherds alike.

I opened my eyes and said, “Look closely along that old foam, right where the smoke is the thickest.” Just like frogs scatter when a snake crosses the water, everyone ran away and hid in the ground.

I saw more than a thousand lost souls running away from someone walking barefoot over the river Styx. He fanned the oily air in front of his face with his left hand, and he looked tired and sad.

I realized he was sent from Heaven. I looked at the Master, who told me to stand quietly and bow before him.

He seemed very proud and full of anger to me!

When he reached the gate, he opened it with a small rod because no one tried to stop him.

“Banished from Heaven, hated by people!”
