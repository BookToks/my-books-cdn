DanteAlighieri-DivineComedy,Inferno 243 He went to Verona as a guest of Bartolomeo I della Scala, then moved to Sarzana in Liguria. Later, he is supposed to have lived in Lucca with Madame Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in Purgatorio, XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources say that he was also in Paris between 1308 and 1310. Other sources, even less trustworthy,takehimtoOxford.
 
 In1310,theHolyRomanEmperorHenryVIIofLuxembourg,marched 5,000 troops into Italy. Dante saw in him a new Charlemagne who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also re-take Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city, suggesting several particular targets that coincided with his personalenemies.

 In Florence, Baldo d’Aguglione pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return; however, Dante had gone too far in hisviolentletterstoArrigo(HenryVII),andhewasnotrecalled.
 
 In1312,HenryassaultedFlorenceanddefeatedtheBlackGuelphs,but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs too and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. In 1313, Henry VII died, and withhimanyhopeforDantetoseeFlorenceagain. HereturnedtoVerona, where Cangrande I della Scala allowed him to live in a certain security and,presumably,inafairamountofprosperity. Cangrandewasadmitted toDante’sParadise(Paradiso,XVII,76).
 
 In 1315, Florence was forced by Uguccione della Faggiuola (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to people in exile, including Dante. But Florence required that as well as paying a sum of money, these exiles would do public penance. Dante refused, preferring toremaininexile.
 
 When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante’s death sentence was commuted to house arrest, on condition that he go to Florence to swear that he would never enter the town again. Dante refused to go. His death sentencewasconfirmedandextendedtohissons.
 
 Dante still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honourable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, strippinghimofmuchofhisidentity.
 
 Ofcourseitneverhappened. PrinceGuidoNovellodaPolentainvited him to Ravenna in 1318, and he accepted. He finished the Paradiso, and 244 http://www.
