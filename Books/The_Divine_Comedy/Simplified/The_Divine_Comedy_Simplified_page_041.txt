Now, sad sounds start to grow louder. I can hear them clearly, and I am coming closer to where many people are crying.

I entered a place with no light at all. It roared like the sea during a storm, like when strong winds fight against each other.

The never-ending angry storm pushes the spirits forward, spinning them around and hitting them hard, causing them pain.
