Florentine turned around and bit himself with his own teeth.

We left him there, and I won’t say more about him; but I could hear some sad cries nearby, so I decided to open my eyes carefully.

The good Master said, “My son, the city called Dis is coming closer, full of dead souls and a huge crowd.” I said, “Master, I can already see red buildings like mosques in that valley, glowing as if they are on fire.” He told me, “That red color comes from the eternal fire inside, making them look like they’re burning, just like you see here in this underworld.”

Then we reached deep moats around that sad city. The walls looked like they were made of iron. After walking around it for a while, we came to a place where a loud guard shouted, “Get off here, this is the entrance.”

At the gates, I saw more than a thousand souls who seemed to have fallen from Heaven. They were angry and asking, “Who is this person who is alive but is walking through the kingdom of the dead?” My smart Master made a sign to the guards.

This is the same Philippo Argenti mentioned in Boccaccio’s story. The Ottimo Comento says he was a proud, showy man who spent a lot but had little goodness. That’s why the author says, “No goodness honors his memory.” Not much else is known about this strange Florentine spirit, forgotten by history but remembered in song.

The word “mosques” helps us imagine the City of Unbelief.

Virgil’s Aeneid describes a similar place: Aeneas suddenly looks back and sees huge prisons surrounded by triple walls and rivers of fire. In front is a giant gate made of solid rock, impossible for men or gods to break. An iron tower stands tall, where the fierce Tisiphone watches day and night.
