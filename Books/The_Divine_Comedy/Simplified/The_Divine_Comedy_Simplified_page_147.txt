Then I turned around, feeling impatient to see what the person needed to escape, and who was suddenly terrified.

While he looked, he didn’t delay leaving; and behind us, I saw a black devil running along the cliff, coming closer.

Wow, he looked really fierce!

He seemed so ruthless in action, with open wings and light feet.

His shoulders were sharp and high, like a strong beast carrying weight, and he held tight to the soft parts of the feet.

From under the bridge, he said, “Malebranche, look! Here’s one of the elders of Saint Zita. Throw him down, because I’m coming back for more from that town full of them.

They’re all corrupt, except Bonturo; no one there is honest for money.” He threw him down over the hard cliff, then turned around and quickly chased after another thief.

The others sank and rose again, facing down; but the demons under the bridge shouted, “There’s no place here for the Santo Volto!”

(The Malebranche are evil devils. Saint Zita is the patron saint of Lucca, where local leaders were called Elders. A barrator is someone who sells justice or jobs for money. Bonturo was the biggest corrupt leader, controlling everything. The Santo Volto, or Holy Face, is a famous crucifix in Lucca’s cathedral, believed to be made by Nicodemus from memory.)
