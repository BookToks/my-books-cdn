But wisdom, love, and goodness will guide the nation between Feltro and Feltro. From that part of Italy, a hero will come who will save the land. Because of him, the maiden Camilla died, and Euryalus, Turnus, and Nisus were wounded. He will chase down envy through every city until he forces it back to Hell, where envy first escaped from.

So, I think the best thing is for you to follow me. I will be your guide and lead you through the eternal place. There, you will hear desperate cries and see ancient spirits who are sad. They cry because they face a second death. You will also see those who are happy, burning in fire because they hope to join the blessed people someday.

If you want to go up to them, there is one soul more worthy than me to help you. When I leave, I will leave you with her. The Emperor who rules above won’t let anyone enter his city through me because I once disobeyed his law.

He rules everywhere, and there is his city and his high throne. Lucky is the one he chooses to enter there! I said to him: “Poet, I beg you, by the same God you never knew, please take me where you said. I want to see the gate of Saint Peter and those you said are so sad.” Then he moved on, and I followed him.
