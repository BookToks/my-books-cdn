Before, I saw horsemen moving their camp,  
getting ready to attack or sometimes trying to run away.  
I saw messengers riding through your land,  
scouts and soldiers going out to look for supplies.  
There were tournaments and jousting matches,  
sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,  
with drums and castle signals,  
using our own sounds and no strange ones.  
But I never saw horsemen move, or foot soldiers,  
nor ships guided by any land or star.

We kept going with the ten demons;  
what wild company! But you find saints in churches,  
and gluttons in taverns!  
I wanted to see everything on the battlefield,  
to know the condition of that place,  
and the people who were being burned there.

Just like dolphins make a sign  
to sailors by arching their backs,  
telling them how to save their ship,  
sometimes, to help ease their pain,
