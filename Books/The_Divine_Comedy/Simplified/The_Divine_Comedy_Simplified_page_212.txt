There was a man pretending to be someone else, trying to get a lady’s valuable mare by faking a will in the style of Buoso Donati. After I watched those two crazy men go by, I turned back to look at another bad person.

I saw someone shaped like a lute, but if only his groin had been cut off right where a man splits in two.

This man had serious dropsy, a sickness that messes up the body with weird fluids. His face didn’t match his big belly, and he had to hold his lips apart, like someone with a fever who, because of thirst, points one lip down and the other up.

He said, “Hey, I’m not suffering, and I don’t know why. Listen carefully to the misery of Master Adam. When I was alive, I had a lot of what I wanted, but now, sadly, I’m just craving a drop of water.

The little streams that flow from the green hills...”
