If you’re Tuscan, you might know who he was.

And since you don’t want me to talk more, just know that I am Camicion de’ Pazzi,  
and wait for Carlino to clear my name.” Then I saw a thousand faces, all purple from the cold;  
a shiver ran through me, and it always will when I see frozen ponds.

As we moved toward the middle,  
where everything important comes together,  
I was shivering in the endless shadow.  
I don’t know if it was my choice, fate, or just chance,  
but while walking among the heads, I accidentally kicked one hard in the face.

He cried out, “Why are you stepping on me?  
Unless you want to help get revenge for Montaperti, why are you bothering me?”  
I said, “My Master, wait here for me,  
so I can ask him something.  
Then you can hurry me along however you want.” The Leader stopped, and I spoke to the one who was still cursing loudly:  
“Who are you, that you judge others like this?”  
He replied, “Who are you to wander through Antenora,  
hitting other people’s faces?  
If you were alive, that would be too much.”  

He killed his own nephew to take his property;  
because of this crime, he was nailed to a coffin and carried through the streets of Florence, then beheaded.

Camicion de’ Pazzi from Valdarno killed his relative Ubertino.  
But his crime seems small compared to another relative, Carlino de’ Pazzi,  
who betrayed the castle of Piano in Valdarno, where many Florentine exiles were captured and killed.  

The speaker is Bocca degli Abati, whose betrayal caused the Guelfs to lose the battle of Montaperti in 1260.  
He cut off the hand of Messer Jacopo de’ Pazzi, who carried the cavalry flag of Florence.  
When the knights and people saw the flag fall and the treachery, they were defeated.  

Antenora is the second part of this circle of hell, named after Antenor, a Trojan prince who betrayed his country by secretly helping the Greeks.  
Virgil calls him the founder of Padua.
