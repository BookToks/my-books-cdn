If the lovely plain that stretches from Vercelli’s hills down to Marcabo  
Can be known by the best people in Fano,  
Like Messer Guido and Angiolello too,  
Then if this warning is not wasted,  
They will be thrown from their ship  
And drowned near Cattolica,  
Because of a cruel tyrant’s betrayal.  

Between the islands of Cyprus and Majorca,  
Neptune has never seen a worse crime—  
Not from pirates or from the Argolic people.
