There were loud sighs, complaints, and cries all around, without a star in the sky. At first, I cried because of it.

Different languages and harsh accents mixed with angry words and painful voices. People shouted and made a noisy mess that kept going forever in the dark air, like dust swirling in the wind.

I, feeling scared, asked, “Master, what is this sound I hear? Who are these people who seem defeated by pain?”

He answered, “These unhappy souls are sad because they lived their lives without doing anything famous or bad. They are mixed together with that unlucky group.”
