“Isn’t every vapor stopped down here?”  
Then I said to him, “Soon you’ll be where your eyes can answer mine, seeing the reason why the storm is blowing.”  

One of the poor souls trapped in the frozen ice shouted to us, “Oh merciless souls, since you’re the last to arrive, please lift the frozen veil from my eyes so I can let out some of the pain weighing on my heart before the tears freeze again.”  

I answered him, “If you want me to help you, tell me who you are. And if I can’t free you, may I sink to the bottom of the ice.”  

He replied, “I am Friar Alberigo. I’m one of the bad fruits in this frozen garden, the result of terrible betrayal.”  

I asked, “Oh, are you dead too?”  
He said, “How could my body still be alive in the world? I don’t know. This place has a strange power that makes souls come here even before death takes them.”
