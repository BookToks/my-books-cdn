Following the sun, we left the empty world behind.

Think about where you came from; you weren’t made to live like animals, but to seek goodness and knowledge. I was so excited that my friends wanted to start the journey right away, and I could barely stop them.

We turned the back of our boat toward the morning, and with our oars moving like wings, we kept moving forward, leaning more to the left side.

All the stars at the other pole were already visible that night, but ours stayed very low and didn’t rise above the ocean.

Since we entered this deep passage, the moon’s light had flashed on and off five times.

Then we saw a mountain in the distance, dim but so tall it looked higher than any mountain I’d ever seen.

We felt happy at first, but then we started to cry. A big whirlwind rose from the new land and hit the front of our ship.

The wind spun the ship around in the water three times. The fourth time, it lifted the back and pushed the front down, twisting the ship however it wanted, until the sea above us closed again.
