I followed him, and we hadn’t gone far before we heard the sound of water nearby, so loud that it was hard to hear anything else.

It was like a stream that keeps its own path, the first one from Monte Veso toward the East. On the left side of the Apennine mountains, there’s a stream called Acquacheta before it goes down into its riverbed. At Forlì, it’s no longer called that.

The water echoes above San Benedetto, falling all at once from the Alps, making a big splash. There was room for thousands near the fall. We found ourselves near the dark, rushing water, so loud it almost hurt our ears.

I had a cord tied around me.
