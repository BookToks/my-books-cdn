Out of each mouth stuck out the feet of someone being punished, and their legs up to the calves were sticking out, while the rest of their bodies stayed inside.

All of their soles were burning so badly that their joints shook violently, and they looked like they might break apart.

Just like how oil flames move only on the surface, the fire moved only from their heels to their toes.

I asked, “Master, who is that one twisting around more than the others, and whose red flames are burning him harder?” He told me, “If you want to come with me down there to the lowest place, you’ll learn about his mistakes and who he really is.” I said, “Whatever you want is fine with me; you’re my Lord, and I won’t leave your side. You know what I’m thinking even when I don’t say it.” 

Soon we reached the fourth ditch; we turned left and went down to the bottom full of narrow holes.

My good Master didn’t let me go until we got to the hole where the man with the burning legs was.

I said, “Whoever you are, standing upside down like a sad soul stuck in the ground, if you can, please speak.” It was like a friar hearing a confession from a criminal who was punished by being buried upside down with his feet in the air—a cruel punishment done by the law in Florence. Dante stood there, bent over, like the friar waiting for the criminal to talk.
