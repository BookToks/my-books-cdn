I turned around and saw a lake beneath my feet that looked like glass, not water because it was frozen.

The ice was so thick that even if something heavy fell on it, it wouldn’t crack or make a sound.

Just like a frog sticks its nose out of the water when it’s dreaming, there were sad spirits trapped in the ice, showing their pain with frozen faces.

Each spirit looked down sadly, with cold coming from their mouths and sadness from their eyes.

As I looked around, I saw two spirits so close that their hair was mixed together.

I asked them, "You who hold each other so tightly, who are you?" They bent their necks and looked at me.

Their eyes, which were first just wet, started crying tears that froze on their faces.

No clamp could hold wood together as tightly as these two spirits held each other, pushing against each other like two angry goats.

One spirit, who had lost both ears because of the cold, looked down and asked me, “Why do you look at us with such pity?”

If you want to know who these two are, they are brothers named Alessandro and Napoleone, sons of Alberto, a lord who died long ago.
