I was at a place where I heard the loud sound of water falling into the next circle, like the buzzing sound bees make when three shadows started running from a group passing under a sharp storm of suffering.

They came toward us, and each one shouted, “Stop, you! Your clothes make us think you belong to our wicked city.” Oh no! I saw terrible wounds on their bodies, some fresh and some old, all burned by flames!

It still hurts me to remember it.

My teacher stopped and listened to their cries; he turned to me and said, “Wait now; we should be polite to them.”

He said that if it weren’t for the fire around us, he would say these people looked more like bees than sinners.

As soon as we stood still, they started their old chant again, and when they caught up to us, the three of them formed a spinning wheel.

Like wrestlers who are ready and watching for their chance before fighting, they turned around, each one facing me so their necks and feet moved all the time.
