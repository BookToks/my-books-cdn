Near is another rock that has a path.

Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,  
One thousand two hundred sixty-six years had passed since the path was broken.

I send some of my followers in that direction  
To see if anyone dares to harm them;  
Go with them, because they won’t be dangerous.

“Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,”  
He began to call out, “and you, Cagnazzo;  
And Barbariccia, lead the ten.

Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,  
And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,  
And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;  
Search all around the boiling pitch;  
Let them be safe as far as the next rock,  
So all the unbroken paths over the pits are guarded.”

“Hey! What is that, Master, that I see?  
Please let us go without guards,  
If you know how, because I ask for none myself.

If you are as watchful as usual,  
Don’t you see that the dogs are showing their teeth,  
And with their angry brows, they threaten us?”  
And he said to me: “I won’t be afraid;  
Let them gnash their teeth as they like,  
Because they do it for those boiling sinners.”
