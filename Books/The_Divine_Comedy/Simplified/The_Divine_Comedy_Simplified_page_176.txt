If you, Reader, find it hard to believe what I’m about to say, don’t be surprised. I barely believed it myself.

As I was raising my eyebrows in surprise, a snake with six feet suddenly jumped in front of someone and wrapped itself tightly around him.

It used its middle feet to wrap around his belly, and its front feet grabbed his arms. Then it bit through one cheek and out the other. Its back feet stretched over his thighs, and its tail went between them, spreading out behind like reins.

Ivy never clings to trees like this creepy snake wrapped itself around the other guy’s limbs.

Then they stuck together like hot wax mixed and melted, blending their colors. Neither looked like themselves anymore; they were mixed up, like a flame moving up brown paper, changing the color but not yet black.

Two others watched and shouted, “Oh me, Agnello, look how you’ve changed!

Look, you’re no longer one or two.” The two heads had already become one, and two faces blended into one where both were lost.

From the four limbs, two arms were made. The thighs, legs, belly, and chest all became parts no one had seen before.

Every original feature was erased; the twisted image was both two and one at the same time.
