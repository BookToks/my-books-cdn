When the younger Fanny was born on April 7, 1847, Dr. Nathan Cooley Keep used ether as the first painkiller during childbirth in the United States for Fanny Longfellow. A few months later, on November 1, 1847, the poem “Evangeline” was published for the first time.

On June 14, 1853, Longfellow had a goodbye dinner at his home in Cambridge for his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was moving overseas. Soon after, Longfellow stopped working at Harvard in 1854 to focus only on writing. In 1859, Harvard gave him an honorary law degree.

Frances Longfellow was a loving husband and father who enjoyed family life. But both of his marriages ended in sadness.

One hot day in July, while Fanny was trying to seal a child’s lock of hair in an envelope with hot wax, her dress caught fire and she got badly burned. She died the next day, July 10, 1861, at age 44. Longfellow was heartbroken and never really got over her death.

He showed how deeply he grieved in a poem called “The Cross of Snow” (1879), which he wrote 18 years later to remember her:  
Such is the cross I wear upon my breast  
These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes  
And seasons, changeless since the day she died.

In March 1882, Longfellow went to bed with bad stomach pain. He suffered for several days, using opium to help with the pain, before he died on Friday, March 24, 1882, surrounded by his family. He had a disease called peritonitis.

He is buried with both of his wives at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1884, he became the first and only American poet to have a sculpted bust placed in Poet’s Corner at Westminster Abbey in London.
