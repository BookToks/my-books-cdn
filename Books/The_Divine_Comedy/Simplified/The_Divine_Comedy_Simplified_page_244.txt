When the wings spread wide, he held tightly onto the messy sides. He fell down through the thick hair and the frozen crust.

We came to the spot where the thigh turns on the thick part of the hip. The Guide, breathing hard and working hard, turned his head where his legs were. He grabbed the hair like someone climbing up, so much that I thought we were going back to Hell.

“Hold on tight, because on stairs like these,” the Master said, panting like someone tired, “we have to force ourselves away from so much evil.” Then he came out through a hole in a rock and sat me down on the edge. After that, he stretched out his careful step toward me.

I looked up, hoping to see Lucifer the same way I left him, and I saw him holding his legs upward.

If I got worried then, let people who don’t see understand why I went beyond that point.

“Get up,” the Master said, “the way is long and the road is hard, and now the sun is at the middle tierce.” It wasn’t a palace hallway where we were, but a natural dungeon with an uneven floor and little light.

“Before I tear myself away from the abyss, Master,” I said after I stood.

“To pull me from a mistake, speak a little. Where is the ice? And how is this one stuck?”

The day was divided into four equal parts, called in Italian Terza, Sesta, Nona, and Vespro, which change length with the seasons.

Dante says these hours are shorter or longer depending on the day and night. Terza was the first part after sunrise, and at the equinox, it would be from six to nine. So, mezzaterza, or middle tierce, would be half past seven.
