“Upside down? How did the sun get from evening to morning so fast?” I asked. He said, “You still think you’re past the center, where I grabbed the hair of the terrible monster who eats the world.

That’s where you were while I was going down. But when I turned around, you passed the point where heavy things are pulled from every side. Now you’re under the other half of the sky, opposite the huge land where the man without sin was born and died.

Your feet are on the small globe that makes the other side of Judecca. It’s morning here when it’s evening there. And the man with the hair like a staircase who made us stay still is still the same as before.

On this side, he fell out of heaven; and all the land that once rose here hid itself in the sea because it was afraid of him, and moved to our hemisphere. Maybe to escape him, what you see here once left its place and moved back.

There’s a place below, as far away as Beelzebub’s tomb, that you can’t see but can hear because of a small stream flowing down through a crack in the stone. It has worn the rock with rough winds and falls gently.

My guide and I went down this hidden path to return to the bright world, moving forward without stopping to rest.”
