I wanted to know who these people were and what rule made them ready to cross, as I looked across the dim light.

He said to me, “You will learn all about them when we set foot on the dark shore of the river Acheron.”

I looked down shyly, afraid my questions might annoy him, so I stayed quiet until we reached the river.

Suddenly, an old man with gray hair came toward us in a boat. He shouted, “Woe to you, lost souls! You will never see the sky again. I am here to take you to the other side, to the place of endless heat and cold.”

Then he told me, “You, living soul standing there, stay away from these dead people!”

But when he saw I didn’t move back, he said, “You will reach the shore another way, not by this boat.”
