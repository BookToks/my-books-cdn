When I was listening to them, I was completely focused. Then the Master said to me, “Look, I almost argued with you over something small.”  

When I heard him speak with anger, I turned around feeling so ashamed that the memory still hurts me today.  

He is like someone who dreams about bad things happening to himself and wishes those dreams weren’t real. That’s how I felt—I couldn’t even speak. I wanted to explain myself and kept trying to do so, but I don’t think I really did.  

The Master said, “It’s better to be less ashamed by fixing a bigger mistake than by what you did. So, let go of all your sadness, and remember that I might be by your side. If you ever get into a fight with others, it’s a bad idea to want to hear everything they say.”
