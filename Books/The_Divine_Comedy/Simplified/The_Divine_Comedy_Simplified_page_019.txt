Day was ending, and the darkening air let the animals rest after their hard work. I was the only one who got ready to face the difficult journey and the pain it would bring, memories that don’t lie.

Muses, great thinkers, please help me now!

Memory, who wrote down what I saw, here your greatness will be clear!

I started: “Poet, who guides me, look at my courage, if it’s enough.

If you trust me with this hard path, then tell me.

You say that Silvius’ father, while still mortal, went to the immortal world in a physical body.

But if the enemy of all evil was kind, thinking about the great result from him, it’s not strange to smart people.

Because he belonged to great Rome and its empire, chosen as a father in heaven.

I want to speak the truth about the holy place where the successor of the greatest Peter sits.”
