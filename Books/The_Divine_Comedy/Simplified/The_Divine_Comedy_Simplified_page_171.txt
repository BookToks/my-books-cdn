People were running around naked and scared.

They didnâ€™t have any hope of hiding or protecting themselves.

They had snakes wrapped around their hands, tied behind their backs. The snakes were biting their reins, tails, and heads, and were twisted in front of them.

Suddenly, one person near us was attacked by a snake that quickly pierced him right where his neck connects to his shoulders.

He burned up faster than I have ever seen, turning completely into ashes as he fell.

When he hit the ground and was destroyed, the ashes gathered together by themselves.
