Dante pointed with his finger and named those whom Love had separated from our world.

After that, I listened to my teacher as he named old ladies and knights. I felt sorry for them and almost got confused.

Then I said, “Oh poet, please speak to those two who are together and seem so light, floating in the wind.” He told me, “You’ll notice when they come closer to us. Then you can ask them kindly, by the love that brings them here, and they will come.” 

As soon as the wind blew toward us, I raised my voice: “Hey tired souls! Come talk to us if no one stops you.” 

Like turtle doves flying to their sweet nest because they want to, those two came from the group where Dido is, flying through the bad air toward us. The feeling in my request was very strong.

“Oh living being who is kind and good, visiting us through the dark purple air, we who made the world bloody. If we were friends with the King of the Universe, we would pray to him to give you peace because you have pity on our sad state.

Tell us what you want to hear and speak, and we will listen and talk to you while the wind is quiet, like it is now.

I was born in the city by the sea where the Po river flows.”
