The whole plain stretched out all around us, just like my Guide had said.

Near the bottom of the hill, centaurs were running in a line, carrying bows and arrows, just like they do in the real world when they chase something.

When they saw us coming down, they all stopped. Three of them broke away from the group, holding their bows and arrows ready. One of them shouted from far away, “What punishment are you coming to, climbing down this hill? Tell us where you’re from, or I’ll shoot my arrow.”

My Master said, “We’ll answer Chiron, who is close to you. This won’t be a good moment for your quick temper.” 

The centaurs are guarding this part of Hell, which represents violence. Classic poets often connect centaurs with violence in some way.
