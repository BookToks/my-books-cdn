When I saw two people frozen together in one hole, I asked, “Hey, you who show such anger while you’re biting someone, tell me why.” I said, “If you have a good reason to hate him and know who he is and what he did, I promise to repay you in the world above if what I say isn’t true.”  

The sinner lifted his mouth from biting and wiped it on the hair of the same head he was biting before. Then he started to speak: “You want me to tell you again the terrible pain that already breaks my heart just thinking about it. But if my words can make others hate the traitor I’m biting, then I’ll keep talking and crying at the same time.”
