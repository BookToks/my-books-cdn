I had a scary dream, and I heard the sound of a door locking in the horrible tower below. Without saying a word, I looked at my sons' faces.

I didn’t cry; I turned cold inside. They cried, and my dear little Anselm said, "Father, why do you look at us like that?" I didn’t cry or answer all day or even during the night, until the sun came up again.

Then a little bit of light came into the sad prison, and I saw my own face in my sons' faces. I bit my hands in pain, thinking I was hungry. Suddenly, they stood up and said, "Father, it will hurt us less if you eat from us; you made us with this poor flesh, and now you are tearing it off." I calmed down so I wouldn’t make them more sad.

That day we all stayed quiet, and the next day too.

Oh, hard earth, why didn’t you open up when the fourth day came? Gaddo threw himself down at my feet and said, "Father, why don’t you help me?" Then he died. As he fell, I saw the other three die one by one between the fifth and sixth days. I was already blind, feeling around for each of them. I called their names for three days after they died. Then hunger did what sadness couldn’t.
