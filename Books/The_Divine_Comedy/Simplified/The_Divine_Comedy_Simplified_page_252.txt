Dante’s poems were sold in apothecary shops. As a politician, he didn’t achieve much, but he held different jobs for several years in a city full of political fights.

After beating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs split into two groups: the White Guelphs, which was Dante’s group led by Vieri dei Cerchi, and the Black Guelphs, led by Corso Donati. At first, the split was about family rivalries, but later it became about different opinions on the Pope’s role in Florence. The Blacks supported the Pope, while the Whites wanted more freedom from him.

At first, the Whites were in charge and kicked out the Blacks.

In response, Pope Boniface VIII planned to take over Florence with an army. In 1301, Charles de Valois, brother of the French king Philip the Fair, was expected to visit Florence because the Pope made him the peacekeeper for Tuscany. But the city’s leaders had treated the Pope’s messengers badly a few weeks earlier because they wanted independence from the Pope. People thought Charles de Valois might have secret orders from the Pope, so the city sent a group, including Dante, to Rome to find out what the Pope really wanted.

Exile and Death  
Boniface quickly sent away the other messengers and asked Dante to stay in Rome. At the same time, on November 1, 1301, Charles de Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs. In six days, they destroyed a lot of the city and killed many enemies. The Black Guelphs took over the government, and Messer Cante dei Gabrielli di Gubbio became the ruler of Florence. Dante was sentenced to two years of exile and had to pay a big fine. He was still in Rome, where the Pope had told him to stay, so he was seen as running away. Dante didn’t pay the fine because he thought he wasn’t guilty and because the Black Guelphs had taken all his property in Florence. He was then sentenced to exile forever, and if he came back without paying, he could be burned at the stake.

Dante joined the White Guelphs in trying to take back power, but they failed because of betrayals. He became angry at how his enemies treated him and also tired of the fighting and weakness of his own friends. He decided to work alone.

At this point, he started planning the Divine Comedy, a long poem with 100 parts called cantos, divided into three books of 33 cantos each, plus one introduction canto.
