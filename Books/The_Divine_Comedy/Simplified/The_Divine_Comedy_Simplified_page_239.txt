422 And so you will more easily wipe away these glassy tears from my face, know this: as soon as someone betrays like I did, a demon takes over their body and controls it until their time is completely finished.

The body then falls into a kind of pit; and maybe you can still see the body of that shadow over there, where the winter is behind me.

You should know this if you just came down here: it is Ser Branca d’Oria, and many years have passed since he was locked up like that.

“I think,” I said to him, “you must be tricking me; because Branca d’Oria is not dead yet, and he eats, drinks, sleeps, and wears clothes.” 

“In the moat above,” he said, “in Malebranche, where the sticky pitch boils, Michel Zanche has not arrived yet. When he left, he left a devil in his place, in his own body, and one of his family who betrayed with him.

422 Of the three Fates, Clotho held the distaff, Lachesis spun the thread, and Atropos cut it.

423 Ser Branca d’Oria was a Genoese and part of the famous Doria family. But he killed his father-in-law, Michel Zanche, at a meal, who is mentioned in Canto XXII.

424 The harsh words about the Genoese remind us of a bitter Tuscan saying about them: “Sea without fish; mountains without trees; men without faith; and women without shame.”
