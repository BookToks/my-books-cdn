Nessus hadn’t reached the other side yet, when we stepped into a forest. There was no path to follow at all.

The leaves weren’t green, but dark and gloomy. The branches weren’t smooth, but twisted and tangled. Instead of apple trees, there were thorny bushes with poison.

These thick, messy woods are even wilder than the ones where savage animals live between Cecina and Corneto, near the farm fields. That’s where the horrible Harpies make their nests.

The Harpies chased the Trojans away from the Strophades islands, bringing sad news of bad things to come. They have big wings, human necks and faces, claws for feet, and big feathers on their bellies. They cry sadly on the strange trees.

My good guide said, “If you go further in, know that you are in the second circle, and you will stay there until you come out on the other side of the terrible woods. So look carefully around you, and you will see things that will prove I’m telling the truth.”

I heard cries of sadness all around, but I couldn’t see anyone making those sounds.
