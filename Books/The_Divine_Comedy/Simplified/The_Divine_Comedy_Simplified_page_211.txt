Someone was biting like a wild animal running along a board when it got loose.

A man named Capocchio came, and the creature grabbed his neck with its teeth. As it dragged him, his belly scraped against the hard floor.

Another man from Arezzo, who was shaking and stayed back, said to me: “That crazy spirit is Gianni Schicchi, and he’s going around stealing from others.” I said, “Oh, maybe it’s not him. Don’t get tired of telling me who it is before it leaves.” He answered: “That is the old ghost of Myrrha, who did something terrible and became her own father’s lover.

She came to sin with him in this way.”
