Inferno Canto 12

The place where we went down the bank was like a mountain, and it looked so scary that anyone would close their eyes.

It was like the broken side of a cliff near the Adige River, not far from Trent. The cliff had been smashed, maybe by an earthquake or something else, all the way from the top of the mountain down to the plain. The path looked like it could fall apart easily.

The ravine we walked down was just like that. On the edge of the deep crack stood a strange creature known from stories—the Minotaur, who was half bull, half man. When he saw us, he got really angry, like someone full of rage inside.

My guide shouted at him: “Maybe you think this is the Duke of Athens, who killed people up above?

Go away, beast! This guy didn’t come here because of your sister, but for another reason.”
