In that thick, dark air, I saw a figure swimming upward. It was amazing to see, even for the strongest heart.  

Sometimes, when someone comes back up after going down, they clear an anchor stuck on a reef or something hidden in the sea. The person stretches upward and pulls their feet free.  

The spirits were thrown down to their places as soon as Minos decided their fate.
