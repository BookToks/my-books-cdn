He said, "Anyone in this group who stops for even a moment is dead for nearly a hundred years, and fire doesn’t even hurt them.

So keep moving; I will come to the edge of this place, and then I will join my group again, who are always sad because of their eternal punishment."

I didn’t dare leave the path to walk with him, but I kept my head down like someone who is very respectful.

Then he asked me, "What luck or fate brought you down here before the last day?

And who is the person showing you the way?"

I answered, "Up there in the peaceful life, I got lost in a valley, or maybe I had already lived my full life.

But yesterday morning, I turned away from it; this one showed up to me, going back that way, and is leading me home along this road."

He said to me, "If you follow your star, you cannot fail to reach a great place, if I judged your life well and thought it beautiful.

And if I hadn’t died so early, seeing Heaven so kind to you, I would have helped you on your journey.

But those ungrateful and evil people, who came long ago from Fesole, and who still talk about the mountain and the rocks, will become your enemies because of your good actions.

And that’s fair; among sour grapes, it’s natural for the sweet fig to bear fruit.

People say they are blind; they are greedy, jealous, and proud."
