When he said this, his eyes looked strange. The poor skull started talking again, showing its strong teeth that looked like a dog’s biting on a bone.

Ah! Pisa, you are a shame to the people of the beautiful land where the Sid river flows. Since the neighbors are slow to punish the bad ones, let the islands of Capraia and Gorgona move and block the mouth of the Arno river.

Capraia and Gorgona are two islands near the mouth of the Arno. A man named Ampère once said this idea might seem weird if you look at a map because Gorgona is a bit far from the Arno’s mouth. But when he climbed a tower in Pisa, he saw Gorgona looked like it was closing the river’s mouth. Then he understood how Dante could have had this idea. Dante didn’t see Gorgona from the Leaning Tower (which wasn’t there in his time), but from other towers around Pisa. This made his imagination make sense.
