A deep tiredness was in my head, but then a loud thunder woke me up suddenly. It felt like someone forced me awake. I opened my eyes and looked around, standing up straight and trying to figure out where I was.

I realized I was at the edge of a dark, painful valley that echoed with endless cries.

It was so dark and deep that when I stared into it, I couldn’t see anything at all.

The Poet, looking pale, said, “Let’s go down into this dark world. I’ll go first, and you follow me.” I noticed he looked scared and said, “How can I follow if you’re afraid? You’re supposed to help me feel less scared.” He answered, “The sadness of the people below shows on my face. That’s why you feel scared. But let’s keep going because we have a long way to travel.” 

So he went in first and made me follow him into the first circle that surrounds the abyss.

From what I heard, I seemed to be crossing the river Acheron while asleep. I woke up at the edge of the painful valley of the abyss. Now I was entering the First Circle of Hell, called Limbo—the borderland, as the name suggests.
