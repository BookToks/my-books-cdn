Justice inspired my amazing Creator; He made me with divine power, the greatest wisdom, and pure love.

Before I existed, nothing was created yet. Only eternity was there, and it lasts forever.

On the top of a gate, I saw words written in a dark, serious way: “Abandon all hope, you who enter here!” I said, “Master, I don’t understand what this means!” He answered me, like someone who knows a lot: “Here, you have to give up all doubt and fear.

We have come to a place where I told you, you will see people who have lost the good of understanding.” Then, he happily placed his hand on mine, which made me feel better. He guided me through these hidden things.
