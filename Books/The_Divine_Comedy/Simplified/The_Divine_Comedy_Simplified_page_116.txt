Then I started: “Sadness, not anger, took hold of me because of your situation. It was slowly taken away as soon as my Lord spoke to me. His words made me think that people like you were coming.

I come from your city, and I have always listened to and admired your hard work and good reputation.

I will leave the bitter things behind and go for the sweet rewards promised by the true Leader. But first, I must go to the heart of the city.”

“May your soul guide your limbs for a long time,” he answered me. “And may your fame grow after you—bravery and kindness, if they still live in our city as they used to, or if they have disappeared completely. Guglielmo Borsiere, who is suffering here with us now and goes with his friends, greatly troubles us with his words.

The new people and sudden wealth have caused pride and wastefulness in Florence, so much that you are already crying there!”

I said this with my face lifted, and the three, hearing my reply, looked at each other as if seeing the truth.

“If it costs you so little to please others at other times,” they all replied, “you are lucky to speak your mind now!

So, if you escape these dark places and come to see the beautiful stars, it will be a joy for you to say, ‘I was there.’”
