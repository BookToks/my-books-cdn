Figure 59: “This proud one wanted to test his own power...” I don’t know who tied him up, but he was chained tightly behind his right arm and in front of the other. The chains wrapped around him from his neck down to where his body was not covered, going as far as his fifth circle.

“This proud one wanted to challenge the greatest god,” my leader said, “and that’s why he got punished like this.

His name is Ephialtes, and he was very strong.

Back when giants scared the gods, the arms he used never moved again.” 

I said to him, “If I could, I would like to see the giant Briareus with his hundred hands.

These eyes of mine would like to witness that.”
