paskvil.com/ I fell down from that sweet Latin land,  
From where I bring all my wrongdoings.

Because of their cruel rulers.

The eagle of Polenta lives there,  
So she protects the town of Cervia with her wings.  

The city that once fought for a long time,  
And defeated the bloody French,  
Now sits beneath the Green Paws again;  
The old and new Mastiffs of Verrucchio,  

Who badly treated Montagna,  
Where they like to tear apart their enemies with their teeth.  

The cities of Lamone and Santerno...”
