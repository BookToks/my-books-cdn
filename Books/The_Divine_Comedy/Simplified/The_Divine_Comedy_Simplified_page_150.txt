My Master said, “You’re safe here because of your skills, not because of luck or fate. Let me continue, because it’s meant to be that I show this dangerous path to someone else.”  

Then he became humble and dropped his grappling hook at his feet. He told the others, “Don’t attack him now.” Then he said to my Guide, “You, who sit among the broken pieces of the bridge, come back to me safely.”  

So I moved quickly to him, but all the devils rushed forward, and I was scared they wouldn’t keep their promise.  

At that moment, I saw the soldiers from Caprona, who looked scared because they were surrounded by so many enemies.  

I pressed myself close to my Leader and didn’t take my eyes off the soldiers, whose faces didn’t look good.  

They lowered their rakes and said to each other, “Do you want me to hit him from behind?” One answered, “Yes, make sure you strike him with it.” But the same demon who was talking with my Guide turned quickly and said, “Be quiet, Scarmiglione.”  

Then he said to us, “You can’t go any further on this cliff because the sixth arch of the bridge is broken and lies shattered at the bottom.  

If you still want to go forward, follow the path along this rock.”
