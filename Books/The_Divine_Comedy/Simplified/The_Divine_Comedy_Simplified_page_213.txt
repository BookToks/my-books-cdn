Dante talks about how the rivers in Cassentino flow down into the Arno, making the area cold and wet. He says their image stays fresh in his mind, more than the sickness that makes his face lose its skin.

The strict punishment he is facing comes from the place where he sinned, making his suffering even worse.

He mentions Rome, where he faked coins with the image of John the Baptist, and because of that, his body was burned above.

Dante wishes he could see the sad soul of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother. For the sake of Branda’s fountain, he wouldn’t want to see it.

One soul is already inside, and the crazy spirits around speak the truth. But Dante wonders what good it does him, since his limbs are tied.

If he were lighter, and could move just a little in a hundred years, he would have already started looking for that soul among the dirty people, even though the place is eleven miles around and at least half a mile across.

He says he belongs to that group; they tricked him into making fake gold coins, which had three marks of impurity. He asks, “Who are the two poor souls that smoke like wet hands in winter, lying close to your right side?”

A note explains that the valley of the Arno is in Cassentino. Another comment says that these verses make you feel a fresh, damp chill, almost like being punished like Adam. It also mentions a theory that the city of Dis in the Inferno represents Rome.
