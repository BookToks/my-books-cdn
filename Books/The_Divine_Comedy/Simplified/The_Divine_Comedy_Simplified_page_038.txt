Before others, I saw Democritus, who said the world is based on chance, Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales, Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus. 

I also saw the best collector of qualities, high Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw me too, along with Tully and Livy, and wise Seneca. Euclid, the math guy, Ptolemy, Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna were there. 

Averroes, who wrote a big commentary, was there as well. I can’t describe all of them fully because the story is long, and sometimes words just don’t match the facts.

These six groups are split into two parts. My wise guide takes me from a calm place to the shaky air, then to a place where nothing shines.

Avicenna was a doctor from Ispahan in the 11th century. He was born in 980 and died in 1036.

Averroes was a scholar from the 12th century who translated and explained Aristotle’s works. He was born in Cordova in 1149 and died in Morocco around 1200. He led Western philosophy, while Avicenna led the Eastern school.
