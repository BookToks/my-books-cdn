Because I cared about my hometown, I gathered the scattered leaves and gave them back to the man who was now very hoarse.

Then we reached the boundary where the second and third rounds are separated, and where a terrible kind of justice is shown.

To explain these strange things clearly, I say we arrived at a plain where nothing can grow from its dry ground. The sad forest around it looks like a wreath, and this plain is like a sad moat around the forest. We stopped right at the edge.

The ground was made of dry, thick sand, just like the kind Cato once walked on. God’s punishment is so strong—everyone should fear it when they see what I saw with my own eyes!

I saw many naked souls crying very sadly, and there seemed to be a different law over them.

Some people were lying face-up on the ground; some were sitting close together; and others were walking around all the time.
