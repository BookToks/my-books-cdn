A giant old man stands in the mountain,  
He turns his shoulders toward Damietta,  
And looks at Rome like it’s his own reflection.  
His head is made of pure gold,  
His arms and chest are silver;  
Then his body is brass down to the forks.  

From there down, everything is iron,  
Except his right foot, which is made of baked clay,  
And he puts more weight on that foot than on the other.  

Every part except the gold has cracks,  
And from those cracks, tears drip down,  
These tears gather and drip through holes,  
Falling from rock to rock into a valley below;  
They form rivers called Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon.  
Then the water flows down a narrow channel  
Until it reaches a place where it no longer falls.  

There, the waters form a pool called Cocytus;  
What that pool looks like, you will see for yourself,  
So I won’t describe it now.  

I asked him, “If this river comes from our world,  
Why can we only see it here at this edge?”  
He answered, “You know the place is round,  
And even though you’ve traveled far,  
You haven’t yet gone all the way around the circle,  
Since you are still going down to the left.  

So if you see something new,  
Don’t be surprised.”  

Then I asked again, “Master, where can we find  
Lethe and Phlegethon?  
You didn’t mention one,  
And the other you said comes from this rain.”  

(Notes:  
The giant represents different ages of man made from gold, silver, brass, and iron.  
The tears are like the rivers of the underworld flowing into Cocytus.  
The statue looks toward Rome, symbolizing time.)
