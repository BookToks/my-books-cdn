After he opened his big mouth, he said to his friends, “Do you know that the one behind moves whatever he touches?  
This is not something dead people’s feet usually do.” My good Guide, who was now close to him, where the two natures meet, answered: “He is alive, and only because of that does he need to see the dark valley; we go there out of necessity, not because we want to.  

Someone stopped singing Hallelujah, the person who gave me this new job; neither he nor I am a thief or have a thief’s spirit.  

But by the power that moves me, I walk along this wild path. Give us one of your people to come with us, someone who can show us where to cross the river, and who can carry this one on his back; no spirit can walk through the air.”  

Chiron turned to his right side and said to Nessus: “Turn around and guide them, and watch out if other groups meet you.” We moved forward with our faithful guide along the edge of the red boiling river, where those in the river were crying loudly.

Here they regret their cruel actions; this is a true and real scene, almost like it was copied from real life. It shows small details and close moments that no one would think of or show unless the artist had seen them in real life or believed in them deeply. For example, Dante’s Centaur, Chiron, splits his beard with his arrow before he speaks. No one would have imagined this if they hadn’t actually seen a Centaur do it. They might have made up nice bodies of men and horses in many ways but never thought of this. The real Centaur actually appeared in Dante’s mind, and he saw him do it.”
