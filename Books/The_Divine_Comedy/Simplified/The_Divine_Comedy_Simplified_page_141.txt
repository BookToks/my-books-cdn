Inferno Canto 20

I had to make new verses  
and add material to the twentieth canto  
of the first song, which is about what’s hidden below.

I was ready to look down  
into the uncovered depths,  
which were soaked with tears of pain.  

People saw me through the round valley,  
quiet and crying, moving at  
the slow pace of prayers in this world.  

As my eyes went lower,  
each person looked strange,  
twisted from their chin to their chest.  

Their faces were turned backward,  
and they had to move that way,  
because they couldn’t look forward.

Maybe someone with a bad illness  
could be turned like that,  
but I never saw it or believed it could happen.  

Reader, I hope you understand  
what I’m trying to say.  
Think about how I could keep from crying  
when I saw your own image near me,  
so twisted that tears flowed  
down the cracks and soaked the back parts.  

I really cried, leaning on a peak.
