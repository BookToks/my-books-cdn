We reached the edge of a high cliff made of huge broken rocks arranged in a circle. There, we found an even more terrible crowd of people. The smell coming from the deep pit was so awful that we moved back behind a big tomb to get away from it. On the tomb, I saw some writing that said: “Pope Anastasius I is here, who was led astray by Photinus.”

My guide said, “We need to go down slowly so our senses can get used to the horrible smell bit by bit, and then it won’t bother us so much.” I told him, “Try to find something to make the time go faster.”
