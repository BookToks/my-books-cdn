The people there didn’t cry out loudly, but only sighed, and that made the air feel heavy and sad.

These sighs came from sadness without pain, from a crowd made up of many infants, women, and men.

I asked the Master, “Can you tell me what kind of spirits these are that we see?”

He said, “I’ll explain before we go further. These souls didn’t sin; if they had, it wouldn’t be enough to punish them this way because they weren’t baptized, which is the gateway to the Faith you believe in. And if they lived before Christianity, they didn’t worship God properly. I am among them too, punished only for these reasons, not for other sins, and we live without hope, full of desire.”

Hearing this made me very sad because I recognized some good people I knew were stuck in this place.

I asked my Master, wanting to be sure about the Faith that overcomes all mistakes, “Did anyone get saved by their own goodness or by someone else’s, after this?” 

He understood me and answered, “I was learning about this when I saw a Powerful One coming, wearing a crown as a sign of victory.

This One brought out the spirits of the First Parent, his son Abel, Noah, Moses the lawgiver, Abraham the patriarch, and King David.”
