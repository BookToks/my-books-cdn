At Tagliacozzo, Alardo fought without any weapons. Even though one of his limbs was pierced and another cut off, it still wouldn’t be as bad as what happens in the ninth Bolgia.

I saw a man whose body was torn apart, with his guts hanging out between his legs. His heart was showing, and there was a sack holding the waste from what he had eaten.

While I was staring at him, he looked at me and opened his chest with his hands, saying, “Look at how I’m ripped apart. This is how Mahomet is, all hurt and torn. Ali is in front of me, crying, with his face split from forehead to chin. All the others you see here caused trouble and fights when they were alive, so now they’re split like this.

There’s a devil behind us who cuts us cruelly with a sword, reopening our wounds whenever we finish the painful path. Our cuts close up again before we pass him, but he makes us bleed once more.

Then he asked me, ‘Who are you, standing there on the rock, maybe trying to avoid the pain that’s waiting for you because of your sins?’”
