The notalimb had stopped moving.

My Conductor reached out, grabbed some earth with his hands full, and threw it into the wide mouths.

It was like a dog that barks for food but gets quiet once it starts eating. The dogs try to fight back while eating, but they canâ€™t. These mouths were dirty and scary like Cerberus, the demon dog who guards the souls and makes them want to be deaf.

We walked through shadows that quieted the heavy rain storm, and we stepped carefully on the empty ground that looked like people.

They were all lying face down on the earth, except for one who sat up straight as soon as he saw us walking by.
