Some people were lying down on the ground, while others were walking around. The ones who were walking farted more, and the ones lying down suffered more but talked more about their pain.

All over the sandy area, little sparks of fire were falling slowly, like snow on a mountain without any wind.

Just like Alexander in the hot parts of India saw flames falling from the sky without stopping, he told his soldiers to stomp on the ground to put out the fire. This worked better because the fire was easier to stop when it was spread out.

So, the heat was always coming down, and the sand caught fire like dry grass under a steel blade, making the pain even worse.
