Without any more proof or even a retelling, if it weren’t for my conscience calming me, that good feeling inside that makes a person brave beneath the armor of pure emotions.

I really saw it, and I still seem to see it, a body without a head, walking like the rest of a sad group.

And by the hair, I held the severed head, hanging from my hand like a lantern, and it looked at us and said: “O me!” The head made itself like a lamp, and they were two in one, and one in two; how that works, only the one who made it knows.

When it got close to the foot of the bridge, it raised its arm and head high to bring its words closer to us, which were: “Look now at the terrible punishment, you who breathe and look upon the dead; see if any is as great as this.

And so you can carry news of me, know that I am Bertram de Born, the same one who gave the Young King bad advice. I caused the father and son to rebel against each other."
