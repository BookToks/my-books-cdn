The flame was still and quiet, ready to stop speaking and leave us, with the kind Poet’s permission. 

But then another flame appeared behind it, making us turn our eyes toward it because it made a strange noise.

It sounded like the Sicilian bull, which first bellowed sadly and painfully. Even though the sound was made from brass, it still seemed full of pain. At first, no words came clearly from the fire, only sad feelings.

Later, the words became clearer as the flame moved, using the voice to speak.

We heard it say: “Hey you, the one I’m calling to, the one who just spoke Lombard saying, ‘Go now, I won’t bother you anymore.’ I might be a little late, but don’t be annoyed if I stay and talk with you. You don’t annoy me, and I am burning here.

If you’ve only just come into this dark world...”
