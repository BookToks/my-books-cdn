I don’t know who you are, or how you got here; but you seem like someone from Florence when I hear you speak.

You should know that I was Count Ugolino.

Count Ugolino della Gherardesca was a powerful man in Pisa. For ten years, he held the highest positions in the city. He almost became the only leader, but his nephew, Nino Visconte, challenged him and forced them to share power. This didn’t last, and they made a deal where Visconte ruled Sardinia alone.

But Ugolino wasn’t happy with that. He sent his son to cause trouble on the island, which started a deadly fight between two groups called the Guelphs. The real leader behind the scenes was Archbishop Ruggieri Rubaldino. He acted like he was friends with both sides but secretly worked for his own plan.

In 1287, after some fights, both Ugolino and Visconte stepped down to keep peace. But they changed their minds and took back control with their followers. Ruggieri seemed okay with this and even stood by when Ugolino killed his favorite nephew. He hid his true feelings so well that he didn’t admit the dead man was his relative and helped Ugolino stay in power and ruin Visconte.

And this man was Archbishop Ruggieri. Now I will tell you why I am your neighbor.
