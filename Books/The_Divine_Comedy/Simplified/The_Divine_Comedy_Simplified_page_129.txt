We climbed up very easily and then turned right along the ridge. We left the endless circles behind us.

When we reached a hollow place below, which made a path for the punished souls, the Guide said, "Wait and look at the vision of those other evil people you haven’t seen yet because they left with us."

From an old bridge, we looked up at a group coming from the other side, and the punished souls there were suffering in a similar way.

Without me asking, the good Master said, "See that tall one coming? Even though he’s in pain, he doesn’t cry. He still looks proud and important.

That’s Jason, who used his heart and cleverness to take everything from the people of Colchis.

He passed by the island of Lemnos after the tough women there killed all the men.

He tricked Hypsipyle, the girl who had already fooled everyone else.

He left her pregnant and alone. Because of his sins, he deserves this punishment, and also because of what he did to Medea.

Those who trick others like him go with him. This is enough to understand the first valley and the people trapped there."
