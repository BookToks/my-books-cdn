One fake woman is the one who lied about Joseph, and the other is Sinon, the Greek from Troy. They were sent here because of a bad fever." One of them, annoyed at being called so harshly, hit his hard belly with his fist.

It made a sound like a drum. Master Adam hit him back on the face with an arm that wasn’t any softer, saying, "Even if I lose all movement because my limbs are so heavy, I still have an arm free for this." The other answered, "When you went to the fire, you weren’t ready yet, but you were ready and more when you were coming here." The swollen man replied, "You’re right about that; but you weren’t a good witness when you were questioned about the truth at Troy." "If I lied, then you faked the coin," Sinon said. "I’m here for one fault, and you for more than any other devil." 

"Remember, liar, about the horse," said the man with the big belly. "And it will be sad for you when the whole world knows." "It will be sad for you too, with your cracked tongue and the bad water that makes your belly swelling," the Greek said. Then the fake coin maker said, "Your mouth is always open, ready to say bad things. If I’m thirsty and filled with water, you have the burning and aching head. And even if you wanted to look at yourself like Narcissus, you wouldn’t need many words to invite you."
