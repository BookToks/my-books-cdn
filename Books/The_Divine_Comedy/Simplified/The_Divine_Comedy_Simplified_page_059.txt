This sad little stream flows down to the bottom of the dark, ugly shore.

I stood there, watching people covered in mud in that swamp. They were all naked and looked really angry.

They hit each other not just with their hands, but also with their heads, chests, and feet, biting and tearing each other apart.

The wise guide said, “Son, now you see the souls of those who were overcome by anger. Also, I want you to know that under the water there are people who sigh and make bubbles on the surface, wherever their eyes look.

Stuck in the mud, they say, ‘We were unhappy in the fresh air, warmed by the sun.’”
