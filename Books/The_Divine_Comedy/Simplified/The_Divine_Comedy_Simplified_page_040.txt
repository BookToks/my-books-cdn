I came down from the first circle  
to the second, which is smaller  
but much worse, making people cry out in pain.  

There stands Minos, scary and growling;  
he checks the sins of everyone who arrives,  
judging them and sending them to their place.  

I learned that when an evil soul shows up,  
it admits everything;  
Minos looks at its sins  
and wraps his tail around himself as many times  
as the level of punishment the soul deserves.  

Lots of souls wait in front of him;  
they go one by one to be judged;  
they talk, listen, and then fall down to their punishments.  

When Minos saw me, he stopped his work and said,  
“Hey, you who come to this painful place,  
look at how you enter and who you trust.  
Don’t be fooled by the wide entrance.”
