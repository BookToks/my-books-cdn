paskvil.com/ “Who is this person who respects every kind of art and science, and is honored more than all the others?” I asked. And he answered me: “It is the honorable name, whose fame lives on above in heaven, making them even greater.” 

Just then, I heard a voice say: “All honor to the greatest Poet; his shade returns, after he had gone away.” When the voice stopped and everything was quiet, I saw four powerful spirits coming toward us; they didn’t look sad or happy.

My kind Master began to explain to me: “Look at the one holding that sword in his hand, who comes before the other three, like their leader. That is Homer, the greatest poet; the next is Horace, the satirist; the third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.

Because each of these poets belongs with me, the name that the single voice gave applies to us all. They honor me, and I honor them well.” So I saw the famous group of poets gathered, led by the greatest singer, who soars above the rest like an eagle.

After they talked together for a while, they turned to me and greeted me. When my Master saw this, he smiled. They honored me even more by making me one of their group, so I became the sixth among such great minds.

We kept going toward the light, saying things that are better left unspoken, while words echoed around us in rings — “honor, honor, honor, honored, honored!”
