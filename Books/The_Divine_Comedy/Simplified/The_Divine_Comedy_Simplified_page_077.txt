Dante looked around nervously, trying to see if anyone else was with me. But when he realized no one else was there, he started crying and said, “If you’re passing through this dark prison because of your great talent, where is my son? Why isn’t he with you?”

I told him, “I’m not here by myself; someone is guiding me who maybe your friend Guido once admired.”  

I had already guessed who he was from the way he spoke and the kind of punishment he had. That’s why my answer was so full and clear.

Suddenly, he shouted, “What did you say—he *had*? Is he not still alive? Doesn’t the sweet light still shine on his eyes?”  

When he noticed I wasn’t answering right away, he fell back down and didn’t show himself again.

But the other man, who I really wanted to talk to, stayed calm and didn’t move his head or body at all.  

He continued, “If they haven’t learned the right kind of art, it causes me more pain than this bed of punishment.

But no matter how many times the Lady who rules here shows her face, you won’t feel her light again until you understand how heavy this pain is.  

And when you go back to the sweet world, tell them why these people are so cruel.”
