Inferno Canto 29

The many people and their different wounds made my eyes so tired that they wanted to stop and cry. But Virgil said, “Why are you still staring down there at those sad, hurt souls?

You didn’t do this in the other parts of Hell. Remember, if you try to count them, the valley is twenty-two miles long, and the moon is already beneath our feet. We don’t have much time, and there’s more to see than what you’re looking at.”

I answered, “If you had listened to why I was looking, maybe you would have let me stay longer.” My guide then walked away, and I followed, already starting to explain more.

I added, “In that place where I was staring so hard, I think a spirit related to me was feeling sorry for the sins that cost so much down there.”

Then my master said, “Don’t think about him anymore. Look somewhere else and leave him there. I saw him below the little bridge, pointing at you and threatening with his finger. His name was Gerï del Bello.”
