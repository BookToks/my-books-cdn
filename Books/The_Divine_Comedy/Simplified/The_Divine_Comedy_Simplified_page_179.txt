But I clearly saw Puccio Sciancato;  
And he was the only one of three companions,  
Who came at the start, and was not changed;  
The other was the one you, Gaville, cry for.  

Gaville was a village in the Valdarno area,  
Where Guercio Cavalcanti was killed.  
His family took revenge on the people there,  
In the old Italian way,  
Which made Gaville mourn the murder.
