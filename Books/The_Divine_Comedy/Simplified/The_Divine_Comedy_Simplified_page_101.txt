After Attila left ashes behind, their hard work was wasted.  

I made a noose from my own house to hang myself.  

Florence was destroyed by Totila in 450, not Attila. In Dante’s time, people often confused the two. The Ottimo Commentore says, “Some say Totila and Attila were different people; others say they were the same man.”  

Dante doesn’t say who the person who killed himself was. Boccaccio thinks it’s either because the person wanted to protect their family’s good name, or because many people in those times hanged themselves, almost like a curse from God on the city, so anyone could be the one Dante meant.
