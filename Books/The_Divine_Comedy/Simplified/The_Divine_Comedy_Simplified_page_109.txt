Now we were walking along one of the hard edges,  
and the little stream’s mist covered its shadows.  
The water saved it from the fire and the dikes.  

Just like the people from Flanders, between Cads and Bruges,  
who build strong walls to protect themselves from floods,  
and like the people from Padua along the Brenta River,  
who guard their homes and villages,  
or the ones near Chiarentana who feel the heat;  
their walls were made in a similar way,  
though not as tall or thick,  
but whoever built them was skilled.  

At that point, we were far from the forests,  
and I couldn’t have figured out where we were,  
even if I had turned around.  
Then we met a group of souls  
who came up beside the dike and stared at us,  
just like people do under a new moon at night,  
and they looked at us closely,  
like an old tailor looking through a needle’s eye.  

We were being watched carefully by that group.
