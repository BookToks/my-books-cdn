Just now, these thoughts came to me on their own, with the same attitude and face, so I made one plan from both.

If by chance the right bank slopes down to the next Bolgia, we could go down there.

We would escape from the imagined chase." But I hadn't finished saying this.

When I saw them coming without wings, not far away, ready to grab us,

My guide suddenly grabbed me, like a mother who wakes up to a noise,

And sees the fire close by, who takes her son and flies without stopping,

Caring more for him than herself, only covering him with a light cloth.

He laid me down face up from the top of the steep bank onto a hanging rock,

Which was on one side of the other Bolgia walls.

No water runs so fast through a sluice to turn a mill wheel,

As my master carried me down along the edge,

Holding me close to his chest like his own son, not just a friend.

Before his feet reached the bottom of the ravine,

We were already at the hill above us; but he wasn’t scared,

Because a higher power had decided to put the rulers of the fifth moat there.

(When he’s scared and in a hurry, and has a very steep place to go down, Virgil has to carry him completely,” says Mr. Ruskin. See Canto XII.)
