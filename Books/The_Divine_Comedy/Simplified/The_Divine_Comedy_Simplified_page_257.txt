DanteAlighieri-DivineComedy,Inferno 247 In December 1834, Longfellow received a letter from Josiah Quincy III, president of Harvard College, offering him a position as the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages with the stipulation that he spend a year or so abroad. In October 1835, during the trip, his wife Mary had a miscarriage about six months into her pregnancy. She did not recover and died after several weeks of illness at the age of 22 on November 29, 1835. Longfellow had her body embalmed immediately and placed into a leadcoffininsideanoakcoffinwhichwasthenshippedtoMountAuburn Cemetery near Boston. Three years later, he was inspired to write “FootstepsofAngels”abouttheirlove.
 
 When he returned to the United States in 1836, Longfellow took up the professorship at Harvard University. He was required to live in CambridgetobeclosetothecampusandmovedintotheCraigieHouseinthe spring of 1837.

Longfellow began publishing his poetry, including “Voices of the Night” in 1839 andBalladsandOtherPoems,whichincludedhisfamouspoem“TheVillage Blacksmith”,in1841.
 
 Courtship of Frances “Fanny” Appleton Longfellow began courting Frances “Fanny” Appleton, the daughter of a wealthy Boston industrialist, Nathan Appleton. At first, she was not interested but Longfellow was determined. In July 1839, he wrote to a friend: “victory hangs doubtful. The lady says she will not! I say she shall! It is not pride, but the madness of passion.” During the courtship, he frequently walked from Harvard to her home in Boston, crossing the BostonBridge. Thatbridgewassubsequentlydemolishedandreplacedin 1906 by a new bridge, which was eventually renamed as the Longfellow Bridge. Longfellow continued writing, however, and in the fall of 1839 publishedHyperion,abookoftravelwritingsdiscussinghistripsabroad.
