In December 1834, Longfellow got a letter from Josiah Quincy III, who was the president of Harvard College. The letter offered him a job as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages. The job required him to spend about a year living abroad. 

In October 1835, while on the trip, his wife Mary had a miscarriage when she was six months pregnant. She got very sick and didn’t get better. She died a few weeks later, on November 29, 1835, when she was only 22 years old. Longfellow had her body preserved and put in a lead coffin inside an oak coffin. Then, they sent it to Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston. Three years later, he wrote a poem called “Footsteps of Angels” about their love.

When Longfellow came back to the United States in 1836, he started his job at Harvard University. He had to live in Cambridge to be close to the school and moved into the Craigie House in the spring of 1837. The house was built in 1759 and had been George Washington’s headquarters during the siege of Boston in 1775. Longfellow began publishing his poems, including “Voices of the Night” in 1839 and “Ballads and Other Poems,” which had his famous poem “The Village Blacksmith,” in 1841.

Longfellow started dating Frances “Fanny” Appleton, whose dad, Nathan Appleton, was a rich Boston businessman. At first, Fanny wasn’t interested, but Longfellow didn’t give up. In July 1839, he wrote to a friend, “victory hangs doubtful. The lady says she will not! I say she shall! It is not pride, but the madness of passion.” While he was trying to win her over, he often walked from Harvard to her house in Boston, crossing the Boston Bridge. That bridge was later torn down and replaced in 1906 by a new bridge, which was later named the Longfellow Bridge. Longfellow kept writing and published a book called “Hyperion” in the fall of 1839 about his travels abroad.

After seven years, Fanny finally said yes, and they got married in 1843. Nathan Appleton gave them the Craigie House, which looked over the Charles River, as a wedding gift.

Longfellow’s love for Fanny shows in his only love poem, a sonnet called “The Evening Star,” written in October 1845: “O my beloved, my sweet Hesperus! My morning and my evening star of love!” He and Fanny had six children: Charles Appleton (1844-1893), Ernest Wadsworth (1845-1921), Fanny (1847-1848), Alice Mary (1850-1928), Edith...
