A black serpent appeared slowly, like a lizard moving under the hot summer sun. When a lizard crosses a path, you sometimes see a flash of lightning—that’s how this serpent showed up, small and fiery, looking dark and shiny like a peppercorn.

It came toward two others, aiming at their bellies. It stuck into one of them where food first enters the body, then fell down in front of him.

The one who got stuck just looked at it but didn’t say anything. He even yawned as if he was very tired or sick.

The hot serpent stared at him and bit him. One serpent smoked through the wound, the other through the mouth, and the smoke mixed together.

Now, be quiet, Lucan, when talking about the sad Sabellus and Nassidius, and wait to see what happens next.

Be silent, Ovid, about Cadmus and Arethusa; if he turns into a snake and she into a fountain, I don’t blame him for the story. Two different things rarely change into each other like that.

The two serpents responded so that one serpent split the other’s tail, and the injured one pulled its feet together.

The legs and thighs stuck together so well that soon you couldn’t tell where the join was.

The one with the split tail took the shape the other was losing, and its skin became soft, while the other’s skin got hard.

I saw their arms pulled in close to their armpits.

This black serpent is Guercio Cavalcanti, who changes form with Buoso degli Abati.
