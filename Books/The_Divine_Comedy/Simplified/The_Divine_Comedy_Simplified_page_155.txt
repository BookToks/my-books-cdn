Ciriatto had a tusk sticking out of his mouth, like a wild boar’s, which made the man feel like one of them could tear him apart.

The mouse had ended up among these mean cats. But Barbariccia grabbed him tightly and said, “Step aside while I stab him.” Then he turned to my Master and said, “Ask him again if you want to know more before someone kills him.”

The Guide asked, “Now tell me the names of the other bad guys. Do you know anyone from Latium hiding under the pitch?” The man answered, “I recently left someone who lived nearby. I wish I were still with him because I wouldn’t be afraid of claws or hooks!”

Libicocco said, “We’ve put up with enough.” He grabbed the man’s arm with his claws and tore at the tendon.

Draghignazzo also wanted to jump on him, aiming for his legs, but their leader looked around angrily and stopped them.

Once they calmed down a bit, my Conductor quickly asked the man, who was still looking at his wound, “Who was that unlucky one you said left to come ashore?” The man answered, “It was Friar Gomita from Gallura, a master of trickery. He held the enemies of his lord and dealt with them cruelly, as told in the songs of Bertrand de Born.”
