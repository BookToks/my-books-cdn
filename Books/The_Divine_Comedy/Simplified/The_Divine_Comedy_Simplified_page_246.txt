We climbed up, he first and I second, until I saw through a small opening some of the most beautiful things that Heaven holds. Then we came out again to look at the stars.

You’ll notice that each of the three parts of the Divine Comedy ends with the word “Stars,” which stands for endless hope and reaching for more. At the end of Inferno, Dante “looks at the stars” again; at the end of Purgatorio, he is “ready to climb to the stars”; and at the end of Paradiso, he feels the power of “that Love which moves the sun and other stars.” Now, he is looking at the morning stars on Easter Sunday.
