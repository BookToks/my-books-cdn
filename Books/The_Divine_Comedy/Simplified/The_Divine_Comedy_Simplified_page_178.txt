Both feet of the reptile, which were short, stretched out as much as the ones that were pulled in.

After that, the back feet twisted together and became the part of a man that he hides, and the poor man ended up with two of his own.

Both feet let out breath that covered them with a new color and made hair grow on one while removing hair from the other. One foot stood up while the other fell, without turning away from their strange lights, under which each one’s face changed.

The one who was standing pulled his head toward his temples, and because there was too much stuff coming there, ears formed from the hollow cheeks. What didn’t go back stayed on the face and made a nose, and the lips got thicker as needed.

The one lying down pushed his face forward and pulled his ears back into his head, like a snail pulls in its horns. The tongue, which was whole and good for talking before, split in two. The other tongue closed up, and the smoke stopped.

The soul, which had turned into a reptile, hissed along the valley and flew up, and after it, the others started to speak with a sputtering sound.

Then he turned on his new shoulders and said to the other: “I will have Buoso run, crawling like I did, along this road.” This is how I saw the seventh burden move and move again, and here I have my excuse for any new things I might have messed up.

Even though my eyes were a bit confused and my mind upset, they couldn’t secretly look away.
