Longfellow often used stories with hidden meanings in his work. In his poem “Nature,” he shows death like bedtime for a grumpy kid.

A writer named Edgar Allan Poe wrote to Longfellow in May 1841, saying he really admired his talent and later called him “the best poet in America.” But as Poe became more known as a critic, he accused Longfellow of copying other people’s ideas. This fight is known as “The Longfellow War.” Poe thought Longfellow copied especially from another poet named Alfred Tennyson.

Another writer, Margaret Fuller, said Longfellow’s work seemed fake and copied and didn’t have much power.

Poet Walt Whitman also thought Longfellow copied European styles. But he liked that Longfellow could connect with regular people and write about everyday themes in a way many could understand.

Longfellow was the most popular poet of his time. He was so famous in America that when he turned 70 in 1877, people held parades, gave speeches, and read his poems like it was a national holiday. He was one of the first big American celebrities.

His poems were loved then and still are now, though some people today think they are too emotional. His poetry talks about familiar ideas using simple and smooth language. His work helped create American stories and myths that people still know.
