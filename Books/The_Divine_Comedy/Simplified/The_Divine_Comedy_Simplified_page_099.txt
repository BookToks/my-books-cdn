Just like the guy who sees the boar and hears it coming toward his hiding spot, who hears the crashing of the animals and branches, and two people see it too! On our left side, naked and scratched, running away super fast, one of the forest creatures had broken every bone in his body.

The one who was ahead shouted, “Help, Death, help!” And the other one, who seemed too slow, was yelling, “Lano, we weren’t paying attention!”

(Lano was a young rich guy from Siena who spent all his money really fast with his rich friends. When he ran out of money, he joined some troops from Florence fighting against people from Arezzo. He got into a fight near the parish of Toppo, which Dante called a joust. Even though he could have escaped, because he hated being poor after being rich, he rushed into the fight and was killed, maybe because that’s what he wanted.)
