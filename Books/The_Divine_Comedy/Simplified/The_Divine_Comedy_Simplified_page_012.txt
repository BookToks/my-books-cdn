There was a quiet fear in my heart that had lasted all night.  
I had spent the night feeling very tired and sad.  
As someone who was struggling to breathe came out from the sea onto the shore and looked at the dangerous water,  
my soul, which was still trying to escape, also turned back to look at the path  
that no living person had ever left behind.  

After resting my tired body,  
I started walking again up the desert hill,  
making sure my feet stayed on the lower ground.  

And then, just where the climb began,  
a panther appearedâ€”light and very fast,  
covered with spotted skin!  

She never moved away from my path,  
in fact, she blocked my way so much  
that I had to turn back many times.  

It was early morning,  
and the sun was rising with the stars that were with it,  
the time when Divine Love begins.
