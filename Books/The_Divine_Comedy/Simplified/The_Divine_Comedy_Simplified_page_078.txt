I asked him, “Why are you against my people and their laws?” He answered, “The huge battles and bloodshed that stained the Arbia River made us build prisons in our temple.”  

He shook his head with a sigh and said, “I wasn’t alone there, and I didn’t join the others without a good reason.”  

“But there I was alone, while everyone else agreed to destroy Florence, the city he openly defended.”  

I said, “Ah! So now you can finally rest. Please help me understand something that’s confusing me.”  

He said, “It seems you think I can see the future clearly and have a different way of seeing things right now.”  

“We see things like people with bad eyesight see things far away. God still shines on us a lot.”  

“When the future comes closer, our minds can’t understand it at all. If no one tells us, we don’t know anything about your human life.”  

“So you need to know that when the future’s door closes, all our knowledge will end.”  

Then I felt sorry and said, “So, will you tell that fallen soul that his son is still alive?”  

(Note: This is about the Battle of Monte Aperto near the Arbia River. The Ghibellines, who were kicked out of Florence, joined with Siena and won against the Guelfs to take back the city. Before the battle, the leader of Siena gave the city’s keys to the Virgin Mary as a gift. After winning, the defeated Florentines’ flag and battle bell were tied to a donkey’s tail and dragged through the dirt.)  

(After the battle, the Ghibellines met at Empoli. The leaders from Siena and Pisa, probably because they hated Florence, wanted to destroy the city. But Farinata spoke strongly against this idea.)
