paskvil.com/ And then, after I had planned to catch the panther with the painted skin, 

I let everything go, just as my guide told me to. I reached it, grabbed it, and wrapped it up. The panther turned to its right side, 

and a little away from the edge, he threw it down into the deep abyss. 

I thought to myself, “This must be something new, some kind of signal. The Master is watching carefully.” Oh, how careful people should be 

with those who don’t just see what’s happening but understand the deeper meaning! 

He said to me: “Soon what I’m waiting for will come up; 

and what you think is just a dream will soon show itself clearly.” 

But about that truth, which sometimes looks like a lie, a person should keep quiet as much as possible, 

because talking about it can cause shame even when it’s not your fault. But here I can’t stay silent. And, Reader, by the notes of this poem I promise, 

I hope they will not be forgotten or ignored. 

The “panther with the painted skin” is seen by Lombardi as a symbol of someone trying to control their desires by wearing a special cord, like a Franciscan friar does. Even while wearing the cord, he uses it here to trick Geryon and bring him up. Biagioli thinks it means the humility needed to learn, because humility keeps pride in check. Fraticelli believes it means being watchful; Tommaseo says it’s about hoping to be honest with the Florentines but being ready for their tricks; and Gabrielli Rossetti says Dante thought he would be treated with honesty as a sincere supporter of the Ghibellines but instead faced terrible betrayal. 

Remember that St. Francis, who started the Cordeliers (the people who wear the cord), used to call his body a donkey and control it with a halter. So the cord stands for controlling animal-like desires. Lombardi’s idea makes the most sense. However, Virgil seems to have thrown the cord into the abyss just because he had nothing else to throw, not to trick anyone. 

196 As a person naturally does when throwing something.
