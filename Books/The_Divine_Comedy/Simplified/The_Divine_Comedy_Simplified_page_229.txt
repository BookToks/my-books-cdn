“I’m alive, and I care about it,” I answered, “if you want to be famous, I’ll put your name among the others.”  

But he said to me, “I want the opposite. Get away from me and stop bothering me. You’ll only hear lies in this place.”  

Then I grabbed him by the back of his head and said, “You have to tell me who you are, or I’ll pull out all your hair.”  

He said, “Even if you pull out all my hair, I won’t tell you who I am or show you, no matter how many times you try.”  

I was already twisting his hair and had pulled out more than one bunch. He kept barking, looking down at the ground, when someone else shouted, “What’s wrong with you, Bocca?”
