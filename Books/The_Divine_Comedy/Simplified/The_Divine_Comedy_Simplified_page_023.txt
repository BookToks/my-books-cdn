After she spoke to me, crying with shining eyes, she looked away. Because of her, I hurried on my way. And I came to you, just like she wanted. I have saved you from that wild beast that was blocking the easy path up the beautiful mountain.

So, what is it? Why are you waiting? Why is there such fear in your heart?

Why aren’t you brave and strong, when three kind ladies in Heaven are watching out for you? And my words promise you good things.

Just like flowers that close up at night because of cold, but open wide when the sun shines, I found new strength in my tired body. My heart felt courage again, and I started to speak boldly:

“Oh kind lady, who helped me, and you, who listened so quickly to her truthful words!

You have my heart ready to take the risk, because of what you said. I have gone back to my first plan.

Now go, because we both share the same will — you are my leader, my lord, and my master.” I said this to him; and when he moved, I began the hard and wild journey.
