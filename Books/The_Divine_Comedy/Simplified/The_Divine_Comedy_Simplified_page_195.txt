More than a hundred people were there when they heard him. He stood still in the moat, looking at me, amazed and not noticing their suffering.

Now say to Fra Dolcino to get ready. You, who might soon see the sun, if you want him not to follow me, take supplies so the snow won’t make it easier for the Novarese to win. It wouldn’t be easy for them otherwise. After walking one more step, he said these words to me, then stretched out on the ground to leave.

Another person, who had his throat pierced and his nose cut off just under his eyebrows, and only had one ear left, stayed to look around in wonder with the others. Then the others opened his throat, which was red all over, and he said: “Oh you, who don’t blame the guilty, and whom I once saw in Latian land, unless I’m too fooled by how alike you seem, remember Pier da Medicina.” 

Fra Dolcino was one of the first social and religious reformers in northern Italy. His group was called the “Apostles,” and their main belief was to bring the Church back to the simple ways of the apostles.  

In 1305, he and his followers went to the mountains near Val Sesia in Piedmont. The Church fought against them, and after many battles, snow and hunger weakened them. Fra Dolcino and his companion, the beautiful Margaret of Trent, were captured and burned at Vercelli on June 1, 1307.

Val Sesia, where Fra Dolcino was caught, is in the area ruled by Novara.

Pier da Medicina was a man from Bologna who caused fights among the citizens.
