And I said to him: “Even though I come, I do not stay; but who are you, looking so dirty?” He answered, “You see, I am someone who weeps.”

And I said to him: “With weeping and crying, your spirit is cursed and stays here; I know you, even though you are all dirty.” Then he stretched out both his hands toward the boat; my careful Master pushed him back, saying, “Get away with the other dogs!”

After that, he wrapped his arms around my neck; he kissed my face and said, “You proud soul, blessed is she who carried you in her womb.

That was a proud person in the world; no goodness is in his memory; so here his spirit is angry.

Many great kings are honored above, but here they will be like pigs in the mud, leaving behind horrible bad reputations!”

And I said, “My Master, I would be very happy if I could see him soaked in this mess before we leave the lake.” And he said to me: “Before we go to the shore, you will be satisfied; I want you to enjoy seeing this.”

A little later, I saw how the people in the mud made a mess of him, and I still thank my God for it.

They were all shouting, “At Philippo Argenti!”
