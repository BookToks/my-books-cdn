From one bridge to another, we talked about different things, not the ones my story cares about.  

We kept walking and reached the top, where we stopped to look at another crack in the ground. It was part of Malebolge, and I saw people crying out in pain. The place was really dark.  

It was like a shipyard in Venice during winter, where workers boil sticky pitch to fix old boats that can’t sail anymore. One person makes new boats, another patches up the ribs of old ones that have been used a lot. Some hammer the front, others the back, some make oars, and others twist ropes or fix the sails.  

Down below, instead of fire, the pitch was boiling because of some strange power, and it covered the sides of the banks.  

I saw the bubbles from the boiling pitch but couldn’t see what was inside it, only the bubbles rising and falling again.  

While I stared carefully, my guide suddenly shouted, “Watch out, watch out!” and pulled me closer to him from where I was standing.
