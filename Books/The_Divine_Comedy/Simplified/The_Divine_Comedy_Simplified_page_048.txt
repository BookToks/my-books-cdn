When I woke up, I was still feeling sad because of what had happened to those two people. But then I saw new kinds of pain and suffering all around me, no matter where I looked or went.

I was in the third circle, where it was always raining. The rain was cold, heavy, and unpleasant, and this never changed.

Huge hail, dark water, and snow poured down through the dark air. The noise of the rain was terrible on the earth that caught it.

There was a cruel monster named Cerberus with three dog-like mouths barking over the people who were stuck in the mud.

He had red eyes, a greasy black beard, a big belly, and sharp claws on his hands. He would tear the spirits apart and hurt them badly.

The rain made the poor souls act like wild dogs. They tried to protect each other from the storm, but often they just turned against one another.

When Cerberus saw us coming, the big monster opened his mouth and showed his sharp teeth.
