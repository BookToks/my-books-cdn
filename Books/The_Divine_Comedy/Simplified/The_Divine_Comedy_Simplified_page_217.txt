We turned our backs on the awful valley,  
Onto the hill that goes all around it,  
Crossing it without saying a word.  

It was neither night nor day,  
So I couldn’t see very far ahead;  
But I heard a loud horn blowing,  
So loud it made the thunder seem quiet,  
And I focused all my eyes on one spot.  

After the sad defeat  
When Charlemagne’s holy army was lost,  
Orlando didn’t sound that terrible.  

For a short time, I kept looking that way  
When I thought I saw many tall towers,  
So I said, “Master, what town is this?”  
And he said, “Because you’re looking so far through the darkness,  
You’re just imagining things.”
