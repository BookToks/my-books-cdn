That feeling of fear showed on me when I saw my guide suddenly stop and turn around. He quickly tried to hide it.

He stood still and listened carefully, like someone trying to hear in the dark fog ahead.

He said, “We still have to keep fighting, or else... someone will come to help us soon!” I noticed right away that he didn’t say exactly what he meant next. His words scared me because I guessed something worse than what he said.

I asked, “Has anyone ever gone down this far, where there’s no hope left because of the pain?” He answered, “Very few have made this journey.”

He told me that only once before had someone been sent down here by a cruel witch named Erictho, who brought dead souls back to their bodies.
