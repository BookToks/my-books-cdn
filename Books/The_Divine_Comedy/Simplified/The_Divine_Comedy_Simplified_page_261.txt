Doré mostly worked with wood engraving and steel engraving.

Doré was born in Strasbourg. He published his first illustrated story when he was just fifteen. Later, he started working as a book illustrator in Paris.

Doré was hired to illustrate books by famous writers like Rabelais, Balzac, Milton, and Dante.

In 1853, Doré was asked to create pictures for Lord Byron’s works. After that, he did more projects for British publishers, including an illustrated English Bible. He also illustrated a big edition of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven,” which earned him 30,000 francs from the publisher Harper and Brothers in 1883.

Doré’s English Bible, published in 1866, was very popular. In 1867, he had a big show of his work in London. This show led to the opening of the Doré Gallery on New Bond Street. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold, whose father was Douglas William Jerrold, suggested they work together on a big project about London. Jerrold got the idea from an earlier book called The Microcosm of London, made in 1808. Doré signed a five-year deal with the publishers Grant & Co. He had to live in London for three months each year and was paid £10,000 a year for his work.

The book, London: A Pilgrimage, with 180 pictures, came out in 1872. It sold well, but many critics didn’t like it. Some were upset because Doré seemed to focus a lot on the poor parts of London. The Art Journal said he was “making things up instead of copying.” The Westminster Review said Doré showed the ugliest and most common parts of the city. Despite this, the book was still a financial success.
