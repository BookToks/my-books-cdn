Count Ugolino was famous for being betrayed in his castle.  
You shouldn’t blame him for what happened.  
He was innocent, like the city of Thebes, which is known for its bad luck and tragic stories.

Uguccione and Brigata were young, and their story shows how well a poet can describe a journey.  
Napier wrote that Ugolino gave up some important places to Florence without hesitation. He kicked out his enemies and made Pisa a city that supported Florence. People said he was a traitor, but he was actually helping himself by keeping many of his people captive and getting rid of his opponents.

Thebes had many troubles, from the story of dragon’s teeth being planted by Cadmus to the city’s destruction by Alexander, who ordered it torn down except for the house where the poet Pindar was born.  
Also, Pisa was said to be started by Pelops, the son of King Tantalus from Thebes, though its name came from another place called Olympic Pisa by the river Alpheus.
