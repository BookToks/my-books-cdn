Inferno Canto 17

“Look at the monster with the pointed tail,  
Who breaks hills, walls, and weapons.  
Look at the one who spreads trouble everywhere.”  
My Guide said this and called him to come to the shore,  
Near the edge of the worn marble path.  

The dirty, tricky creature came up and showed its head and chest,  
But it didn’t drag its tail on the ground.  

Its face looked like a fair man’s face,  
And it seemed calm on the outside,  
But its body was like a huge snake.  

It had two paws covered in hair up to the armpits;  
Its back, chest, and sides were decorated  
With ropes and shields.  

The colors and patterns were so detailed,  
No one from Tartars or Turks  
Made cloth like that,  
And no spider ever wove such fabric.  

Sometimes boats rest on the shore,  
Part in the water, part on the land.  
Just like a beaver gets ready to fight,  
That terrible monster lay on the border,  
Which was made of stone and blocked the sand.
