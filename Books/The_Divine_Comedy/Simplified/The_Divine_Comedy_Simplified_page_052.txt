Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca, along with others who focused on doing good things, tell me where they are so I can recognize them. They really want to know if Heaven makes people happy or if Hell just makes them suffer.

He said, “They are some of the darkest souls. Different sins push them down to the very bottom. If you go that far down, you can see them.”

But when you go back to the sweet world above, please tell others about what you saw. I won’t say more, and I won’t answer any more questions.” Then he looked at me straight for a moment, glanced away, bowed his head, and fell down like the other blind souls.

Then my guide said, “He won’t wake up again. This side is where you hear the sound of the angel’s trumpet. When the terrible Judge comes, everyone will leave their sad graves, get their bodies and shapes back, and hear what echoes through all of eternity.” 

So we kept walking slowly through the dirty mix of shadows and rain, touching a little on what the next life will be like.

That’s why I asked, “Master, will these punishments get worse after the big Judgment? Or will they be less, or stay as painful as they are now?”

He answered, “Go back to what you know from your studies. It says that the more perfect something is, the more it feels both pleasure and pain.

Even though these people are cursed and can never reach true perfection, later on, they will seem more real than they do now.”
