At first, those beautiful things started moving;  
They gave me some hope,  
Like the colorful skin of that wild animal,  
The time of day, and the nice season;  
But not enough to stop me from feeling scared  
Of the lionâ€™s look that I saw.  

He looked like he was coming straight at me,  
With his head held high and really hungry,  
So much that it felt like even the air was afraid of him;  
And like a wolf, always hungry,  
That looked very thin and weak,  
And had made many people feel hopeless!
