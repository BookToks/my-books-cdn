I don’t think Maremma has as many snakes as he had all along his back, starting from where our faces begin.

On his shoulders, just behind his neck, there was a dragon with its wings spread wide. It set fire to everything it met.

My master said, “That one is Cacus, who under a rock on Mount Aventine often made a lake of blood.

He doesn’t travel the same road as his brothers because of the trick he played when he stole part of the herd near him. His bad actions stopped when Hercules hit him with his mace, maybe giving him a hundred blows, but Cacus didn’t feel them.” While he was saying this, three spirits passed under us.

I didn’t know them, nor did my leader, until suddenly they shouted, “Who are you?” Because of this, our story stopped, and we focused only on them.

I didn’t know who they were, but as sometimes happens by chance, one had to name the other, shouting, “Where could Cianfa have gone?” So I pointed upwards from my chin to my nose so that the leader would notice.

Cacus was a famous giant who lived in a cave on Mount Aventine and stole part of the herd that Hercules had brought to Italy.

Dante made Cacus a centaur and separated him from the others because he was both a cheat and violent. Virgil calls him just a monster, half man, half beast.

The three spirits were Agnello Brunelleschi, Buoso degli Abati, and Puccio Sciancato.

The story about Cacus, which Virgil was telling.

Cianfa Donati was a nobleman from Florence. He appeared right away as a six-foot serpent and attacked Agnello Brunelleschi.
