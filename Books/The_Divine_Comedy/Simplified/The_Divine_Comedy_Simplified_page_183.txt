Ulysses and Diomed are punished together because of their tricky and angry actions.

Inside their flames, they cry about the trick with the wooden horse that opened the gate for the Romans’ ancestors. That trick is what caused Troy to fall. Deidamia still feels sad about Achilles, and they also suffer because of the stolen Palladium statue that protected the city.

I asked my guide, “If those flames can talk, please let them speak. I really want to hear them. Please don’t say no until the flames get closer. You see how much I want this.”

He answered, “Your request is good, so I agree. But be careful not to interrupt. Let me talk because I understand what you want; they might not like hearing you speak since they were Greeks.”

When the flame got close enough, my guide spoke at the right moment like this:

“Hey, you two who share one flame, if I deserved any respect from you when I was alive, or even a little, because I wrote great poems…”
