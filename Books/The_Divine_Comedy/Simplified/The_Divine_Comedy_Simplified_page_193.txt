Who could ever, even with free and clear words,  
Tell all about the blood and wounds I saw so many times?  

Every language would definitely fall short  
Because our speech and memory canâ€™t hold so much.  

If all the people who once mourned their fate  
In Apulia for their blood shed by the Romans and long wars  
That made such famous spoils, as Livy wrote without mistake,  
And those who fought hard against Robert Guiscard,  
And all the rest whose bones are still gathered  
At Ceperano, where the traitors are buried.
