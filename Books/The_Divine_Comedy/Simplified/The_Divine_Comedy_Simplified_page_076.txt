I came from one of the tombs and got closer to my Leader because I was a little scared.

Then he said to me, “Turn around, what are you doing? Look, there is Farinata who has risen up; you will see him from the waist up.” I was already looking at him, and he stood up straight like he was very angry.

My Leader pushed me between the tombs toward Farinata and said, “Ask your questions clearly.” When I got to the foot of his tomb, he looked at me a little like he was annoyed and asked, “Who were your ancestors?” I wanted to answer, so I told him everything. He raised his eyebrows a little.

Then he said, “My family and party have always been against you and yours. I have even chased you away many times.” I told him, “If your people banished us, we came back every time, but your side never got the upper hand.” Then a shadow appeared beside him, uncovered down to the chin; I think he got up on his knees.

Farinata was a brave and famous leader of the Ghibellines in Florence. He believed that the soul dies with the body and that happiness comes from enjoying life’s pleasures. Unlike Epicurus, he liked eating good food anytime, not just after fasting. Because of this, he is punished as a heretic here. He led the Ghibellines in a big battle in 1260, where they defeated the Guelfs and drove them out of Florence. He died in 1264.

Dante and his family were Guelfs, but Dante didn’t become a Ghibelline until after he was banished.

The shadow beside Farinata was Cavalcante de’ Cavalcanti, father of Dante’s friend Guido. He was a Guelf, so there are both Guelfs and Ghibellines buried in the same tomb.
