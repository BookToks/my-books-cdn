Before we got to the bottom of that tall tower, we looked up to the top because we saw two little flames there. Far away, another fire answered them, but it was so far that it was hard to see with the eyes.

Then I looked out over the whole sea and asked, “What is that fire saying, and what is the other one answering? Who made those fires?” And someone said to me, “Across the rough waves, you can now see what you expected, if the swamp didn’t hide it.”

No arrow ever flew faster through the air than a small boat I saw coming over the water toward us. It was guided by one pilot who shouted, “Have you arrived, lost soul?” 

“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, you shout in vain.”
