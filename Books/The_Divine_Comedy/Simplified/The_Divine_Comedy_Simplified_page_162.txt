We found people painted below us, walking very slowly. They looked tired, sad, and defeated.

They wore cloaks with hoods pulled down over their eyes. These cloaks were made in Cologne for monks. On the outside, the cloaks were shiny and bright, but inside they were heavy like lead. Frederick used to add straw to make them a bit lighter. These cloaks were always tiring to wear.

We turned left again to stay with them, listening to their sad complaints. Because they were so heavy, these tired people moved very slowly. We had to move carefully so we could stay with them.

I said to my guide, “Do you see anyone here who looks familiar, someone I might know by name or deed?” Someone behind us who understood Tuscan spoke up and said, “Stop walking, you who rush through this dark air! Maybe I can give you what you want.”

My guide stopped and said, “Wait here, and then we will go at his pace.” I stayed still to see how quickly he would come.

The story goes that Emperor Frederick II punished traitors by wrapping them in lead and throwing them into a hot pot. There’s no real proof for this, just tradition. The same story is told in Scotland in a ballad about “Lord Soulis,” where he was wrapped in lead and thrown into a fiery pot to be melted.

We also see this punishment mentioned in old texts where someone says, “If the Pope knew how you live, he would have you killed in a lead cloak.”

The faces of these people showed their pain, but their heavy cloaks and the narrow path made them slow.
