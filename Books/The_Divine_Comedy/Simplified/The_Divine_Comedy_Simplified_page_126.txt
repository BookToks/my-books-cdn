There is a place in Hell called Malebolge. It is made completely of stone and looks like iron. It is shaped like a circle that goes all the way around.

Right in the middle of this bad place, there is a very wide and deep well. The story will explain where this well is.

Around the well, there is a round area between the well and the bottom of a tall, hard wall. This area has some valleys at the bottom.

Just like castles have moats for protection, this place has many moats and ditches. These form shapes, and there are small bridges from the gates of the castles to the outer walls. From the base of the cliffs, rocks stick out and cross the ditches and moats, leading to the well that collects everything.

We arrived in this place, coming down the back of Geryon. The Poet stayed on the left, and I walked behind him.

On my right, I saw new kinds of suffering, new punishments, and new people controlling the punishments.

The Eighth Circle of Hell is called Malebolge, which means Evil Pockets. It has ten stone ditches separated by walls, with rough bridges crossing them like spokes on a wheel. In the first ditch, seducers are punished, and in the second, flatterers suffer.
