And I said to the Guide: "Tell him not to move, and ask what crime brought him down here, because I have never seen a man so full of anger and violence."  

The sinner, who heard me, didn’t hide anything. He looked straight at me, and his face showed a sad shame.  

Then he said: "It hurts me more that you caught me in this misery than when I was taken from the living world.  

I can’t deny what you ask. I was punished because I stole the beautiful decorations from the church, and once someone else was blamed for it. But so you don’t have to see this, if you ever get out of these dark places, listen carefully to what I say:  

Pistoia was the first place where the Neri (Black) party grew weak; then Florence started to rebuild its people and ways. Mars will send a storm from Val di Magra, which is surrounded by dark clouds. There will be a fierce battle over Campo Piceno, and when it breaks apart suddenly, many Biancos (White party) will be hurt.  

I’ve told you this, even if it may cause you pain."  

The Neri party was kicked out of Pistoia in 1301, and the Bianchi party was banished from Florence in 1302.  

The storm from Val di Magra means Marquis Malaspini, who will gather the banished Neri from Pistoia to fight against the Bianchi at Campo Piceno, an old battlefield.  

Since Dante supported the Bianchi party, this prediction of disaster and defeat was painful for him.
