The heavens were made and given guides to lead them.  
Every part shines and shares light equally.  
Like a ruler to ordinary things, she was set to guide and manage.  
She can change empty treasures from one group to another, beyond what human wisdom can stop.  

Because of her, one group succeeds while another struggles, following her secret plan, hidden like a snake in the grass.  

No knowledge can beat her. She plans, judges, and controls like the other gods.  

She never stops changing things; necessity makes her act quickly.  
Often, the one whose time has come will rise.  

She is the one who is hurt even by those who should praise her, wrongly blaming her and giving her a bad name.  

But she is happy and doesnâ€™t hear this.  
Among other ancient beings, she happily turns her sphere and rejoices.  

Now, let's go down to a worse place.  
Every star that was rising has already set when I began, and waiting is not allowed.  
We crossed a circle to the other side, near a spring that boils and pours out along a small valley.  

The water was darker than purple.  
We moved with the dark waves, drawn down a rough path.  

A marsh is made here, which is called the Styx.
