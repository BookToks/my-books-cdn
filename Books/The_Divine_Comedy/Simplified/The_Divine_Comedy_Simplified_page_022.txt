In the sky, there are smaller circles,  
and you told me to follow your command.  
If it were already done, we wouldn’t need to talk more,  
and you wouldn’t have to open yourself to my wish.

But tell me why you don’t avoid  
coming down to this place,  
when you burn to return to that big place above.  
Since you want to understand inside,  
I’ll explain quickly why I’m not afraid to enter here.

You should only be afraid of things  
that can really hurt others.  
The rest aren’t scary because they can’t harm anyone.

God was kind enough to make me  
so your sadness doesn’t reach me,  
and no fire here can hurt me.  
A kind Lady in Heaven feels sad  
about this problem, and I will send you to her,  
so her strict judgment can be softened.

You should ask her for help.  
She said, “Your faithful one needs you now,  
and I trust him to you.”  
Lucia, who fights against all cruelty,  
quickly went to the place  
where I was sitting with the old Rachel.

“Beatrice,” she said, “the true praise of God,  
why don’t you help him,  
the one who loved you so much,  
the one who left the common people for you?  
Don’t you feel sorry for his suffering?  
Don’t you see the death fighting him  
beside that dangerous flood,  
where the ocean is wild and scary?”

People in the world have never worked so fast  
to help themselves and escape their pain  
as I did, after hearing these words.  
I came down from my blessed seat,  
trusting your noble words,  
which honor you and those who listened.
