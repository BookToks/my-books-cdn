Of angels who never rebelled,  
Nor stayed faithful to God, but only cared about themselves.  

Heaven kicked them out, not to be less fair;  
Nor does the deep abyss want them either,  
Because the damned wouldn’t get any glory from them.”  
And I asked, “Master, what’s so bad  
That makes them cry out so much?”  
He answered, “I’ll explain quickly.  

They have no hope of dying anymore;  
And their blind life is so low,  
They are jealous of every other fate.  

The world won’t let them have any fame;  
Both mercy and justice hate them.  

Let’s not talk about them, just look and move on.”  
So I looked again and saw a banner,  

Which was spinning so fast,  
It seemed like it never stopped;  
Behind it came a long line of people,  
More than I ever thought death had taken.  

I recognized some of them.  

I looked and saw the shadow of the one  
Who made the great refusal out of fear.  
Right away I understood and knew  
This group was full of miserable cowards  
Who hated God and his enemies.  

These bad people, who were never really alive,  
Were naked and painfully stung  
By gadflies and hornets that were there.  

These bugs made their faces bleed,  
And their tears mixed with the blood,  
Falling to the ground where disgusting worms gathered it up.  

And when I looked further, I was amazed.  

I saw people by a big river’s bank;  
So I said, “Master, now please tell me,  

(This restless flag shows how unstable and changeable the minds of its followers are.)  

(It’s usually thought to be Pope Celestine V.)”
