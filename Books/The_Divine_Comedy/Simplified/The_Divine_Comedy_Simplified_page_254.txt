Dante died in 1321 when he was 56 years old while he was coming back to Ravenna from a trip to Venice. He might have caught malaria there. He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore, which was later called San Francesco. In 1483, a man named Bernardo Bembo, who was in charge of Venice, made sure Dante’s remains had a better tomb.

On Dante’s grave, there are some verses written by his friend Bernardo Canaccio, dedicated to Florence, Dante’s hometown. The verses say Florence is a “mother of little love.” Later, Florence felt sorry for sending Dante away and asked many times to bring his body back. But the people in Ravenna wouldn’t let them. They even hid his bones inside a fake wall in the monastery.

Still, in 1829, a tomb was built for Dante in Florence at the Santa Croce church. But the tomb has been empty because Dante’s body stayed in Ravenna, far from the place he loved. The front of the tomb in Florence says “Honour the most exalted poet.” This is a quote from Dante’s Inferno, where the poet Virgil welcomes Dante back among the great ancient poets in Limbo. The rest of the line, which talks about his spirit returning, is missing from the empty tomb.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was an American poet born in 1807 and died in 1882. He wrote poems like “Paul Revere’s Ride,” “A Psalm of Life,” “The Song of Hiawatha,” “Evangeline,” and “Christmas Bells.”
