"Let it be, if you understand me." Then I stood up, feeling better and breathing easier than before, and said, "Go on, because I am strong and brave." 

We climbed up the rocky path, which was jagged, narrow, and really hard to walk on, even steeper than before.

While walking, I talked so I wouldn’t seem tired. Then I heard a voice from the next moat. It wasn’t clear what the words were.

I didn’t understand what it said, even though I was near the arch that goes over there. But the person speaking seemed angry. I looked down, but I couldn’t see the bottom because it was too dark. So I said, “Master, you’ve reached the next level, so let’s go down the wall. I can hear things, but I don’t understand, and I can’t see anything below.”

He replied, “I won’t answer you with words, only with actions. When you ask politely, you should follow it up with silent deeds.”

We went down from the bridge where it connected to the eighth bank. That’s when I saw the Bolgia clearly.

There was a terrifying crowd of snakes, so scary that just remembering them still makes my blood freeze. Let Libya stop bragging about her snakes.

If she has creatures like Chelydri, Jaculi, Pharae, Cenchri, and Ammhisbaena, she can’t compare to what I saw.

Neither Ethiopia nor the Red Sea has as many deadly or harmful creatures as this place.

Among this cruel and awful crowd...
