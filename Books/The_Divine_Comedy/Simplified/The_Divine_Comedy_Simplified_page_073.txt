Dante Alighieriâ€™s Divine Comedy, Inferno 63 shows a picture of the three angry Furies covered in blood.  

These Furies are scary creatures from ancient myths who punish people for their sins.  

In the story, they represent fear and punishment in the underworld.  

Their bloodstained appearance makes them look even more terrifying and powerful.
