They are in the well, all around the edge, from the top down, every single one.”

Like when fog starts to clear little by little and you begin to see what was hidden, as I looked closer toward the edge, my mistake disappeared and fear took over me. Because on the round walls, Montereggione crowns itself with towers, and around the well’s edge, half of these giants’ bodies stuck out.

I could already see the face, shoulders, chest, most of the belly, and both arms down their sides.

Nature really did a good job when she made these creatures, as if she took workers from Mars. And if she doesn’t regret making elephants and whales, anyone who looks closely will think she didn’t either. Because when intelligence is combined with evil will and power, no group of people can easily fight against it.

Montereggione is an old, pretty castle near Siena. It’s known for having towers all around but none in the middle. Its current state still looks much like how it’s described in the poem.

The edge, which was like an apron hanging down from the middle, showed so much of him above it that three strong Frieslanders had bragged in vain to reach his hair. I saw about thirty big palm-lengths of him below where his belt would be for a man.
