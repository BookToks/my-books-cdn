Some good stars, or better things, have given me good luck, and I don’t mind it.  

There are as many glowing bugs as the deer resting on the hill when the one who lights the world shows his face clearly to us. While the fly moves away to let the gnat take its place, I see the glow-worms down in the valley, maybe where someone is farming and making wine.  

The eighth pit was shining with many flames as I realized where I was, deep down.  

Just like someone who was saved by bears and saw Elijah’s chariot leaving, he couldn’t keep his eyes on the horses going straight up to heaven. He could only see flames, like a little cloud rising up.  

Each flame in the deep trench was moving because no one admits to stealing, and every flame hides a thief inside.  

I stood on the bridge to see better, and if I hadn’t grabbed a rock, I would have fallen down without anyone pushing me.  

My guide saw me looking so closely and said, “The spirits are inside the fire; each one wraps themselves in the flame they burn with.”  

I answered, “Master, hearing you makes me more sure. I already guessed it might be this way, and I wanted to ask who is inside the fire that is split at the top, like it’s rising from a funeral fire where Eteocles and his brother were placed.”  

He told me, “Inside are the tormented...  

Eteocles and Polynices, the two sons of Oedipus, hated each other so much that after they died, their bodies were burned on the same funeral fire, but the flames moved apart and the ashes separated.”
