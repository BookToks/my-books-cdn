There was a person who had a bad disease that made his nails turn blue, and he was shaking all over while looking at a ghost.

I felt the same way when I heard those words, but shame made me strong, like a good servant facing a tough master.

I sat down on the giant’s huge shoulders. I wanted to say something, but no sound came out. I thought, “Be careful and hold me tight.”

The giant, who had saved me before when I was in danger, wrapped his arms around me to hold me up. Then he said, “Geryon, get moving now. The circles are big, but the trip down is short. Remember the new weight you’re carrying.”

Just like a small boat pushes off from the shore and moves backward, the giant slowly pulled away. When he was floating, he turned his tail like an eel and used his paws to pull the air toward himself.

I don’t think there was ever a greater fear than mine. Not when Phaeton lost control of the sun chariot, burning the sky. Not when Icarus felt his wings melt and fall, his father shouting, “You’re going to get hurt!”

My fear was worse when I realized I was up in the air, surrounded by nothing but the monster, and I couldn’t see anything else.

The giant went forward, swimming slowly down. I could only feel the wind on my face and under me as he moved.

I already heard the whirlpool crashing horribly on our right side below us.
