He met with one Don Michael Zanche of Logodoro; and in Sardinia, they never got tired of gossiping.

“Hey! Look at that one, how he grinds his teeth; I would say more, but I’m afraid he might scratch my itch if I do.” And the grand Provost turned to Farfarello, who rolled his eyes as if ready to strike, and said: “Stand aside, you nasty bird.”

“If you want to see or hear,” the scared one began again, “Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.

But let the Malebranche stop a little, so they don’t fear revenge, and I, sitting right here, will make seven come when I whistle, as we always do when one of us comes out.” Cagnazzo, at these words, lifted his snout, shook his head, and said: “Just listen to the trick he’s thought of, ready to throw himself down!

He, who has many traps, replied: “I am too clever when I bring greater sadness for myself.” Alichin couldn’t hold back, and running against the others said: “If you dive, I won’t follow you fast, but I will beat my wings above the pitch; leave the height and let the bank be a shield.”

Don Michael Zanche was the Seneschal of King Enzo of Sardinia, a natural son of Emperor Frederick II. Dante calls him Don, a title still used in Sardinia for Signore.

After King Enzo died in prison at Bologna in 1271, Don Michael tricked and flattered Enzo’s widow, Adelasia, and became Lord of Logodoro, the northwestern area next to Gallura.
