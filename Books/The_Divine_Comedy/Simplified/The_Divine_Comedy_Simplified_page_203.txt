At that time, you were stopped by the man who used to control Altaforte. You didn’t act like that, so he left.  

“O my guide,” I said, “his own violent death, which hasn’t been punished yet, made him angry and proud. I think he left without talking to me, and that made me feel sorry for him even more.”  

That’s what we talked about as far as the first place on the cliff, which the next valley shows down below, if there was more light.  

When we were right above the last prison of Malebolge, so the prisoners could show themselves to us, many cries of pain went straight through me. They were full of suffering, and I covered my ears with my hands.  

Imagine the pain if all the diseases from the hospitals of Valdichiana, between July and September, and from Maremma and Sardinia, were all gathered in one place.  

The Valdichiana, near Arezzo, was a swampy and disease-filled area in Dante’s time. Now, after drainage, it’s one of the most beautiful and fertile valleys in Tuscany.  

The Maremma was and still is known for being unhealthy, and Sardinia also had a bad reputation for sickness.
