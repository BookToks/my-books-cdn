I stood there completely confused, not knowing what to do.

I think he thought I might believe that many voices came from those tree trunks, from people hiding from us. So the Master said, “If you break off some small branch from any of these trees, your thoughts will be wasted.”

Then I reached out my hand a little and plucked a branch from a big thorn tree. The tree cried out, “Why are you hurting me?” After it was stained with blood, it cried again, “Why do you hurt me? Don’t you have any mercy?”

“We were once men, but now we are changed into trees. Your hand should be more kind, even if we were once like snakes.”

The branch I broke was like a green stick on fire at one end, and from the other end, drops of blood fell and hissed with the escaping wind. From that broken piece came both words and blood. I dropped the branch and stood there, scared.

“My wise teacher answered, ‘If he had believed sooner, poor wounded soul, he would have seen only my words and not reached out his hand. But what he did forced me to act in a way that makes me sad.

Tell him who you were, so that by fixing your name, he may remember and bring your story back to the world where he can return.’”

Then the tree said, “Your kind words please me, and I can’t stay silent; don’t be upset that I want to say a little.

I am the one who had the keys to keep safe.”
