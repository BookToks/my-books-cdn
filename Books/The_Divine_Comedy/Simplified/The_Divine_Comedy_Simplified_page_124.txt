When I stuck my head out and looked down, I felt even more scared of the deep hole.  

I saw fires and heard people crying, which made me shake and hold on even tighter.  

Then I saw terrible things turning and coming closer from all sides, things I hadn’t noticed before.  

It was like a tired falcon that has been flying for a long time. The falcon doesn’t see its prey or the bait, so it feels worn out. After flying many circles, it lands far from its owner, feeling upset and proud.  

In the same way, Geryon put us down at the bottom, near the rough rocks. After we got off, he flew away quickly like an arrow shot from a bow.
