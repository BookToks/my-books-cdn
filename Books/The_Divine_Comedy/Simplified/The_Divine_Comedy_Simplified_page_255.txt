He also made the first American translation of Dante Alighieri’s “Divine Comedy” and was one of five poets called the Fireside Poets. Longfellow was born and grew up near Portland, Maine. He started college early at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. After traveling abroad a few times, Longfellow lived the last forty-five years of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Longfellow was born on February 27, 1807, to Stephen and Zilpah Longfellow in Portland, Maine. He grew up in the house now called the Wadsworth-Longfellow House. His dad was a lawyer, and his mom’s dad, Peleg Wadsworth, was a general in the American Revolutionary War. He was named after his uncle Henry Wadsworth, a Navy officer who died three years before he was born.

Henry had brothers and sisters named Stephen, Elizabeth, Anne, Alexander, Mary, Ellen, and Samuel. When he was just three years old, Henry started going to a school for girls. By age six, he was at the private Portland Academy. While there, he worked hard and learned to speak Latin well. He printed his first poem, called “The Battle of Lovell’s Pond,” in the Portland Gazette on November 17, 1820. He stayed at Portland Academy until he was fourteen.

In the fall of 1822, 15-year-old Longfellow started at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, with his brother Stephen. His grandfather helped start the college, and his dad was on the board.
