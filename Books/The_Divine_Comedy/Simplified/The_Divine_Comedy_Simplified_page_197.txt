That traitor, who can only see with one eye,  
and controls the land near here,  
wants to meet with them and talk.  
He’ll make sure they don’t need to pray or promise to survive the dangerous winds near Focara.  

I said to him, “Show me and tell me,  
if you want me to hear the news,  
who is this person with the bitter look?”  

Then he put his hand on the jaw of one of his friends,  
and opened his mouth, crying out, “This is him, but he doesn’t speak.  

This one was banished but still believes in Caesar,  
always ready for war,  
even if it causes harm by waiting too long.”  

I was shocked to see him,  
his tongue cut in his throat—  
Curio, who was once so bold when he spoke!  

Then another man, who had both his hands cut off,  
lifted his stumps through the dark air,  
his face covered in blood, and shouted:  
“Remember Mosca too,  
who sadly said, ‘Once something is done, it’s finished!’  
That was a bad thing for the people of Tuscany.”  

I added, “And death for your race,”  
and he left, full of sadness and madness.  

But I stayed to look at the crowd,  
and saw something that should scare me.
