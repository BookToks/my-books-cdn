Inferno Dante Alighieri Dante Alighieri, or simply Dante (May 14/June 13, 1265 – September 13/14,1321),wasanItalianpoetfromFlorence. Hiscentralwork,theCommedia (Divine Comedy), is considered the greatest literary work composed in the Italian language and a masterpiece of world literature. In Italian he is known as “the Supreme Poet” (il Sommo Poeta). Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio are also known as “the three fountains” or “the three crowns”.
 
 Dante is also called “the Father of the Italian language”. The first biography written on him was by his contemporary Giovanni Villani (1276 – 1348).
 
 Life DanteAlighieriwasbornin1265,betweenMay14andJune13,underthe name“DuranteAlighieri.” His family was prominent in Florence, with loyalties to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the Papacy and which was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the Holy RomanEmperor.
 
 Dante pretended that his family descended from the ancient Romans (Inferno, XV, 76), but the earliest relative he can mention by name is Cacciaguida degli Elisei (Paradiso, XV, 135), of no earlier than about 1100.
 
 Dante’s father, Alighiero di Bellincione, was a White Guelph (see Politics section) who suffered no reprisals after the Ghibellines won the Battle of Montaperti in the mid 13th century. This suggests that Alighiero or his familyenjoyedsomeprotectiveprestigeandstatus.
 
 The poet’s mother was Bella degli Abati. She died when Dante was 7 years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, as widowers had social limitations in these matters. This woman definitely bore two children,Dante’sbrotherFrancescoandsisterTana(Gaetana).
