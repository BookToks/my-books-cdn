Dante Alighieri, or just Dante, was an Italian poet from Florence. He was born between May 14 and June 13, 1265, and died in September 1321. His most famous work, the Divine Comedy, is one of the best books ever written in Italian and is loved all over the world. In Italy, people call him "the Supreme Poet." Along with Petrarch and Boccaccio, Dante is part of a group known as "the three fountains" or "the three crowns."

Dante is also called "the Father of the Italian language." The first story about his life was written by his friend Giovanni Villani, who lived around the same time.

Dante was born in 1265 and his original name was Durante Alighieri. His family was important in Florence and supported the Guelphs, a political group that backed the Pope. They were often in conflict with the Ghibellines, who supported the Holy Roman Emperor.

Dante liked to say his family came from ancient Romans, but the earliest relative he could name lived around the year 1100.

Dante’s dad, Alighiero di Bellincione, was part of the White Guelphs. After the Ghibellines won a big battle, Alighiero and his family were not punished, which means they were respected and had some power.

Dante’s mom was Bella degli Abati. She died when Dante was only 7 years old. After that, his dad married again to a woman named Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. We’re not sure if they were officially married, because widowers had some social rules. Lapa had two kids with Dante’s dad, named Francesco and Tana (or Gaetana).
