In order to understand your punishments, imagine a bull that breaks free right after it’s been seriously hurt. It can’t walk properly and staggers around. The Minotaur looked like that, and he, being careful, shouted: “Run to the passage! While he’s angry, it’s best you go down.”

So we went down past a shower of stones that sometimes moved under my feet because of the strange weight I was carrying.

I thought deeply, and he said: “You’re probably thinking about this broken place, guarded by that angry beast I just controlled.

Now I’ll tell you that the last time I came down to the underworld, this cliff hadn’t fallen yet.

But if I’m right, just before the powerful one who defeated Dis came, the whole deep and ugly valley shook so much that I thought the whole universe was trembling with love. Some people believe the world was turning into chaos then.

At that moment, this ancient cliff shook and fell here and in other places.

Look down now, because the river of boiling blood is nearby, where anyone who hurts others with violence is punished.”

Blind greed and crazy anger push us forward in our short lives, and then drag us down badly in the afterlife!

I saw a bent moat shaped like a bow. Being evil or staying evil is like a Minotaur—an enemy to others and cut off from any good friends, just like that poor monster.
