Halfway through my life’s journey,  
I found myself lost in a dark forest,  
because I had lost the straight path.  

Oh no! It’s really hard to explain  
how scary, rough, and wild that forest was,  
and just thinking about it brings back fear.  

It was so bitter that death felt easier;  
but there were some good things there too,  
and I will talk about the other things I saw.  

I can’t clearly remember how I got there,  
because I was so sleepy  
at the moment I left the right way.  

But after I reached the bottom of a mountain,  
where the valley ended,  
which made my heart fill with fear,  
I looked up and saw its shoulders.
