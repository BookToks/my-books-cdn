Rejoice, Florence, because you are so great  
That you spread your wings over the sea and land,  
And even in Hell, your name is known everywhere!  

Among the thieves, I found five citizens from your city,  
And their shame makes me feel bad,  
Even though this doesn’t make us look any better.  

But if when morning comes our dreams come true,  
Soon you will feel what Prato, if no one else, wishes for you.  
And if it happened now, it wouldn’t be too soon;  
I hope it does, because it has to happen,  
And it will upset me more the longer I wait.  

We went on our way, and up the stairs  
That the boundary had made us go down before,  
My guide got back on and pulled me along.  

Following a lonely path  
Among rocks and cliffs,  
My feet moved, but my hands stayed still.  

I felt sad then, and I feel sad again  
When I think about what I saw,  
And I try to control my thoughts more than usual,  
So they don’t run wild unless guided by good sense.
