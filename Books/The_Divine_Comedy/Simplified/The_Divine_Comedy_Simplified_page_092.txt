paskvil.com/ Alexander and fierce Dionysius of Sicily caused many painful years.

That forehead with black hair is Azzolino; and the blond one is Obizzo of Esti, who was actually killed by his stepsons. Then I turned to the Poet, and he said, “He’s first to you, and second to me.” 

A little farther on, the Centaur stopped above some people who looked like they were coming out of a boiling river. 

He showed us a shadow on one side and said, “He split the heart that is still honored on the Thames.” Then the people lifted their heads and chests out of the river, and I recognized many of them. 

The blood got shallower and shallower, covering only their feet, and our path was across the moat. 

The Centaur said, “Even though you see the boiling stream here getting smaller, believe me, on the other side it gets even weaker until it joins again where tyranny makes people suffer.”

Alexander was from Thessaly, and Dionysius was from Syracuse.

Azzolino, also known as Ezzolino di Romano, was a cruel ruler of Padua, called the Son of the Devil. 

Ariosto described him as a fierce and inhuman lord. He was so cruel that a crusade was started against him. He died in prison in 1259, tearing off his bandages and fighting fiercely until the end. 

Obizzo of Esti was the Marquis of Ferrara. He was murdered by Azzo, who he thought was his son, but was not. Many people called themselves sons or stepsons.

Guido di Monforte killed Prince Henry of England “in God’s bosom,” meaning inside a church at Viterbo. 

Violence was common in Florence during Dante’s time.
