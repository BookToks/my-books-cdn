Inferno Canto 7

“Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!” Plutus shouted with his clucking voice.  

The wise guide who knew everything said to calm me down, “Don’t be scared. No power he has can stop you from going down this cliff.”  

Then he turned to the fat, angry monster and said, “Be quiet, you cursed wolf. Burn inside with your own anger.”  

This trip to the abyss isn’t without a reason. It’s what’s decided up above, where Michael punished proud sinners.  

Just like a ship’s mast breaks and falls when the wind is too strong, the cruel monster fell to the ground.  

So, we went down into the fourth pit, moving closer to a sad shore filled with all the pain of the world.  

Oh, God’s justice! Why do you pile up so many new troubles and sufferings, as I saw?  

And why do our sins destroy us so much?  

Just like the waves toss around Charybdis...
