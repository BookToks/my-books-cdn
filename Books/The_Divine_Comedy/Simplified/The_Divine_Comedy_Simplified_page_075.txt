From now on, we walk along a narrow path  
between the suffering and the city wall,  
my Master and I following behind him.  

“O mighty power, who guides me through these sinful circles,  
please speak to me and satisfy my curiosity.  
Can the people lying in these tombs be seen?  
They seem uncovered, and no one is watching them.”  

He answered me: “They will all be sealed up  
when they return from Jehoshaphat,  
bringing back the bodies they left above.  

Their cemetery is on this side,  
with Epicurus and all his followers,  
who believe the soul dies with the body.  
But about your question, I will soon satisfy you,  
and also keep silent about what you ask.”  

I said, “Good Leader, I keep my feelings hidden  
so I speak less,  
and now you have made me ready to listen.”  

He said, “O Tuscan, you who live through the city of fire,  
speak carefully and please stop here a moment.  

Your way of talking shows clearly  
you are from that noble homeland,  
which maybe I once troubled too much.”  

Suddenly, a sound came from nearby.
