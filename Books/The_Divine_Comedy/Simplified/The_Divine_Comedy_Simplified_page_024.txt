14 http://www.paskvil.com/ Figure5: The day was ending...

The sun was going down, and the sky was turning orange and pink. It felt like the day was slowly disappearing, making way for the night.

People were finishing up their activities and getting ready to relax or go home. Everything was quieting down as the evening started.

It was a calm moment, perfect for thinking or just enjoying the peacefulness before bedtime.
