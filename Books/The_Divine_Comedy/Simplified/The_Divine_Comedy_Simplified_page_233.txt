Because of his cruel thoughts, I trusted him and was trapped. Then, I was put to death—I don’t need to say more. But even if you haven’t heard this before, I will tell you how harsh my death was. You will learn if he truly wronged me.

I was locked up in a small prison called the Mew, named after famine. Others were kept there too. Through a small hole, I had seen many things for a long time, when I had a bad dream about the future that scared me.

In my dream, I saw a lord and master hunting wolves and their pups on a mountain between Pisa and Lucca. He sent his lean, eager hunting dogs ahead. These dogs were the Pisan mob, and the hunters were the noblemen.

The chase didn’t last long. I saw the father and sons getting worn out, and with sharp tusks, it looked like their sides were torn open.

Before dawn, I woke up. I heard my sons, who were with me, moaning in their sleep and asking for bread.

You are truly cruel if you don’t feel sad when you think about what my heart feared. If you don’t cry now, what will you ever cry for?

My sons woke up, and it was almost the time when our food was usually brought to us.
