We came to a big, fancy castle with tall walls all around it, seven times over. A small river flowed around it, and we walked over it like it was solid ground. I went through seven gates with my guides and entered a green meadow.

There were people there who looked serious and calm, with strong faces. They didnâ€™t talk much and spoke softly.

We moved to the side into a bright, open space where we could see all of them clearly.

Across the green field, I was shown some famous and powerful spirits, and seeing them made me feel proud.

I saw Electra with many friends, including Hector and Aeneas, Caesar with sharp eyes like a falcon, Camilla and Penthesilea. On the other side, I saw King Latinus with his daughter Lavinia. I also saw Brutus who chased out Tarquin, and Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia. Alone and apart, I saw Saladin.

When I looked up a bit, I saw the great teacher of all knowledge sitting with his group of wise people.

Everyone looked at him and respected him.

There I saw both Socrates and Plato.
