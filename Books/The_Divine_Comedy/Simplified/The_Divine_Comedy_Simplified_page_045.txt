These words were told to us by them.

As soon as I heard about their suffering souls, I bowed my head and kept it down until the Poet asked me, “What do you think?” When I answered, I began: “Oh no!

How many happy thoughts, how much desire, led them to this painful fate!” Then I turned to them and spoke, starting with: “Your pain, Francesca, makes me sad and want to cry.

But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs, how and in what way did Love allow you to know your uncertain desires?” And she said to me: “There is no greater sadness than remembering happy times when you are miserable, and your Teacher knows that well.

But if you want to understand the first cause of love in us, I will tell you, even if it makes me cry as I speak.

One day we were reading for our pleasure about Launcelot, and how Love had captured him.”
