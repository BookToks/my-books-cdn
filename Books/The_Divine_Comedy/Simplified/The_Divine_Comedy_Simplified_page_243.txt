Underneath each came out two huge wings,  
Like those of a giant bird; I had never seen sails so big on the sea.

They didn’t have feathers, but looked like a bat’s wings;  
He was waving them, and three winds blew out from them.

Because of this, the river Cocytus completely froze.

He was crying with six eyes, and tears and bloody spit dropped from three chins.

At every mouth, he was biting with his teeth like a brake,  
So he tormented all three of them this way.

For him, the biting didn’t matter compared to the clawing,  
Sometimes his spine was left completely bare without skin.

“The soul up there with the greatest pain,” the Master said,  
“Is Judas Iscariot; his head is inside, but his legs are outside.

Of the other two, whose heads hang down,  
The one hanging from the black mouth is Brutus;  
Look how he twists and doesn’t say a word.

The other one, who looks stiff, is Cassius.

But night is coming again, and it’s time  
For us to leave, since we have seen everything.”  
This seemed good to me, so I put my arm around him,  
And he took control of time and place,  
Hatred, and helplessness. Some say these stand for the three quarters of the known world: Europe, Asia, and Africa.
