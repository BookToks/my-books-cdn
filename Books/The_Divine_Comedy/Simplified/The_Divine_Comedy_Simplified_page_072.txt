As soon as I entered the fortress, I looked around and saw many plain tombs everywhere. They were full of sadness and terrible suffering.

Just like in Arles, where the Rhône river barely moves, and near Pola by the Quarnaro gulf that borders Italy, these tombs made the whole place uneven. The tombs there were even harsher because flames burned between them. These flames were so hot that no metal could handle the heat.

All the tomb coverings were lifted, and from the loud cries, you could really feel how miserable and tortured the people were inside.

I asked, “Master, who are all these people making those sad sounds inside the tombs?” He answered, “These are the leaders of heresies and their followers from all kinds of groups. The tombs hold many more people than you think.

The similar ones are buried together, and the monuments get hotter or cooler depending on their sins.” Then he turned right, and we walked between the suffering and tall walls.

At Arles, old stories say that the Peers of Charlemagne and their ten thousand armed men are buried there.

Pola is a city in Istria. Near Pola, there are about seven hundred tombs of different shapes. Quarnaro is a gulf at the northern end of the Adriatic Sea.
