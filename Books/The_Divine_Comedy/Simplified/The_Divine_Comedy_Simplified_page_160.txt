We walked quietly, all alone, one in front and the other behind, like the Minor Friars on their path. My thoughts went to Aesop’s fable because of the fight we were thinking about, where he talked about the frog and the mouse. The two words “mo” and “issa” mean “now,” just like these two are very similar if you look closely at how they connect.

And just like one idea comes from another, another idea was born from the first, which made me even more afraid.

I thought, “People will probably laugh at our story and make fun of us so much that it must really bother them.

If they get angry and mean, they’ll come after us even harder than a dog snapping at a bone.” I felt my hair stand up with fear and stepped back, paying close attention. Then I said, “Master, if you’re not hiding yourself and me right now, I’m really scared of the Malebranche. I know they are behind us; I can already feel them.” He said, “If I were made of glass, your image wouldn’t show on me faster than I can show what’s inside me.”
