I bowed my head toward him and said, “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?” Someone recognized me, grabbed my garment, and shouted, “What a surprise!”  

When he reached out his arm to me, I looked closely at his burnt face. His scorched look didn’t stop me from knowing who he was. I bowed my head to his and asked again, “Are you really here, Ser Brunetto?”  

He answered, “I hope it’s okay, my son, if I spend a little time with you before I continue on.”  

I said, “I really want that. And if you want me to sit with you, I will, if it’s okay, because I’m going with him.”  

Brunetto Latini was Dante’s friend and teacher.
