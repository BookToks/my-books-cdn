Doré worked with other British publishers and got paid for it. Later, he made pictures for famous books like Coleridge’s Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Milton’s Paradise Lost, Tennyson’s The Idylls of the King, The Works of Thomas Hood, and The Divine Comedy. You could also see his art in the Illustrated London News.

He kept making book illustrations until he died in Paris in 1883. He is buried in the city’s Père Lachaise Cemetery.

In the story “Pickman’s Model,” author H. P. Lovecraft says great things about Doré. He says, “There’s something those artists catch – more than just life – that they can make us feel for a moment. Doré had it. Sidney Sime had it too.”
