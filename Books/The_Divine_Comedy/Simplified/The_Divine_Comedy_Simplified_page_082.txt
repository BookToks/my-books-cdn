My son, look inside these rocks,” he began to say, “there are three small circles. They go from one level to the next, like the ones you are leaving. They are all full of angry spirits. But just seeing them should be enough for you. Listen to why and how they are trapped.

Every kind of evil that comes from hate in Heaven ends in harm; and all harm is caused either by force or by trickery.

But trickery is a special kind of human sin. It makes God more upset, so the worst kind of suffering happens to liars and cheats.

The first circle is for violent people. Since violence can be done to three kinds of people, this circle is divided into three parts.

We can use force against God, against ourselves, and against others. I will explain these clearly so you understand.

Violent death and painful wounds are done to others; also destruction, burning, and harmful taxes. That’s why murderers, attackers, and thieves suffer in the first part.

A person can also hurt themselves or their own stuff. So in the second part, those who kill themselves, waste their money, or make bad choices suffer without hope.

Violence can also be done to God, by denying Him inside and disrespecting nature and its gifts.

That’s why the smallest part of this circle is for those who disrespect God and speak against Him from their hearts.
