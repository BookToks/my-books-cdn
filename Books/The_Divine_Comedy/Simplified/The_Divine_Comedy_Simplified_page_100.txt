paskvil.com/ “Those legs of yours at the jousting, Toppo!” And then, maybe because he was running out of breath, he hid himself in a bush.

Behind him was a forest full of black female dogs, hungry and fast like greyhounds, breaking free from their chains. They bit into the man who was hiding, tearing him apart piece by piece. Then they carried away his broken body parts.

My guide took me by the hand and showed me the bush that was crying from its bloody wounds, but it was all useless.

“O Jacopo,” the bush said, “from Sant’Andrea, why did you need me to hide behind? What did I do to deserve your terrible life?”

When the Master stopped near, he asked, “Who are you, that speak so sadly while bleeding from so many wounds?” The bush answered, “I am the souls who came here to see the terrible massacre that tore the leaves away from me. I am from the city that changed its first protector from Mars to St. John the Baptist, and because of this, it will always be sad.

If it weren’t for some signs of him still left on the banks of the Arno River, the citizens who rebuilt the city later would never forget.”
