One of the sinners showed his back, but soon covered it up before it could get any lighter.

Near the edge of a ditch filled with water, the frogs stood with only their noses out, hiding their feet and bodies under the water.

The sinners stood all around the soup. But whenever Barbariccia came close, they quickly moved away from the boiling liquid.

I saw this and my heart still shakes. While waiting, one frog stayed still as another jumped down. Graffiacan, who many had faced, grabbed him by his pitch-covered hair and pulled him up, making him look like an otter.

I already knew all their names because I had noticed them when they were chosen, and listened when they called each other.

“Rubicante, make sure you put your claws on him so you can tear him apart,” all the cursed ones shouted together.

And I said, “My Master, try to catch him if you can, so you’ll know who the unlucky one is, and he will fall into his enemies’ hands.” My Leader moved close to him and asked where he was from. He answered, “I was born in the kingdom of Navarre. My mother made me a servant to a lord because she had me with a rough man who destroyed himself and everything he owned.

Then I served the good King Thibault; I’m here because I was caught practicing bribery, and now I pay for it in this heat.”
