My guide and I got into the boat.  

My Lord said, “This time, you won’t have more time than it takes to cross the swamp.”  

He had heard about a big trick that was played on him and got really angry. That’s how Phlegyas felt, full of rage.  

My guide got down into the boat first, then he helped me get in. The boat looked heavy once I stepped inside.  

As soon as we were both in the boat, it started moving, cutting through the water more than usual.  

While we were going through the dead swamp, someone covered in mud appeared in front of me.  

He was a warning to everyone and shouted loudly through the darkness, “Since you’ve been warned, learn to be good and don’t disrespect the gods.”  

The boat creaked under the weight and was leaking water from the lake.  

He asked, “Who are you, coming here at this time?”
