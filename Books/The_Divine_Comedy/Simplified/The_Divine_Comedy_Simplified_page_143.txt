After her dad died, and the city that worshipped Bacchus was taken over, she wandered around the world for a long time.

In beautiful Italy, there is a lake at the foot of the Alps that separates Germany from Tyrol, called Benaco.

It’s fed by thousands of springs, maybe even more, between Garda and Val Camonica, in the Pennine Alps. The water in this lake sometimes becomes still and doesn’t flow.

Halfway along the lake, there is a spot where the pastors from Trento, Brescia, and Verona could bless if they passed by.

There sits Peschiera, a strong and beautiful fortress, facing the people of Brescia and Bergamo, where the banks of the lake slope down to the water.

Because of the lake’s shape, anything that can’t stay in Benaco has to flow out, turning into a river that runs through green fields.

As soon as the water starts moving, it’s no longer called Benaco but the Mincio River, which flows until it joins the Po River at Governo.

Not far from there, the river spreads out into a plain, making the land marshy and often sickly in the summer.

Passing through that area, the cruel virgin (Manto) was seen in the middle of the marsh, with no people living there.

She escaped from all human contact, stayed there with her servants, practiced her arts, lived there, and eventually died, leaving her body behind.
