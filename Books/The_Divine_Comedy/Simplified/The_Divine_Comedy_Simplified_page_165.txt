There was a person lying crosswise and naked on the path, as you can see; and he had to feel whoever passed by, first by how heavy they were. He was punished in the same way as his father-in-law.

Inside this moat were him and the others of the council, who were a harmful group to the Jews. Then I saw Virgil amazed at the man who was stretched out on the cross, suffering in this terrible place forever.

Then Virgil spoke to the Friar: “Don’t be upset if I ask you to tell me if there is a slope on the right side where the two of us can get out of here, without forcing some of the dark angels to come and free us from this deep place.” 

The Friar answered: “There is a rock closer than you think, which moves out from the big circle and crosses all the cruel valleys. But this rock is broken and doesn’t connect all the way. You will be able to climb up the broken part that slopes sideways and rises at the bottom.” 

Virgil stood quietly for a moment with his head down, then said: “This is a bad situation for anyone who fights the sinners over there with their hooks.” The Friar replied: “I have heard many of the Devil’s tricks in Bologna, and among them, that he is a liar and the father of lies.” 

Then my Leader walked on quickly, looking a bit angry; and I followed behind, walking in the steps of his beloved feet.
