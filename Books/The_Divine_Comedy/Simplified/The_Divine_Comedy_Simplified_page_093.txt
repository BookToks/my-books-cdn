Divine justice is like a force pushing people to suffer for what they did. On this side, it drives Attila, who was a terrible enemy to the world, and also Pyrrhus and Sextus. They are always made to cry because of the pain they caused.

There are also Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo, who started many wars on the roads. After that, the story moves on and crosses the river again.

Attila was known as the Scourge of God. People aren’t sure exactly which Pyrrhus and Sextus are meant, but they think it’s Pyrrhus of Epirus and Sextus Pompey, a pirate in the Mediterranean.

Not much is known about the two Rinier men except that one caused trouble near the Roman coast, and the other came from a well-known family in Florence.
