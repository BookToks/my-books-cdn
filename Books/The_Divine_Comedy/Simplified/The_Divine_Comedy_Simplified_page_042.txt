When they reach the edge of the cliff, there are screams, cries, and sad sounds. There, they curse the power of the gods.

I understood that these sinful people were punished like this because they let their desires control them.

Just like flocks of starlings fly together in big groups during cold weather, the angry spirits are blown around by strong winds. The winds push them here and there, up and down.

They have no hope or comfort anymore, only pain, even if it’s less than before.

Like cranes flying in a long line while making sounds, I saw these spirits moving forward, carrying their sadness.

Then I asked, “Master, who are these people that the dark winds are punishing?”

“The first group, about whom you want to know,” my guide said, “was ruled by a queen who spoke many languages.

She was so lost in her desires that she made lustful acts seem okay to hide her shame.

She is Semiramis, who took over after Ninus and was his wife. She ruled the land that the Sultan rules now.

Next is a woman who killed herself for love and broke promises with the ashes of Sichcaeus; then Cleopatra, known for her wild love life.”

I also saw Helen, for whom many cruel wars happened; and the great Achilles, who fought at the last moment for love.

I saw Paris, Tristan, and over a thousand others.
