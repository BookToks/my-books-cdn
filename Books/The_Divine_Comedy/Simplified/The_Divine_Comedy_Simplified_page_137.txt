Under my head, the others are dragged down,  
Those who came before me in lying,  
Flattened along the crack in the rock.  

Below there, I shall also fall,  
Whenever the one I thought you were arrives,  
At the sudden question I asked.  

But my feet are already burning,  
And I have been like this, upside down, for a long time.  

Then he will stand with red feet;  
Because after him will come worse deeds,  
From the west, a lawless leader,  
Someone who fits to cover both him and me.  

He will be a new Jason, the one we read about  
In Maccabees; and as his king was easy to control,  
So the ruler of France will be like this one.  
I don’t know if I am too bold here,  
But to him I answered only in this rhythm:  

“I pray you tell me now, how great a treasure  
Did our Lord first ask Saint Peter for,  
Before he gave him the keys?”  

His name, 'the Accomplished,' meant he had all the talents  
Of the best clerks in the world, but he was also a man  
Of perfect morals, huge ambition, and great skill.  
He died in 1280.  

The French Pope Clement V was chosen in 1305,  
Because of the power of Philip the Fair of France,  
With many humiliating rules.  
He moved the Pope’s seat from Rome to Avignon,  
Where it stayed for 71 years,  
In what Italian writers call the "Babylonian captivity."  
He died in 1314 on his way to Bordeaux.  

He had barely crossed the Rhone river  
When he got very sick at Roquemaure.  
His treasure was taken by his followers, especially his nephew;  
His body was treated so badly that the torches caught fire  
Under the platform where he lay, and he was not honored.  
Covered only by a single sheet,  
Half burned before anyone noticed.  
His ashes were taken back to Carpentras and buried properly.  

Jason was given permission by Antiochus Epiphanes  
To set up a place for sports and training youth  
In the ways of the heathen.  

Philip the Fair of France was said to be one of the most handsome men in the world,  
Tall, well-built, and wise for a layman.
