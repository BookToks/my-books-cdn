Inferno Canto 34

My master said, “Look ahead carefully and see if you can spot him.” 

It was like when a thick fog blows in, or when the night sky gets really dark. Far away, I thought I saw a big building. Because the wind was strong, I stepped behind my guide since there was nowhere else to hide.

I was there, feeling scared, where the shadows were all covered up and shining faintly like stained glass.

Some people were lying down, others standing up. Some had their heads down, others their feet. One was bent like a bow, with their face turned to their feet.

After we had walked a long way, my master wanted to show me the creature who once looked beautiful. He moved in front of me and told me to stop, saying, “Look at Dis, and see the place where you must prepare yourself with courage.”

I was so frozen and powerless that I can’t even explain it. Don’t ask me to, because no words could ever describe how I felt.
