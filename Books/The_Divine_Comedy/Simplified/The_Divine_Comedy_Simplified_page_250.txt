 When Dante was 12, in 1277, he was promised in marriage to Gemma diManettoDonati,daughterofMesserManettoDonati.

 Education and Poetry Not much is known about Dante’s education, and it is presumed he studiedathome. ItisknownthathestudiedTuscanpoetry,atatimewhenthe Sicilian School (Scuola poetica siciliana), a cultural group from Sicily, was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover the Occitan poetry of the troubadours and the Latin poetry of classical antiquity(withaparticulardevotiontoVirgil).
 
 During the “Secoli Bui” (Dark Ages), Italy had become a mosaic of small states, Sicily being the largest one, at the time under the Angevine dominations, and as far (culturally and politically) from Tuscany as Occitania was: the regions did not share a language, culture, or easy communications. Nevertheless, we can assume that Dante was a keen up-to-date intellectualwithinternationalinterests.
 
 At 18, Dante met Guido Cavalcanti, Lapo Gianni, Cino da Pistoia, and soon after Brunetto Latini; together they became the leaders of Dolce Stil Novo (“The Sweet New Style”). Brunetto later received a special mention in the Divine Comedy (Inferno, XV, 28), for what he had taught Dante. “Nor speakinglessonthataccount,IgoWithSerBrunetto,andIaskwhoareHismost known and most eminent companions”. Some fifty poetical components by DanteAlighieri-DivineComedy,Inferno 241 Dante are known (the so-called Rime, rhymes), others being included in the later Vita Nuova and Convivio.
