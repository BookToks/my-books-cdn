The Emperor of the sad kingdom came out of the ice from his chest up. He was huge, even bigger than giants, if you look at his arms. Think about how big he must be if just a part of him is that huge.

He used to be handsome, but now he looks ugly and angry at his Creator. No wonder all trouble comes from him.

It was amazing to me when I saw that he had three faces on his head! The front face was bright red, and the other two were joined above each shoulder. The right face looked a mix of white and yellow, and the left face looked like people from where the Nile River begins.
