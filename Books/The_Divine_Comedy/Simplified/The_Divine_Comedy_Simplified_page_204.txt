There was a terrible smell coming from the place, like rotten dead bodies usually give off.

We had climbed down to the farthest bank from the tall cliff on the left side. From there, I could see even better down to the bottom, where the powerful lady Justice punishes people who lie or cheat, and she keeps records of it.

I don't think there was anything worse to see in all of Aegina when everyone was sick. The air was full of disease, and even the animals and tiny worms died. Later, as the poets say, the people came back to life from the seeds of ants.

It was awful to look into that dark valley and see all the spirits lying in piles, suffering.

Some were lying on their stomachs, some on their backs, and others were crawling, moving slowly along the sad road.

We walked step by step without saying anything, looking at and listening to the sick people who didnâ€™t have the strength to lift themselves up.

I saw two people sitting, leaning against each other like hot pans leaning together, covered from head to toe with scabs.

I had never seen anyone being combed with a rough brush like a stable boy brushes a horse, or anyone who was kept awake against their will, like these people were biting their own skin quickly because of an unbearable itch that no one could help with.

They dragged the scabs off with their nails, like someone scraping the scales off a big fish with a knife.
