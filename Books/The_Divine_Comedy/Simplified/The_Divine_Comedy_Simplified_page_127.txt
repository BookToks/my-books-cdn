At the bottom were the sinners, all naked. In the middle, they faced us, and beyond that, with us but moving faster. Just like the Romans, for their huge army, during the Year of Jubilee on the bridge, they chose a way to pass by the people.

Everyone on one side faced the Castle and looked toward St. Peter’s. On the other side, they went toward the Mountain.

On this side and that, along the cold stone, I saw horned demons with big whips, cruelly beating the sinners from behind.

Oh no! How they made them lift their legs with the first hits! And no one waited for the second or the third blow.

As I kept going, my eyes met one of them, and I said right away, “I’m not afraid after seeing this one.” So I stopped to look at him carefully. With my kind Guide, I came to a stop and took a step back. The one being whipped tried to hide his face, but it didn’t help much.

I said, “You’re looking down, but if your face isn’t lying, you must be Venedico Caccianimico. But why are you stuck in such a bad place?”
