I saw two people sitting and leaning against each other.

My guide spoke to one of them, “Hey, you who keep hurting yourself with your fingers and turning them into pincers sometimes, tell me if any Latins are here with you. Maybe your nails will last forever doing this.”

“We are Latins, the ones you see suffering here,” one of them said, crying. “But who are you, asking about us?”

The guide answered, “I am the one who leads this living man down from cliff to cliff, and I plan to show him Hell.”

Then they stopped leaning on each other, and both of them, shaking, turned to me and to others who had heard the guide’s words.
