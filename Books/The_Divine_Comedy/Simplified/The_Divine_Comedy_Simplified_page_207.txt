But you should know who is helping you against the people of Siena. Look closely at me, and you will see that I am the ghost of Capocchio, who made fake metals using alchemy. You must remember how clever I was at copying nature.

There was a club in Siena, whose wild actions were written about by Benvenuto da Imola. This club had twelve very rich young men who wanted to do crazy things that would surprise the whole world. 

Each of them gave eighteen thousand golden florins, adding up to two hundred and sixteen thousand florins. They built a palace where each member had a fancy room. They threw big dinners and parties, sometimes ending by throwing all the gold and silver dishes and knives out the window.

Benvenuto said this silly club only lasted ten months because they ran out of money. After that, the poor members became a joke for everyone. To honor this club, a smart poet named Folgore da San Geminiano wrote twelve fun poems, one for each month of the year, with a dedication and a conclusion.

Capocchio, as the Ottimo says, was a very clever alchemist. He was burned for practicing alchemy in Siena, so he hated the Sienese people and showed this in the story. The author clearly knew him.
