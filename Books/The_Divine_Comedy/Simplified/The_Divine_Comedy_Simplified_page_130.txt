We were already where the narrow path crosses the second ditch and makes part of a support for another arch.

From there, we heard people moaning in the next pit, snorting like animals, and hitting their chests with their hands. The edges were covered with mold from the bad air below, and their eyes and noses were fighting the smell.

The pit was so deep that we couldn’t see the bottom unless we climbed up the arch’s back, where most of the rock hung over.

We went there and looked down into the pit. I saw people stuck in a disgusting mess that looked like it came from the worst toilets. While I looked carefully, I saw one person with his head covered in filth. I couldn’t tell if he was a priest or a normal guy.

He shouted to me, “Why are you so eager to look at me more than the other dirty ones?” I answered, “Because I think I’ve seen you before when your hair was dry. You’re Alessio Interminei from Lucca. So I watch you more than the others.” Then he hit his head hard and said, “Flatterers like me get sunk down here, but I never got enough of using my tongue.”

Then he told my guide, “Make sure you stick your face out a little more so you can clearly see the ugly, dirty woman who scratches herself with dirty nails and keeps changing between sitting and standing.”
