This happened when Juno was really angry because of Semele and the Theban family. Arthamas lost his mind after seeing his wife pregnant with twins.  

He shouted, “Set the traps so I can catch the lioness and her babies on the path!” Then he grabbed the first child, named Learchus, spun him around, and smashed him against a rock. His wife, carrying the other baby, drowned herself.  

Later, when the proud Trojans were defeated and their king was crushed along with his kingdom, Hecuba was sad and captive.  

She saw Polyxena lifeless and Polydorus lying on the ocean shore. She was so upset that she started barking like a dog because her pain was so strong.  

But unlike the Theban furies or the Trojans, who were like wild animals, I saw two pale, naked shadows...
