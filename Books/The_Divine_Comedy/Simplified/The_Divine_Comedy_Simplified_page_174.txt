At the end of his speech, the thief raised his hands high, making a rude gesture with both hands, and shouted, “Take that, God, because I’m aiming at you.” From that moment, snakes became his friends.

One snake wrapped around his neck as if saying, “I won’t let you speak anymore.” Another snake coiled tightly around his arms and held them so firmly in front of him that he couldn’t move.

Pistoia, oh Pistoia! Why don’t you decide to burn yourself to ashes and die, since you’re so good at doing bad things?

Through all the dark circles of Hell, I didn’t see anyone as proud against God as this thief, not even the one who fell down from the walls of Thebes!

He ran away and didn’t say another word.

I saw a Centaur full of anger shouting: “Where is the scoffer?”
