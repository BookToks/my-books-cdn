What used to make me happy now makes me sad. Feeling sorry and confessing, I gave up. Oh, how unlucky I am! It would have been better if I hadn’t.

The leader of the modern Pharisees had a war near the Lateran. This war was fought against Christians, not against the pagan Saracens, unbelieving Jews, or traitors who helped during the siege of Acre or traded with the enemy.  

Mr. Norton, who studied and traveled in Italy, explains it like this: The war near the Lateran was actually a fight with the powerful Colonna family. Two family members were cardinals. They felt cheated in the election and rebelled against Pope Boniface. The Colonnas didn’t hide their dislike for the Pope. Boniface even said they were working with his enemies to overthrow him.

The Colonnas left Rome because it was unsafe and went to their strong town of Palestrina. From there, they planned raids and gave shelter to people who hated the Pope. Meanwhile, Boniface didn’t trust Rome either and went to a safer place called Orvieto. On December 14, 1297, he called for a crusade against the Colonnas, offering full forgiveness to anyone who fought against these rebels and attacked Palestrina.

The Colonnas and their followers had already been kicked out of the Church and lost all their titles and property. Now, by the Pope’s order, they were enemies of the whole Church. Soldiers came from all over Papal Italy to fight them. Their lands were destroyed, and they were trapped inside their mountain town for a long time.

The war near the Lateran was all about taking Palestrina. The Lateran church and palace stood on a hill near Rome’s walls, looking out over the fields and mountains. About twenty miles away, on one of the Sabine mountains, was Palestrina. Back then, it was more famous than now because big columns from the old temple of Fortune still stood, and the old fort watched over the town.

Finally, in September 1298, the Colonnas, pushed to the edge, wanted peace. Boniface promised a lot. The two cardinals showed up in rough brown clothes and ropes around their necks to show they were sorry and obeying. The Pope not only forgave them but also promised to give back their titles and lands.

This promise was fake. While the Colonnas stayed close to him, hoping for the best, Boniface sent the Bishop of Orvieto to take over Palestrina and destroy it completely. Only the church was left standing as a reminder. They plowed the town’s site and scattered salt on the ground to make sure nothing would grow there again. The people were moved from the mountain to the plain and forced to build new homes.
