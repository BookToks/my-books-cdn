 409Count Ugolino della Ghererardesca was Podesta` of Pisa. “Raised to the highest officesoftherepublicfortenyears,”saysNapier,FlorentineHistory,I.318,“hewouldsoon have become absolute, had not his own nephew, Nino Visconte, Judge of Gallura, contested this supremacy and forced himself into conjoint and equal authority; this could notcontinue,andasortofcompromisewasforthemomenteffected,bywhichVisconte retired to the absolute government of Sardinia. But Ugolino, still dissatisfied, sent his son to disturb the island; a deadly feud was the consequence, Guelph against Guelph, while the latent spirit of Ghibellinism, which filled the breasts of the citizens and was encouraged by priest and friar, felt its advantage; the Archbishop Ruggiero Rubaldino was its real head, but he worked with hidden caution as the apparent friend of either chieftain. In 1287, after some sharp contests, both of them abdicated, for the sake, as it was alleged, of public tranquillity; but, soon perceiving their error, again united, and, scouringthestreetswithalltheirfollowers,forciblyre-establishedtheirauthority.
