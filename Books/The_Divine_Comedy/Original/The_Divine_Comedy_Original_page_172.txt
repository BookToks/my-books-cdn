 290VanniFucci, whocallshimselfamule, wasabastardsonofFucciode’Lazzari. All the commentators paint him in the darkest colors. Dante had known him as “a man of blood and wrath,” and seems to wonder he is here, and not in the circle of the Violent, oroftheIrascible. Buthisgreatcrimewastherobberyofasacristy. BenvenutodaImola relates the story in detail. He speaks of him as a man of depraved life, many of whose misdeedswentunpunished,becausehewasofnoblefamily.BeingbanishedfromPistoia for his crimes, he returned to the city one night of the Carnival, and was in company witheighteenotherrevellers, amongwhomwasVannidellaNona, anotary; when, not contentwiththeirinsipiddiversions,hestoleawaywithtwocompanionstothechurchof SanGiacomo,and,findingitscustodiansabsent,orasleepwithfeastinganddrinking,he enteredthesacristyandrobbeditofallitspreciousjewels.Thesehesecretedinthehouse ofthenotary,whichwascloseathand,thinkingthatonaccountofhishonestreputeno suspicionwouldfalluponhim. AcertainRampinowasarrestedforthetheft,andputto the torture; when Vanni Fucci, having escaped to Monte Carelli, beyond the Florentine jurisdiction, sent a messenger to Rampino’s father, confessing all the circumstances of the crime. Hereupon the notary was seized “on the first Monday in Lent, as he was going to a sermon in the church of the Minorite Friars,” and was hanged for the theft, and Rampino set at liberty. No one has a good word to say for Vanni Fucci, except the DanteAlighieri-DivineComedy,Inferno 163 Beast,andPistoiawasmyworthyden.
