The bitter hardships you have faced are not just random problems or one-time troubles. They are a normal part of what every slave has to go through. These hardships are built into the system itself, not just accidents that happen sometimes.

I will read your book carefully and worry about what it means for you.

A few years ago, when you started to tell me your real name and where you were born, I stopped you because I wanted to stay unaware of those things. I kept it vague until recently, when you read me your life story. At that moment, I wasn’t sure if I should thank you or not because it’s still dangerous in Massachusetts for honest people to say who they really are! They say the people who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 did it while risking their lives.

You are also sharing your story about freedom while being surrounded by danger. In the whole country covered by the U.S. Constitution, there is no place where a runaway slave can say, “I am safe.” Even Northern laws don’t protect you. Honestly, if I were you, I might have just burned the manuscript.

Maybe you can tell your story safely because so many people care about you and admire your talents and your dedication to helping others. But that safety comes only because of your hard work and the brave efforts of people who ignore the laws and Constitution to protect runaway slaves. They are determined to “hide the outcast” and make their homes places where the oppressed can find shelter. Someday, even the humblest person will be able to walk our streets and safely speak out about the cruelty they have suffered.
