Mr. Covey gave us enough food, but hardly any time to eat it. We often had less than five minutes to finish our meals. We worked outside from the moment the sun came up until it went down. Sometimes, when we were gathering food late at night, we stayed in the fields until midnight, tying up the plants.

Covey was usually with us. Here’s how he worked: he spent most of his afternoons in bed. Then, in the evening, he came out fresh and ready to push us harder with his words, his example, and often with his whip.

Mr. Covey was one of the few slave owners who worked with his own hands. He was very hardworking. He knew exactly what a man or a boy could do. He couldn’t be tricked. His work went well even when he wasn’t there, and he made us feel like he was always watching us.

He was very sneaky. He rarely came to where we worked openly; he tried to surprise us instead. He was so clever that we called him “the snake.” When we worked in the cornfield, he sometimes crawled on his hands and knees to sneak up on us. Then suddenly, he would jump up near us and shout, “Ha, ha! Come on, come on! Keep working!” Because of this, it was never safe to stop working for even a minute.

He showed up like a thief in the night. It felt like he was everywhere—under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window on the plantation. Sometimes, he would ride his horse like he was going seven miles to St. Michael’s, but half an hour later, you’d find him hiding in a corner of the wooden fence, watching us closely. He would leave his horse tied up in the woods and watch us from there.

Other times, he would walk up to us, give orders like he was about to leave on a long trip, then turn around as if going to the house to get ready. But before he got halfway there, he’d suddenly stop, crawl into a corner of the fence or hide behind a tree, and keep watching us until the sun went down.
