After buying her, he hired a married man named Mr. Samuel Harrison to live with him for one year. Every night, he made that man sleep tied up with her! Because of this, at the end of the year, the poor woman gave birth to twins. Mr. Covey was very happy about this, both with the man and the woman. He and his wife were so glad that they did everything they could to take care of Caroline while she was having the babies. The children were seen as more money and value for Mr. Covey.

If there was ever a time in my life when slavery felt the worst, it was during the first six months with Mr. Covey. We had to work no matter the weather. It didn’t matter if it was too hot, too cold, raining, windy, hailing, or snowing—we still had to work outside.

Work was all we did, almost every hour of the day and night. Even the longest days felt too short for him, and the shortest nights felt too long. When I first got there, I was hard to control, but after a few months of this strict treatment, I was broken. Mr. Covey broke me in my body, soul, and spirit. My natural energy was gone, my mind felt tired, I lost the desire to read, the happy light in my eyes disappeared, and the dark sadness of slavery took over me. I became like a cruel animal.

Sunday was the only day I had to rest. I spent it in a kind of tired daze, half asleep under a big tree. Sometimes, a quick feeling of freedom would flash inside me, with a little hope shining for a moment before it disappeared. I would fall back down, feeling sorry for myself. Sometimes I thought about ending my life and Covey’s, but hope and fear stopped me.
