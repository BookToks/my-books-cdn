LETTER FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.

BOSTON, April 22, 1845.

My Dear Friend: You know the old story about “The Man and the Lion,” where the lion complained that history was unfair because it was written by men, not lions. I’m happy that now the “lions” get to tell their side of the story.

For a long time, we had to learn about slavery only from the slave owners. You could guess how bad slavery was just from that, without needing more proof. 

Some people focus only on small things, like how little food slaves got or how many lashes they received, and those people usually don’t become fighters for change or abolition.

Back in 1838, many people were waiting to see what happened after the West Indies ended slavery before they joined our cause. Those results came a long time ago, but sadly, few of those people changed their minds and joined us. 

To really fight against slavery, a person must judge freedom by more than just how much sugar is made and hate slavery for more reasons than just because it starves and hurts people. Only then can someone truly begin the fight against slavery.
