I have said that this way of treating slaves is part of the whole system of lying and cruelty in slavery. It is true. The method used here to make the slave hate freedom, by only showing him the bad side of it, is used in other ways too.

For example, a slave loves molasses and steals some. Many times, his master goes to town and buys a lot. Then he comes back, takes his whip, and forces the slave to eat so much molasses that the slave gets sick just hearing about it. 

The same trick is used to stop slaves from asking for more food than they are allowed. If a slave eats all his food and asks for more, his master gets angry. But instead of sending him away hungry, he gives him too much food and forces him to eat it quickly. If the slave says he can’t eat it all, the master says he’s never happy and beats him for being difficult! I have many stories like this from what I have seen, but these examples are enough. This kind of treatment is very common.

On January 1, 1834, I left Mr. Covey and went to live with Mr. William Freeland, who lived about three miles from St. Michael’s. I soon saw that Mr. Freeland was very different from Mr. Covey. Even though he wasn’t rich, he was what people would call an educated southern gentleman. Mr. Covey, as I said, was trained to break slaves and make them obey. 

Mr. Freeland, though a slaveholder, seemed to care about honor, justice, and humanity. Mr. Covey did not care about any of these things. Mr. Freeland had many faults common to slaveholders, like being quick to anger and complaining a lot; but I must say he didn’t have the terrible bad habits that Mr. Covey had.
