Early on Monday morning, before Master Hugh could find a job for me, I went out and got a job with Mr. Butler at his shipyard near the drawbridge, on the City Block. This meant he didn’t have to look for work for me. At the end of the week, I gave him between eight and nine dollars. He seemed really happy and asked why I didn’t do that the week before. He had no idea what I was planning.

I worked hard to make him think I was happy and not planning to run away. I did a great job at this. He probably thought I was the happiest I had ever been, even though I was actually planning my escape. The second week went by, and I gave him all my wages again. He was so pleased he gave me twenty-five cents, which was a big deal for a slave owner to give a slave, and told me to use it well. I said I would.

Things were going okay on the outside, but inside I was struggling. It’s hard to explain how I felt as the day to run away got closer. I had a lot of good friends in Baltimore—friends I loved almost as much as my own life—and the thought of never seeing them again was so painful. I think many people stay in slavery just because they don’t want to leave their friends. Leaving them was the hardest part for me.

Loving my friends made me doubt my decision more than anything else. Besides the pain of leaving, I was scared I might fail. I was more worried than the first time I tried to escape. The terrible failure I had before haunted me. I was sure that if I failed this time, I would be stuck as a slave forever.
