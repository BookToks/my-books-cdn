We knew that if we were sold, we would probably be separated. Since he was already with them, he decided to go quietly back home.

I was left alone, stuck inside a stone prison. Just a few days before, I felt hopeful. I thought I would be safe in a free land. But now, I felt very sad and hopeless. I thought I would never be free. I stayed like this for about a week. Then, to my surprise, Captain Auld, my owner, came and took me out. He planned to send me to Alabama with a man he knew. But for some reason, he didn’t send me to Alabama. Instead, he sent me back to Baltimore to live with his brother Hugh and learn a trade.

After being gone for three years and one month, I was finally allowed to return to my old home in Baltimore. My owner sent me away because many people there didn’t like me, and he was afraid I might be hurt.

A few weeks after I got to Baltimore, Master Hugh hired me out to Mr. William Gardner, a big ship-builder on Fell’s Point. I was sent there to learn how to calk ships. But it wasn’t a good place to learn. Mr. Gardner was busy building two large warships that spring. They were supposed to be finished by July, or Mr. Gardner would lose a lot of money. So, when I arrived, everything was rushed. There was no time to learn. Everyone had to do what they already knew how to do. When I got to the shipyard, Mr. Gardner told me to do whatever the carpenters told me to do.
