His statements can be easily proven wrong if they are not true.

In his story, he talks about two cases of terrible violence. In one, a plantation owner shot a slave from a nearby farm because the slave accidentally came onto his land to fish. In the other, a manager killed a slave who ran to a stream to escape a violent beating.

Mr. Douglass says that in both cases, no one was arrested or investigated by the law. The Baltimore American newspaper, on March 17, 1845, shared a similar story: A young man named Matthews, whose family was well-connected, shot a slave on his father’s farm after the slave didn’t follow his orders. Matthews then ran to his father’s house and was not punished.

It’s important to remember that no slave owner or manager could be found guilty of hurting a slave, no matter how horrible it was, if the only witnesses were Black people, whether they were slaves or free.

According to the slave laws, Black people were not allowed to testify against white people in court, as if they weren’t even human. This means slaves had no real legal protection, and they could be treated cruelly without anyone being punished.
