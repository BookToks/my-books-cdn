I have felt it was my duty to speak out against the religion shown by these groups.

I end by sharing a description of the religion in the South (which is also the religion in the North by connection and fellowship). I honestly believe this description is very accurate, without any exaggeration. It was written years before the anti-slavery movement started by a Northern Methodist preacher. He lived in the South and saw how slave owners acted, their habits, and their religious beliefs with his own eyes. The Lord says, "Should I not punish these things? Shouldn't I take revenge on a nation like this?"

Here is a parody:

“Come, good and bad people, listen to me.  
How holy priests beat Jack and Nell,  
And women buy and sell children,  
While preaching that all sinners will go to hell,  
And singing about heavenly unity.

“They act like goats making noise,  
Eat up black sheep, and focus on tiny things,  
Wear fine black coats,  
Then grab their slaves by the necks,  
And choke them, all for heavenly unity.

“They will judge you if you drink a little,  
And send you to hell if you steal a lamb;  
But they steal from Tony, Doll, and Sam,  
Taking their rights and food,  
That’s the kidnapper’s version of heavenly unity.”
