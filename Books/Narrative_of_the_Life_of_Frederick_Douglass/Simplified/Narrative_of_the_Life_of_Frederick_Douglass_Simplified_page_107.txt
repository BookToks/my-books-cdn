About two months later, I asked Master Hugh if I could hire out my time. He didn’t know that I had already asked Master Thomas and was turned down.

At first, Master Hugh also seemed like he would say no. But after thinking about it, he said yes and gave me these rules: I could keep all my time, make deals with the people I worked for, and find my own jobs. But I had to pay him three dollars every week, buy my own calking tools, and pay for my food and clothes. My food cost two and a half dollars a week. With clothes and tools, I had to spend about six dollars each week.

I had to make that money every week, no matter what. If I didn’t pay him, I would lose the chance to hire my time. This deal was really good for my master. He didn’t have to watch me or worry about anything, and he still got money. He got all the good parts of owning a slave without the problems. But I had to deal with all the problems of being a slave and the stress of acting like a free person.

It was a tough deal, but I thought it was better than how things were before. It was a step toward freedom because I was allowed to take responsibility like a free man, and I was determined to keep it. I worked hard to make money. I worked day and night and, by not giving up, I made enough to cover my costs and even save a little every week.

I kept this up from May until August. But then Master Hugh said I couldn’t hire my time anymore. He said it was because one Saturday night I didn’t pay him for that week. I missed the payment because I went to a camp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore. During the week, I had made plans with some friends to leave Baltimore early Saturday evening for the camp, but my employer kept me late, so I couldn’t get to Master Hugh’s on time and had to let my friends down.
