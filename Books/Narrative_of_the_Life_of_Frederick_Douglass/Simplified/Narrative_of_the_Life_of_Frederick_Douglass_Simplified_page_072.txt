Mr. Covey was really good at tricking people. His whole life was about planning and carrying out big lies. Everything he knew about learning or religion, he used to help him lie better. He even acted like he could trick God. He would say a short prayer in the morning and a long one at night. Surprisingly, sometimes he looked like he was really religious.

When his family prayed together, they always started by singing. Since he was a terrible singer, I usually had to start the hymn. He would read the hymn and nod at me to begin. Sometimes I would start singing, and other times I wouldn’t.

When I didn’t start singing, things got messy. To prove he didn’t need me, he would try to sing the hymn himself, but he did it very badly. When he was in this mood, he prayed with extra energy. Poor guy! Because he was so good at lying, I truly think he sometimes fooled himself into believing he was a true worshipper of God. And this was even while he was forcing his woman slave to commit a terrible sin.

Here’s what happened: Mr. Covey was poor and just starting out in life. He could only afford to buy one slave. Shockingly, he said he bought her to have children. Her name was Caroline. Mr. Covey bought her from a man named Thomas Lowe, about six miles from St. Michael’s. She was a strong woman, about twenty years old. She already had one child, which showed she was exactly what he wanted.
