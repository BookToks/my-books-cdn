Many people don’t really understand what slavery is like. They find it hard to believe when they hear about the horrible things slaves go through every day. They know slaves are treated like property, but that doesn’t make them see it as unfair or cruel.

If you tell them about slaves being whipped, hurt, or branded, or about the bad conditions they live in with no education or freedom, they act like these stories are huge exaggerations. They get angry and say it’s not true, and that the slave owners in the South aren’t as bad as people say.

But all these terrible things happen because of slavery. It’s worse to treat a person like an object than to punish them. Whips, chains, and guards are all used to control slaves and protect the slave owners. When slaves can’t marry or have rights, bad things like cheating and abuse happen. When someone has total power over another person’s life, they will often use it in terrible ways.

There are many people who don’t believe these stories. Sometimes it’s because they haven’t thought about it much, but mostly it’s because they don’t want to face the truth. They want to protect slavery and look down on Black people, whether they are free or enslaved. These people try to say the stories about cruelty aren’t true, but they won’t succeed.

Mr. Douglass openly shares where he was born, the names of the people who owned him, and the names of those who did the bad things he describes in this honest story.
