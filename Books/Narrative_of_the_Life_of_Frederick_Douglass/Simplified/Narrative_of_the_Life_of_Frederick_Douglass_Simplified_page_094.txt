“Well,” he said, “I just had a thought.” We didn’t say anything more. I was more sure of something than ever before.

The horn blew like usual, and we went from the field to the house for breakfast. I went inside mostly because I wanted to sit down, not really because I was hungry. When I got to the house, I looked out the lane gate and saw four white men on horses and two Black men walking behind them like they were tied up. I watched them until they got to our gate. They stopped and tied the two Black men to the gate post. I still wasn’t sure what was going on.

Soon after, Mr. Hamilton rode up really fast, looking very worried. He asked if Master William was inside. Someone told him William was at the barn. Without getting off his horse, Mr. Hamilton rode quickly to the barn. After a short time, he and Mr. Freeland came back to the house. By then, three constables had arrived, quickly got off their horses, tied them up, and met William and Mr. Hamilton coming back from the barn. After talking for a bit, they all walked to the kitchen door.

Only John and I were in the kitchen; Henry and Sandy were at the barn. Mr. Freeland stuck his head in and called me by name, saying some gentlemen wanted to see me. I went to the door and asked what they wanted. Suddenly, they grabbed me and tied my hands tightly without explaining anything. I kept asking what was happening. Finally, they said they heard I was in some kind of trouble and that I had to be questioned by my master. They promised that if the story wasn’t true, I wouldn’t be hurt.
