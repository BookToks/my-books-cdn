Every sound from those songs was a way of showing how much slaves hated slavery and asking God to free them from their chains. Hearing those loud, sad notes always made me feel down and deeply sad. I have often found myself crying while listening to them. Even now, thinking about those songs makes me feel upset, and as I write this, a tear has already fallen from my eye.

Those songs helped me first understand how cruel slavery really is. I will never forget that feeling. Those songs still stay with me, making me hate slavery even more and feel more sorry for my brothers and sisters who are slaves.

If someone wants to understand how badly slavery hurts the soul, they should go to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation on payday, stand quietly in the deep pine woods, and listen carefully to the sounds around them. If they don’t feel moved, it’s only because their heart is hard and unfeeling.

After I moved north, I was surprised to hear some people say that slaves sang because they were happy and content. That’s a big mistake. Slaves actually sing the most when they are the most unhappy. Their songs show their sadness, and singing helps ease their pain, just like crying helps ease a hurting heart.

That was my experience. I often sang to forget my sadness, but rarely to show happiness. Crying and singing for joy were rare for me while I was trapped in slavery. The singing of a man stranded alone on a lonely island is just as much a sign of sadness as the singing of a slave; both come from the same feelings.
