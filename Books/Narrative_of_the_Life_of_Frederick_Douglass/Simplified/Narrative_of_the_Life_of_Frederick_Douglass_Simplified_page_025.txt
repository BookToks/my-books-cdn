My master’s family had two sons, Andrew and Richard, one daughter named Lucretia, and her husband, Captain Thomas Auld. They all lived together in one house on Colonel Edward Lloyd’s main plantation. My master worked as Colonel Lloyd’s clerk and was in charge of the other overseers. He was like the boss of the overseers.

I spent two years of my childhood on this plantation with my old master’s family. It was here that I saw the violent event I talked about in the first chapter. Since I first learned about slavery on this plantation, I want to describe what it was like there.

The plantation was about twelve miles north of Easton, in Talbot County, near the Miles River. They mainly grew tobacco, corn, and wheat. They grew so much that they always had work for a big boat to take these crops to Baltimore to sell.

The boat was called Sally Lloyd, named after one of the colonel’s daughters. Captain Auld, my master’s son-in-law, was the captain of the boat. The crew was made up of the colonel’s slaves named Peter, Isaac, Rich, and Jake. These slaves were highly respected by the others because being allowed to see Baltimore was a big deal for them.

Colonel Lloyd kept between three and four hundred slaves on his main plantation and many more on his other nearby farms. The closest farms to the main plantation were called Wye Town and New Design.
