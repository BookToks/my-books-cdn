Colonel Lloyd had a big, beautiful garden that needed four men plus a head gardener, Mr. M’Durmond, to take care of it. This garden was probably the coolest thing about the place. In the summer, people traveled from far away—like Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis—to see it. The garden grew lots of different fruits, from tough apples grown in the north to delicate oranges from the south.

The garden also caused a lot of problems on the plantation. Its delicious fruit was a big temptation for the hungry boys and older slaves who lived there. Most of them couldn’t resist trying to steal some. Almost every day in the summer, a slave got whipped for stealing fruit. To stop this, the colonel tried many tricks. The last and most effective one was covering the fence with tar. If a slave had any tar on them, it meant they had been in the garden or tried to get in. If caught, the chief gardener whipped them badly. This trick worked well because the slaves became as afraid of tar as they were of getting whipped. They knew it was impossible to touch tar without getting dirty.

The colonel also had a fancy set of riding gear. His stable and carriage house looked like the big horse rental places in cities. His horses were top quality, strong and well-bred. In his carriage house, he had three beautiful coaches, three or four light carriages called gigs, and other stylish carriages called dearborns and barouches.
