We didn’t have enough to live on. So, we had to survive by depending on our neighbors.

We did this by begging and stealing, whichever worked when we needed it. Both felt just as okay to us. Many times, we were almost starving, even though there was plenty of food rotting in the safe and smokehouse. Our kind mistress knew about it, but she and her husband would still pray every morning, asking God to bless their food and supplies!

Even though slaveholders are usually bad, we rarely meet one who has no respect at all. My master was one of those rare ones. I can’t say he ever did anything good. His main trait was being mean, and if he had any other qualities, they were controlled by his meanness. He was mean, and like most mean people, he couldn’t hide it.

Captain Auld wasn’t born a slaveholder. He was a poor man who only owned a small boat. He got all his slaves through marriage, and adopted slaveholders are the worst. He was cruel but also scared. He tried to be in charge but wasn’t strong. Sometimes he was strict, other times he was lazy. Sometimes he spoke to us like a fierce leader, other times like someone who was lost and confused.

He never did anything on his own. He might have seemed powerful, except for his weak ears. Whenever he tried to act noble, his meanness showed through. He acted like a born slaveholder, but since he wasn’t one, he was awkward. He wasn’t even good at pretending. He wanted to trick others but didn’t have the skill. With nothing inside himself, he copied others, and because of that, he was always inconsistent. This made people look down on him—even his own slaves.
