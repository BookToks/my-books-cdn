Right then, I saw more clearly than ever how slavery hurt both the slaves and the slave owners.

After we were all counted and valued, it was time to divide us. I don’t have the words to explain how scared and upset we slaves felt. Our whole lives were about to be decided. We had no say at all, just like the animals we were treated like. The white men only had to say one word, and no matter how much we begged or prayed, they would break apart the closest friends and family forever.

Besides the pain of being separated, we were all terrified of ending up with Master Andrew. Everyone knew he was very cruel. He was a drunk and had wasted much of his father’s property because he didn’t care. We all thought it was just as bad to be sold to traders in Georgia as to be owned by him, because we knew what would happen if we were with Master Andrew—and that scared us all deeply.

I was more worried than most other slaves. I had known what it was like to be treated kindly, but they hadn’t. They had barely seen anything outside their hard lives.

They were truly people full of sadness and pain. Their backs had been whipped so much they hardly felt it anymore. Mine was still soft because when I lived in Baltimore, I was whipped very little. I had one of the kindest masters and mistresses you could find. The thought of leaving them to live with Master Andrew made me very scared. Just a few days before, he showed how cruel he was by grabbing my little brother by the throat, throwing him down, and stomping on his head with his boot until blood came from his nose and ears. This made me very worried about what would happen to me.
