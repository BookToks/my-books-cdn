I had two sisters and one brother who lived with me, but because we were separated from our mother early on, we almost forgot we were family. I looked for a home somewhere else and was sure I wouldn’t like any place less than the one I was leaving.

If I found hard times, hunger, beatings, and no clothes in my new home, at least I knew I wouldn’t have avoided them by staying. I had already dealt with these things at my old master’s house, so I believed I could handle them anywhere, especially in Baltimore. I felt about Baltimore like the saying, “being hanged in England is better than dying naturally in Ireland.”

I really wanted to see Baltimore. Cousin Tom didn’t talk much, but he made me want to go there by telling me how great it was. No matter what I showed him at the Great House, he said Baltimore had even better and stronger things. Even the Great House and its pictures were nothing compared to buildings in Baltimore. I wanted to go so badly that I thought seeing it would make up for losing any comfort. I left without feeling sad and with big hopes for being happy.

We sailed from Miles River to Baltimore on a Saturday morning. I only remembered the day of the week because back then I didn’t know the dates or months. When the boat started moving, I walked to the back to take what I hoped was the last look at Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. Then I went to the front of the boat and spent the rest of the day looking ahead, more interested in what was coming than what was near or behind.
