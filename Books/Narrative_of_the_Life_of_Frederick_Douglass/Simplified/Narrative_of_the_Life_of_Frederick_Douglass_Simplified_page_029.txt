The slaves chosen to go to the Great House Farm to get their monthly allowance were very excited. On their way, they would sing loudly through the thick old woods for miles, showing both their biggest happiness and deepest sadness. They made up songs as they walked, not caring about the rhythm or tune. Whatever they felt, they sang out—sometimes in words, sometimes just sounds.  

Sometimes they sang sad feelings in a happy way, and happy feelings in a sad way. In all their songs, they included something about the Great House Farm. Especially when they were leaving home, they sang loudly and proudly: “I am going away to the Great House Farm! O, yea! O, yea! O!”  

They sang these words together as a chorus. To many, the words might sound like nonsense, but to them, the words had a deep meaning. I have sometimes thought that just hearing these songs would show people how terrible slavery was more than reading long books about it.  

When I was a slave, I didn’t understand the deep meaning of these rough and confusing songs. I was part of it, so I didn’t see or hear things the way others might. The songs told a sad story that was too much for me to fully get at the time. They were loud, long, and deep sounds that carried the prayers and cries of people full of pain and suffering.
