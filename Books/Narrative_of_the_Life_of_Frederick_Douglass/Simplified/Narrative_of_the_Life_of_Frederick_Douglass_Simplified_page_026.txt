A man named Noah Willis was in charge of Wye Town. Mr. Townsend was in charge of New Design. These two, along with the overseers of more than twenty other farms, got advice and instructions from the managers of the main plantation. This main place was like the headquarters. It was the center of control for all twenty farms. If overseers had disagreements, they were solved here. If a slave did something very bad, acted out, or tried to run away, they were brought here, whipped badly, put on a boat, taken to Baltimore, and sold to a slave trader like Austin Woolfolk as a warning to others.

At this place, slaves from all the farms got their monthly food and yearly clothes. The men and women slaves got eight pounds of pork or the same amount of fish each month, plus one bushel of cornmeal. Every year, they got two rough linen shirts, one pair of linen pants, one jacket, one pair of winter pants made from rough cloth, one pair of stockings, and one pair of shoes. All this probably cost less than seven dollars. The food and clothes for slave children were given to their mothers or older women who took care of them. Kids who couldn’t work in the fields didn’t get shoes, stockings, jackets, or pants. They only got two rough linen shirts a year. When those wore out, they went without clothes until the next time they got new ones. Kids between seven and ten years old were often almost naked in every season.

Slaves didn’t get beds, except maybe one rough blanket each, and only the men and women got those. But not having beds wasn’t the biggest problem. They had less trouble without beds than with not having enough time to sleep. After working all day in the fields, most of them had to wash clothes, fix things, and cook. They had little or no tools to help with this, so they lost a lot of their sleeping time just getting ready for the next day’s work. When all that was done, old and young, men and women, married or single, all lay down together on the cold, damp floor. Each covered themselves with their poor blankets and slept until the driver’s horn called them back to work.
