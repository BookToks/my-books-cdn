The lesson I learned from the conversation was that the truth can affect even a slaveholder’s conscience. From Sheridan, I heard a strong fight against slavery and a powerful defense of human rights.

Reading these papers helped me say what I thought and respond to the reasons people gave to support slavery. But while this helped with one problem, it caused a worse one. The more I read, the more I hated the people who owned me. I saw them as nothing but thieves who came from their homes, traveled to Africa, stole us from our homes, and made us slaves in a strange land. I hated them for being both cruel and mean.

As I kept thinking about this, I felt exactly what Master Hugh said would happen when I learned to read—I became unhappy and my soul hurt in a way I couldn’t explain. Sometimes, I even felt that learning to read was a bad thing, not a good one. It showed me how bad my life was, but gave me no way to fix it. It was like seeing a deep hole with no ladder to climb out.

In my pain, I wished I was like the other slaves who didn’t understand things. I often wished I was an animal. I would rather be the lowest reptile than feel the way I did. Anything to stop thinking! It was this constant thinking about my situation that hurt me the most.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it because everything around me reminded me. The idea of freedom had woken me up and wouldn’t let me rest. Freedom was everywhere—in every sound and every sight. It was always there, making me feel even worse about my terrible life. I saw everything with that feeling, heard everything with that feeling, and felt everything with that feeling.
