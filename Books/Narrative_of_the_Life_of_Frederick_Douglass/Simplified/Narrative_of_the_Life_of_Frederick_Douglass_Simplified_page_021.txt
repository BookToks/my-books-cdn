She died when I was about seven years old, on one of my master’s farms near Lee’s Mill. I wasn’t allowed to be with her when she was sick, when she died, or at her burial. She was gone long before I even knew about it.

Because I never really had her kind and caring presence, I felt about the same as if a stranger had died when I heard the news.

She left suddenly and never told me who my father was. People whispered that my master was my father, but I don’t know if that’s true. Whether it is or not doesn’t matter much because the law says that children of slave women belong to the same status as their mothers. This law exists mostly so slaveholders can satisfy their own bad desires and make money from it. This way, a slaveholder can be both master and father to some slaves.

I know about cases like this, and it’s important to say these slaves suffer more than others. Their white mistresses always find something wrong with them and rarely let them do anything right. The mistress is happiest when these slaves get whipped, especially if she thinks her husband favors his mixed-race children over his black slaves. 

Often, the master has to sell these slaves because his white wife demands it. It may seem cruel for a man to sell his own children like property, but sometimes that’s the only way to stop worse cruelty. If he doesn’t sell them, he has to whip them himself or watch one white son tie up his brother, who looks almost like him, and beat him. If he speaks out, people say he’s just being a biased father, which only makes things worse for him and the slave he wants to protect.
