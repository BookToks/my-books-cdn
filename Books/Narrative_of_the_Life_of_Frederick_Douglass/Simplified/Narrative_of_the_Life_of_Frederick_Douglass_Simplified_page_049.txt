Mary’s head, neck, and shoulders were badly cut and hurt. I have often touched her head and found it full of painful sores from being whipped by her mean mistress. I don’t know if her master ever whipped her, but I saw Mrs. Hamilton being very cruel.  

I was at Mr. Hamilton’s house almost every day. Mrs. Hamilton would sit in a big chair in the middle of the room, with a heavy whip next to her. Almost every hour, one of the slaves would have blood from her whipping.  

When the girls walked by, she would say, “Move faster, you black gip!” and hit them on the head or shoulders with the whip, often making them bleed. Then she would say, “Take that, you black gip! If you don’t move faster, I’ll make you!”  

Besides the cruel whipping, the slaves were almost always hungry. They rarely got a full meal. I saw Mary fighting with pigs to get scraps thrown in the street. Mary was kicked and cut so much that people called her “pecked” more than by her real name.
