I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot County, Maryland. I don’t know my exact age because I’ve never seen any real record of it. Most slaves don’t know their ages, just like horses don’t know theirs. Most slave owners want to keep it that way. I’ve never met a slave who knew their exact birthday. Usually, they guess by things like planting time, harvest time, or different seasons.

Not knowing my age made me sad even when I was a kid. White children could tell how old they were, but I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t allowed to know. I wasn’t allowed to ask my master about it. He thought it was wrong and rude for a slave to ask questions like that, and it showed they were too curious. The best guess I have is that I’m between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years old. I figured this out because I heard my master say in 1835 that I was about seventeen then.

My mother’s name was Harriet Bailey. She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey, who were both Black.
