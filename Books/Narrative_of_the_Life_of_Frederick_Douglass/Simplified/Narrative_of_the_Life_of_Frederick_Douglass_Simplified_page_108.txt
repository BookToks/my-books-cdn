I knew that Master Hugh didn’t really need the money that night. So, I decided to go to the camp meeting and pay him the three dollars when I got back. I stayed at the camp meeting one day longer than I planned. But as soon as I returned, I went to see him to pay what he said I owed.

He was very angry and could barely control his anger. He said he was thinking about giving me a hard whipping. He wanted to know how I dared to leave the city without asking his permission. I told him I had rented my time, and since I paid him what he asked, I didn’t think I had to ask him when or where I could go. 

This answer upset him. After thinking for a moment, he told me I shouldn’t rent my time anymore. He said if I did, the next thing would be me running away. He also told me to bring my tools and clothes home right away. I did that, but instead of finding work like I usually did, I didn’t do any work all week. I did this to get back at him.

On Saturday night, he asked me for my week’s pay, like usual. I told him I had no pay because I didn’t work that week. We almost started fighting. He yelled and said he was determined to catch me. I didn’t say a word, but I was ready to defend myself if he hit me. He didn’t hit me but said he would make sure I had work from now on.

I thought about it all day Sunday. Then I decided that on September third, I would try again to get my freedom. I had three weeks to get ready for my escape.
