This story was completely written by him. Considering how long and dark his life was as a slave, and how little chance he had to learn after he was freed, I think it shows how smart and strong he is. Anyone who reads it without feeling sad, angry about slavery and those who support it, and wanting to stop this awful system right away must have a hard heart. They must be the kind of person who trades slaves and doesn’t care about people’s souls. I believe everything he says is true. Nothing was written to hurt anyone, nothing was made up, and it doesn’t even tell the worst parts about slavery.

Frederick Douglass’s experience as a slave wasn’t unusual. His life wasn’t the hardest, but it was a good example of how slaves were treated in Maryland. People agree that slaves there were fed better and treated less cruelly than in places like Georgia, Alabama, or Louisiana.

Many slaves suffered way more than he did, and only a few had it easier. Still, his situation was awful. He was punished terribly and his mind was hurt even more. Even though he was smart and had big dreams, he was treated like an animal, even by people who said they believed in Jesus. He was always at risk of terrible things happening to him, had no one to help or advise him when he needed it most, and his darkest times were filled with fear and no hope.
