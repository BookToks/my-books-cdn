The man who beats cows during the week stands in church on Sunday and says he follows the gentle Jesus. The man who takes my money at the end of the week meets me on Sunday morning to teach me how to live and be saved. The man who sells my sister for prostitution acts like he cares about being pure. The man who says it’s a religious duty to read the Bible stops me from learning to read the name of the God who made me.

The man who talks about marriage as something holy steals its true meaning and lets people fall into bad behavior. The person who defends family values is the same one who breaks up families—separating husbands and wives, parents and kids, brothers and sisters—leaving homes empty and sad. We see thieves preaching against stealing, and cheaters warning against cheating. Men are sold to build churches, women are sold to support religion, and babies are sold to buy Bibles for poor people—all for God’s glory and saving souls!

The bell for slave auctions rings at the same time as the church bell, and the sad cries of slaves are drowned out by the happy shouts of their religious owners. Religious revivals and slave trading happen side by side.

The slave prison and the church are close to each other. You can hear the chains clinking in the prison and hear prayers and hymns in the church at the same time. The people who sell human bodies and souls set up right next to the pulpit, and they help each other. The slave dealer gives his dirty money to support the church, and the church covers up his horrible business with a mask of Christianity. Here, religion and robbery work together—devils dressed as angels, and hell pretending to be heaven.
