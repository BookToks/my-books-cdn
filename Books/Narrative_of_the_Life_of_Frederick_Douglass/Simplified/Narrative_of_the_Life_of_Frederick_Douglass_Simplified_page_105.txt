I respect those brave men and women for their courage, and I admire them for openly admitting that they helped slaves escape, even though it put them in danger. But I don’t think this openly telling everyone is very helpful, either for themselves or the slaves running away. In fact, I believe it actually hurts the slaves who are still trying to escape.

These open confessions don’t help slaves understand their situation better, but they do help the slave owners learn more. This makes the owners more careful and stronger in catching slaves who try to run away. We have a responsibility to both the slaves still living in the South and those who have made it to freedom in the North. When we help the slaves who are escaping, we must be careful not to do anything that would make it harder for others to escape.

I want the cruel slave owners to stay completely in the dark about how slaves are running away. I want them to feel like invisible enemies are always nearby, ready to take back their frightened slaves. Let the owners feel lost and scared, like they could get hurt at any moment while chasing after a runaway. We shouldn’t help the tyrants by giving them any clues or showing them how to find the slaves who are escaping.

But enough about that. Now I will tell my own story about how I escaped. I am the only one responsible for what happened, and no one else should be blamed.

At the beginning of 1838, I started feeling very restless. I couldn’t see why I should keep giving all the money I earned each week to my master.
