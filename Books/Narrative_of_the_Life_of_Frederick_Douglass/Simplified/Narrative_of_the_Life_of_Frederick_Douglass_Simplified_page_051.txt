She started following her husband’s rules. She became even stricter about stopping me from learning than he was. She didn’t just want me to follow the rules; she wanted to do even more to stop me.

The thing that made her the angriest was seeing me with a newspaper. She thought that was the biggest danger. I’ve seen her rush at me, looking furious, and snatch the paper away because she was so scared. She was smart, and she soon understood that education and slavery could not go together.

After that, she watched me very closely. If I stayed alone in a room for a while, she would suspect I had a book and make me explain myself right away. But it was already too late. By teaching me the alphabet, she had started something she couldn’t stop.

The way I learned best was by making friends with the white boys I met on the street. I turned as many of them as I could into teachers. With their help, given at different times and places, I finally learned to read. When I was sent on errands, I always took my book with me. I would finish part of my errand quickly so I could have time to study before coming back. I also carried bread with me, which we always had enough of at home. I gave the bread to hungry little boys, and in return, they gave me the much more valuable bread of knowledge. I want to thank some of those boys, but I can’t say their names because it might get them into trouble. Teaching slaves to read is almost a crime in this country.
