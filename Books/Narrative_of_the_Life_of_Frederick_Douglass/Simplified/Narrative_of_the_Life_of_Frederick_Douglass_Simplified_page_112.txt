I had only been in New York for a few days when Mr. Ruggles found me and kindly took me to his boarding house at the corner of Church and Lespenard Streets. Mr. Ruggles was very busy with the important Darg case and helping other runaway slaves find ways to escape. Even though many people were watching him closely, he was smarter than his enemies.

Soon after I went to live with Mr. Ruggles, he asked me where I wanted to go because he thought it was not safe for me to stay in New York. I told him I was a calker and wanted to find work. I thought about going to Canada, but he said no and suggested I go to New Bedford because he thought I could find work there.

At this time, Anna, my fiancée, came to New York. I had written to her right after I arrived, even though I had no home or help, telling her I had escaped safely and asking her to come. A few days after she arrived, Mr. Ruggles invited the Reverend J. W. C. Pennington, who, with Mr. Ruggles, Mrs. Michaels, and a few others watching, married us. He gave us a marriage certificate that said: “THIS may certify, that I joined together in holy matrimony Frederick Johnson and Anna Murray, as man and wife, in the presence of Mr. David Ruggles and Mrs. Michaels. JAMES W. C. PENNINGTON. New York, Sept. 15, 1838.” 

Anna was free, and I had changed my name from Frederick Bailey to Frederick Johnson.
