Three days after I arrived, I found a job loading oil onto a small ship. The work was new, dirty, and hard for me, but I did it happily and willingly. Now, I was my own boss. It was a special feeling that only someone who was once a slave can understand. This was the first job where I kept all the money I earned. There was no Master Hugh ready to take it away from me. That day, I worked with more joy than ever before. I was working for myself and my new wife. It felt like the start of a new life.

After finishing that job, I looked for work calking ships, but the white calkers didn’t want to work with me because of my skin color, so I couldn’t get that job. Since my trade didn’t help me get work right away, I stopped trying to calk and got ready to do any kind of job I could find. Mr. Johnson was kind and let me use his wood-horse and saw, and soon I found plenty of work. No job was too hard or dirty for me. I was ready to saw wood, shovel coal, carry wood, sweep chimneys, or roll oil barrels. I did these jobs for almost three years in New Bedford before people in the antislavery movement knew me.

About four months after I came to New Bedford, a young man asked me if I wanted to subscribe to the “Liberator” newspaper. I said yes, but since I had just escaped slavery, I couldn’t pay for it right away. Eventually, I did subscribe. The paper came every week, and I read it with strong feelings.
