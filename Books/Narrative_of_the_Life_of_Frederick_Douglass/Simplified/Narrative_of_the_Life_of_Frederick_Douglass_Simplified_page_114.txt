I started in Baltimore with the name “Stanley.” When I got to New York, I changed my name to “Frederick Johnson,” thinking that would be the last time. But when I arrived in New Bedford, I had to change it again.

The reason was that there were so many people named Johnson in New Bedford, it was hard to tell us apart. I let Mr. Johnson pick a new name for me, but I told him he couldn’t take away my first name, “Frederick,” because I wanted to keep some part of who I am. Mr. Johnson had been reading a book called “Lady of the Lake,” and suggested the last name “Douglass.” Since then, I’ve been called “Frederick Douglass,” and because most people know me by that name, I keep using it.

I was pretty disappointed by what I saw in New Bedford. I had believed that people in the North were very different from the South, but I was wrong. When I was a slave, I thought the North was poor and didn’t have many comforts or luxuries, unlike the rich slave owners in the South. I guessed this because northern people didn’t own slaves. I thought they were about as poor as the poor people in the South who didn’t have slaves. I believed that without slaves, there couldn’t be much wealth or culture. So, I expected to find the North full of rough, hardworking people living very simply, without any of the luxury or fancy things the southern slave owners had.
