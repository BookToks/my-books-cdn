Of course, no white man wanted to speak up for me against the white young men. Even those who might have felt sorry for me weren’t brave enough to do it. It took a kind of courage they didn’t have. At that time, even showing kindness to a Black person was called abolitionism, and that label caused big problems. People in that area and time shouted, “Damn the abolitionists!” and “Damn the niggers!” Nothing was done to help me, and probably nothing would have been done even if I had been killed. That was the way things were, and still are, in the Christian city of Baltimore.

Master Hugh saw that I couldn’t get help, so he didn’t let me go back to Mr. Gardner. He kept me with him, and his wife took care of my wound until I got better. Then he put me to work in the shipyard where he was a foreman, working for Mr. Walter Price. I started calking right away and quickly learned how to use the tools.

Within a year after leaving Mr. Gardner’s, I was making the highest wages paid to the best calkers. I had become important to my master because I earned him six to seven dollars a week. Sometimes I made nine dollars a week, earning a dollar and a half a day. After learning to calk, I found my own jobs, made my own deals, and collected my own pay. Life became much easier, and my situation was better.

When there was no calking work, I didn’t do anything. During these free times, my old thoughts about freedom would come back. When I worked for Mr. Gardner, I was so busy and worried about my life that I almost forgot about my freedom.
