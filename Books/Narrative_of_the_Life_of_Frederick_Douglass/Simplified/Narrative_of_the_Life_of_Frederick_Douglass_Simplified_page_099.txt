I had to listen to about seventy-five men all the time. I had to treat all of them like bosses. Whatever they said was the rule. My situation was really hard. Sometimes, I needed a dozen pairs of hands to help me. People called me in so many different ways in just one minute. Three or four voices would shout at me at the same time. It was like—“Fred, come help me move this wood.”—“Fred, carry that wood over there.”—“Fred, bring that roller here.”—“Fred, go get a fresh can of water.”—“Fred, help saw off the end of this wood.”—“Fred, hurry and get the crowbar.”—“Fred, hold the end of this timber.”—“Fred, go to the blacksmith and get a new punch.”—“Fred, run and bring me a cold chisel.”—“Fred, help start a fire fast under that steam-box.”—“Hey, come turn this grindstone.”—“Come on! Move and pull this timber forward.”—“Why don’t you heat up some pitch?”—“Hey! Hey! Hey!” (Three voices at once.) “Come here! Go there! Stay where you are! If you move, I’ll hit you!” 

This was how I learned for eight months. I might have stayed longer, but I had a terrible fight with four white apprentices. They almost knocked my left eye out, and hurt me badly in other ways. Here’s what happened: At first, white and black ship carpenters worked together like nothing was wrong. Everyone seemed okay with it. Many black carpenters were free men. Things seemed to be going well.

Then suddenly, the white carpenters stopped working. They said they wouldn’t work with free black carpenters anymore. They said if free black carpenters kept working, they would take over the trade and poor white men would lose their jobs.
