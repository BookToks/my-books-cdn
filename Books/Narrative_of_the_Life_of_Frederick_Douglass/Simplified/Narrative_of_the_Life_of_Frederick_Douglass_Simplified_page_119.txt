APPENDIX.

After reading the story again, I realize that I might have sounded like I’m against all religion. Some people who don’t know my beliefs could think that. So, I want to explain myself clearly.

When I talk about religion in a negative way, I’m only talking about the kind of religion that supports slavery in this country. I am not talking about true Christianity. There is a huge difference between the Christianity here and the Christianity that Jesus taught.

If you accept the religion here as good and holy, then you have to reject the true Christianity as bad and corrupt. Being friends with one means being against the other.

I love the true Christianity of Jesus because it is pure, peaceful, and fair. But I hate the fake Christianity here that supports slavery, hurts women, steals children, and is full of lies and unfairness.

There is no good reason to call the religion here Christianity. It’s the biggest lie and trick ever. It’s like stealing God’s good name to help evil.

I feel sick when I see all the fancy religious shows and the terrible contradictions around me. We have slave owners as ministers, people who hurt women as missionaries, and child stealers as church members.
