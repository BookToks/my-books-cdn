My time on this plantation now feels more like a dream than something real.

Our house was very close to Chesapeake Bay, which was always full of ships from all over the world. Those beautiful white ships looked wonderful to free people, but to me, they were like ghosts that reminded me how bad my life was.

Often, on quiet summer Sundays, I would stand alone on the high banks by the bay. I would watch the many ships sailing out into the big ocean, feeling sad and crying. Seeing those ships always affected me a lot. I would talk to them in my own way, even though no one was around except God. I would say: “You are free and sailing away, but I am stuck in chains and a slave! You move happily with the wind, but I move sadly under the whip! You are like angels of freedom flying all over the world, but I am trapped in iron chains! I wish I were free! I wish I could be on one of your decks, safe and protected!

But between me and you are these rough waters. Keep going, keep going.

I wish I could go too! If only I could swim or fly! Why was I born a man, but treated like an animal? The happy ship is gone; it’s far away now. I am left here in the worst kind of slavery. God, please save me! God, free me! Is there a God? Why am I a slave? I will run away. I won’t put up with this. Whether I get caught or not, I will try. I might as well die trying as die here. I only have one life to lose. I’d rather be killed running than die standing still. Just think: if I go one hundred miles straight north, I will be free! Should I try? Yes! With God’s help, I will. I can’t live and die as a slave. I will take to the water. This very bay will carry me to freedom.
