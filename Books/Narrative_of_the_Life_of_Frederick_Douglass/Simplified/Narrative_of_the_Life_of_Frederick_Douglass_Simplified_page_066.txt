They really liked coming there to stay because, while he starved us, he fed them a lot. We had three or four preachers visiting at the same time. The ones who came most often when I lived there were Mr. Storks, Mr. Ewery, Mr. Humphry, and Mr. Hickey. I also saw Mr. George Cookman at our house. We slaves liked Mr. Cookman a lot.

We thought he was a good man. We believed he helped Mr. Samuel Harrison, a very rich slave owner, free his slaves. We also thought Mr. Cookman was working to free all slaves. When he came to our house, we were always called in for prayers. Sometimes when the other preachers came, we were called in, and sometimes we weren’t. Mr. Cookman paid more attention to us than the others. He couldn’t be around us without showing he cared, and even though we were not very smart, we could tell.

When I lived with my master in St. Michael’s, there was a white young man named Mr. Wilson who wanted to start a Sabbath school to teach slaves how to read the New Testament. We only met three times before Mr. West and Mr. Fairbanks, who were leaders, came with sticks and other weapons, chased us away, and told us we couldn’t meet again. That’s how our little Sabbath school ended in the so-called religious town of St. Michael’s.

I said my master used religion to justify being cruel. For example, I saw him tie up a lame young woman and whip her with a heavy cowhide on her bare shoulders until blood dripped down. To explain why he did this, he quoted a Bible verse: “He that knoweth his master’s will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.” He would keep that poor young woman tied up like that for four or five hours at a time.
