The fastest eater got the most food; the strongest person got the best spot; and hardly anyone left the trough feeling full.

I was probably about seven or eight years old when I left Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. I was really happy to leave. I’ll never forget how excited I was when I found out that my old master, Anthony, decided to send me to Baltimore to live with Mr. Hugh Auld. He was the brother of Captain Thomas Auld, who was my old master’s son-in-law. I learned this news about three days before I left. Those three days were some of the happiest days I ever had. I spent most of the time in the creek, washing off the dirt from the plantation and getting ready to leave.

The reason I wanted to clean myself up wasn’t because I was proud. I washed mainly because Mrs. Lucretia told me I had to get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before going to Baltimore. She said the people there were very clean and would laugh at me if I looked dirty. Also, she was going to give me a pair of trousers, but I wasn’t allowed to wear them unless I cleaned myself well first. Just the idea of having my own pair of trousers was amazing! That was enough to make me scrub off all the dirt and dead skin. I worked hard because I finally had something to look forward to.

Normally, kids feel tied to their homes, but that wasn’t true for me. Leaving wasn’t hard at all. My home wasn’t a nice place; it didn’t feel like home to me. When I left, I didn’t feel like I was giving up anything good. My mother was dead, and my grandmother lived far away, so I hardly ever saw her.
