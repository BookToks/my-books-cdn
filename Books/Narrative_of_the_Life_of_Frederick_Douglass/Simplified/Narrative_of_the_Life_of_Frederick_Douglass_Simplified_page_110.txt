I knew I couldn’t get away without the worst punishment, and I had to be kept where I couldn’t escape. It wasn’t hard to imagine the terrible things that would happen if I failed. The pain of being a slave and the joy of being free were always on my mind. It was a matter of life and death for me. But I stayed strong, and on September 3, 1838, I broke free from my chains and made it to New York without any trouble. How I did it—where I went, and how I traveled—I can’t explain for the reasons I mentioned before.

People often ask me how I felt when I finally reached a free state. I’ve never been able to give a good answer. It was the most exciting moment I’ve ever had. I think I felt like a sailor saved from pirates by a friendly ship. Right after I got to New York, I wrote to a close friend saying I felt like someone who escaped a den of hungry lions. But that feeling didn’t last long. Soon, I felt scared and alone again. I could still be caught and sent back to slavery.

That fear was enough to kill my excitement.

But the loneliness got to me even more. I was surrounded by thousands of people, but I was still a complete stranger. I had no home or friends, even though many around me were my own people—children of the same God. Still, I didn’t dare tell anyone about my sad situation. I was scared to talk to anyone because what if I spoke to the wrong person? There were kidnappers who made money by trapping runaways, waiting like wild animals ready to catch their prey.
