I have seen him tie her up early in the morning and whip her before breakfast. Then he would leave, go to his store, come back at dinner, and whip her again, cutting her already hurt skin with his cruel whip.

The reason he was so mean to "Henny" is because she was almost helpless. When she was a child, she fell into a fire and burned herself badly. Her hands were so burned that she couldn’t use them. She could only carry heavy things. She was a burden to her master, and since he was a cruel man, she annoyed him all the time. He seemed like he wanted her gone. He even gave her away to his sister once, but she didn’t want to keep her. Finally, my master said he was “setting her adrift” to take care of herself. Here was a man who said he was religious, but he was throwing out a helpless girl to starve and die! Master Thomas was one of those slave owners who said they kept slaves to take care of them.

My master and I didn’t get along well.

He thought I wasn’t good for what he wanted. He said living in the city had made me bad. It had almost ruined me for anything good and made me fit for bad things. One of my biggest mistakes was letting his horse run away and go to his father-in-law’s farm about five miles away. Then I had to go get it. The reason I let this happen was because I could always get something to eat there.

Master William Hamilton, my master’s father-in-law, always gave his slaves enough food. I never left hungry, no matter how quickly I had to come back. Master Thomas said he couldn’t take it anymore. I had lived with him for nine months, and during that time, he had whipped me many times, but it didn’t help.
