This place was taken care of by two slaves—old Barney and young Barney—who were father and son. Their only job was to look after the horses.

But it wasn’t an easy job. Colonel Lloyd was very strict about how his horses were treated. If he thought the horses weren’t cared for properly, he punished the people in charge very harshly. No excuse could save them if the colonel thought they weren’t paying attention to the horses. This made old Barney and young Barney’s job very stressful.

They never knew when they might get punished. Sometimes they were whipped even when they didn’t deserve it, and other times they escaped punishment when they should have been punished. Everything depended on how the horses looked and how Colonel Lloyd was feeling when he saw them.

If a horse didn’t move fast enough or hold its head high, it was blamed on the keepers. It was hard to stand near the stable door and hear Colonel Lloyd complain about the keepers. He would say things like, “This horse wasn’t rubbed or brushed enough. It wasn’t fed right; the food was too wet or too dry, given too early or too late. The horse was too hot or too cold. It had too much hay and not enough grain, or too much grain and not enough hay. Old Barney didn’t take care of the horse properly and left it to his son.”

No matter how unfair these complaints were, the slaves had to stay silent. Colonel Lloyd didn’t allow slaves to talk back. When he spoke, they had to listen quietly and be scared. I once saw Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man about fifty or sixty years old, take off his hat, kneel on the cold, wet ground, and get more than thirty lashes on his bare back at one time.
