To make things even worse, my grandmother was very old now. She had outlived my old master and all his children. She had seen the start and end of all of them. Her current owners didn’t think she was worth much anymore. Her body was hurting from old age, and she was becoming helpless. So, they took her to the woods, built her a small hut with a little mud chimney, and left her there alone to take care of herself. They basically kicked her out to die!

If my poor old grandmother is still alive, she lives in total loneliness. She spends her days remembering and mourning the loss of her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. As the slave poet Whittier said,  
“Gone, gone, sold and gone  
To the rice swamp dank and lone,  
Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,  
Where the noisome insect stings,  
Where the fever-demon strews  
Poison with the falling dews,  
Where the sickly sunbeams glare  
Through the hot and misty air:—  
Gone, gone, sold and gone  
To the rice swamp dank and lone,  
From Virginia hills and waters—  
Woe is me, my stolen daughters!”

Her home is empty now. The children who once sang and danced around her are all gone.

She feels her way in the dark, trying to find a drink of water.

Instead of hearing her children’s voices, during the day she hears the sad coos of a dove, and at night the scary screams of an owl.
