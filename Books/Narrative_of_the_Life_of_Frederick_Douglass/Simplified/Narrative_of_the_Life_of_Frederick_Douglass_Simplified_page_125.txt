LIFE OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS 107  
“A loud, angry man who stole from others,  
Who ate rich meats like mutton, veal, and beef,  
But never helped poor Black people in pain,  
Still talked about heavenly union.  

“The preacher said, ‘Don’t love the world,’  
He winked and shook his head;  
He took from Tom, Dick, and Ned,  
Cut their food and clothes and bread,  
But still talked about heavenly union.  

“Another preacher cried and talked  
About someone who cared for sinners:  
He tied old Nanny to a tree,  
Beat her until she bled,  
And prayed for heavenly union.  

“Two more opened their cruel mouths,  
And took children away with their hands;  
Their kids sat with fancy toys,  
While Black backs and stomachs were starved,  
All to keep up heavenly union.  

“Jack took from others and gave  
To people who lived wild lives,  
Who dressed slick like shiny snakes,  
And stuffed their mouths with sweet cakes;  
And this was called union.”  

I truly hope this little book helps people understand the American slave system better,  
And speeds up the happy day when millions of my brothers and sisters in chains will be free—  
I trust in truth, love, and justice to help me succeed in my small efforts—  
And I promise again to work hard for this sacred cause.  

I sign this,  
FREDERICK DOUGLASS.
