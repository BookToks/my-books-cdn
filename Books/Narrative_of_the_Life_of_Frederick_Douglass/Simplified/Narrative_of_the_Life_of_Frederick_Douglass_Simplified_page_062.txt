Master Thomas said he would never let me come back again.

He thought the gap between him and his brother could never be crossed.

I felt sorry that I didn’t at least try to run away because it’s much easier to escape from a city than from the countryside.

I sailed from Baltimore to St. Michael’s on a boat called the Amanda, with Captain Edward Dodson. During the trip, I carefully watched which way the steamboats went to get to Philadelphia. Instead of going down the bay, when they reached North Point, they went up the bay, heading northeast. I knew this was very important information. My decision to run away came back strong. I decided to wait only until the right chance came. When it did, I was ready to leave.
