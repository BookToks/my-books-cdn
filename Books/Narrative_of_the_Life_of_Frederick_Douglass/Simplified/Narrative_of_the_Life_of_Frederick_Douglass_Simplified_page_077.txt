I managed to get pretty far toward the woods when Covey saw me and shouted for me to come back, warning me about what he would do if I didn’t. I ignored his calls and threats and went to the woods as fast as my weak body would let me. I thought he might catch me if I stayed on the road, so I walked through the woods, staying far enough from the road so he wouldn’t see me, but close enough so I wouldn’t get lost.

Not long after, I got too weak to keep going. I fell down and rested for a long time. Blood was still coming from the cut on my head. For a moment, I thought I might bleed to death, but the blood made my hair stick together and stopped the bleeding. After lying there for about 45 minutes, I gathered my strength and kept going through mud and bushes, barefoot and without a hat. I hurt my feet almost every step. After walking about seven miles, which took me around five hours, I finally reached my master’s store.

I must have looked terrible. From my head to my feet, I was covered in blood. My hair was full of dust and blood, and my shirt was stiff with it. I probably looked like someone who had just escaped from wild animals. I went to my master, asking him kindly to protect me. I told him everything as best as I could, and sometimes it seemed like he felt sorry for me.

But then he walked around, trying to defend Covey by saying he thought I deserved it. He asked me what I wanted. I told him I wanted a new home because if I lived with Mr. Covey again, I would only live to die under him. Covey would definitely kill me; it was almost certain. My master laughed at the idea that Covey was dangerous.
