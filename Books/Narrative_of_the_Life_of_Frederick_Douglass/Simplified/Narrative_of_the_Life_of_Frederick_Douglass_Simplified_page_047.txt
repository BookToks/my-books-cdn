Right when I was making progress, Mr. Auld found out and immediately told Mrs. Auld to stop teaching me. He said it was illegal and dangerous to teach a slave to read. He said, “If you give a slave an inch, he will take a mile. A slave should only know how to obey his master. Learning would ruin even the best slave. If you teach that slave to read, you won’t be able to control him anymore. He would become impossible to manage and useless to his master. It wouldn’t help him at all, but would only make him unhappy and want more.”

His words hit me hard. They woke up feelings inside me that had been sleeping and started a whole new way of thinking. It was like a new and clear understanding of something I had struggled with before—the power white people had to keep black people enslaved. I saw it as a smart trick, and I respected it. From that moment, I knew how to move from slavery to freedom. It was exactly what I wanted, and I got this idea when I least expected it.

Even though I was sad to lose the help of my kind mistress, I was happy about the important lesson I accidentally learned from my master.

I knew it would be hard to learn without a teacher, but I started with hope and strong determination to learn how to read no matter how tough it was. The way he spoke so seriously and tried to warn his wife about the dangers of teaching me showed me he really believed what he was saying.
