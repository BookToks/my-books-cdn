We had to keep things quiet about our Sabbath school. Our religious teachers at St. Michael’s didn’t know that instead of spending the Sabbath wrestling, boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to learn how to read God’s will. They actually preferred us playing those rough games instead of acting like smart, good, responsible people. It makes me angry to remember how Messrs. Wright Fairbanks and Garrison West, both leaders at church, along with others, came at us with sticks and stones and broke up our peaceful Sabbath school at St. Michael’s—all calling themselves Christians! They said they followed Jesus, but their actions said otherwise. But I’m getting off track.

I held my Sabbath school at the house of a free Black man. I won’t say his name because it might cause him trouble, even though this happened ten years ago. At one time, I had over forty students who really wanted to learn. They were all ages, mostly men and women. I look back on those Sundays with so much happiness. They were very special days for me.

Teaching my fellow slaves was the best thing I ever did. We loved each other, and leaving them at the end of the Sabbath was really hard. When I think about how these precious people are still trapped in slavery, it’s overwhelming. It makes me wonder if God is really fair, and why He doesn’t stop the oppressors and save the victims. These people didn’t come to Sabbath school because it was cool, and I didn’t teach because it was popular. Every moment they spent there, they risked being caught and whipped with thirty-nine lashes.
