PREFACE.

In August 1841, I went to an anti-slavery meeting in Nantucket, where I was lucky to meet FREDERICK DOUGLASS, who wrote the story you are about to read. Most people there didn’t know him. He had just escaped from being a slave in the South and was curious to learn more about the abolitionists—people who wanted to end slavery—because he had only heard a little about them while he was still a slave. He came to the meeting even though he was living in New Bedford at the time.

This was a very lucky event! Lucky for millions of slaves who wanted freedom. Lucky for the fight to end slavery and for freedom everywhere. Lucky for his country, which he has helped so much. Lucky for many friends who care about him because of all he has been through and because he always thinks about those still in slavery. Lucky for many people across the country who have learned about slavery from him and have been moved by his powerful words. Lucky for Frederick himself, because this meeting helped him start his important work, made him feel alive and ready, and showed the world he was a real man. It set him on the path to fight against slavery and help free the oppressed.
