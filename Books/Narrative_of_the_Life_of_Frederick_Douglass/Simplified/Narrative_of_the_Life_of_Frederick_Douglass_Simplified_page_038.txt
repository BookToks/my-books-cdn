The first call was given. Demby didn’t answer but stayed where he was. The second and third calls were made, and nothing changed. Then Mr. Gore, without talking to anyone or giving Demby another chance, raised his musket and aimed at him. In a moment, poor Demby was gone. His broken body disappeared, and blood and brains stained the water where he had stood.

Everyone on the plantation felt shocked and scared, except Mr. Gore. He stayed calm. Colonel Lloyd and my old master asked him why he did such a thing. He said (as best as I remember) that Demby was out of control. He was setting a bad example for the other slaves, and if Mr. Gore didn’t act, all order on the plantation would be lost. He said if one slave refused to obey and wasn’t punished, others would do the same, which could lead to slaves becoming free and whites becoming slaves. Mr. Gore’s explanation was accepted. He kept his job as overseer on the main plantation.

People started to know Mr. Gore as an overseer. No court ever looked into his terrible crime. It happened in front of slaves, who couldn’t sue or speak against him. So, the man who did this horrible murder never got punished or blamed by the community.

Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael’s, Talbot County, Maryland, when I left. If he’s still alive, he probably lives there now. If so, he is still respected and treated well, as if he hadn’t done something so awful.
