After thinking about it a lot, he finally agreed to give it a try. Since then, he has worked as a speaker for either the American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. He has worked really hard, and his success in changing people’s minds, gaining supporters, and getting the public interested has been much better than anyone expected when he first started.

He has been kind and humble but still strong and confident. As a speaker, he is great at expressing feelings, making jokes, comparing ideas, copying voices, using strong arguments, and speaking smoothly. He has both intelligence and emotion, which helps him teach others and win their support. We hope he stays strong and keeps growing in grace and understanding, so he can keep helping people who are suffering, both here and far away.

It’s amazing that one of the best defenders of slaves today is a runaway slave named FREDERICK DOUGLASS. Also, the free black people in the United States are well represented by CHARLES LENOX REMOND, who has impressed crowds on both sides of the Atlantic with his powerful speeches. People who hate and look down on black people should feel ashamed and stop saying that black people are naturally worse. All they need is time and chances to reach the highest level of human greatness.
