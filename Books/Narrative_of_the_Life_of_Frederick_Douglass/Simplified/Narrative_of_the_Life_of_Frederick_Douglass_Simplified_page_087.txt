But to go back to Mr. Freeland and my time working for him. Like Mr. Covey, he gave us enough food, but unlike Mr. Covey, he also gave us enough time to eat. He worked us hard, but only from sunrise to sunset. He wanted a lot of work done, but he gave us good tools to use. His farm was big, but he hired enough workers to get the job done easily compared to many of his neighbors. My treatment while working for him felt like heaven compared to what I went through with Mr. Edward Covey.

Mr. Freeland only owned two slaves.

Their names were Henry Harris and John Harris. The rest of the workers he hired. These included me, Sandy Jenkins,* and Handy Caldwell. Henry and John were smart, and soon after I arrived, I got them really interested in learning to read. This excitement spread to the others too. They found some old spelling books, and they insisted that I start a Sunday school. I agreed and spent my Sundays teaching my fellow slaves how to read.

None of them knew their letters when I got there. Some slaves from nearby farms heard about this and also came to learn how to read.

Everyone who came knew that they had to be respectful and careful.

*This is the same Sandy Jenkins who gave me the roots to stop me from being whipped by Mr. Covey. He was a clever guy. We often talked about the fight with Covey, and every time, he said my success was because of the roots he gave me. This kind of belief is common among less educated slaves. They often think a slaveâ€™s death is caused by magic or trickery.
