It’s sad to think that the very people who support your story and protect you are actually going against the law. Keep going, my friend, until you and others like you—who have been saved from a dark prison—can make these brave, illegal actions into official laws.

Then New England can break away from a cruel Union and be proud to be a safe place for people who are treated unfairly. We won’t just hide those who are rejected or pretend nothing is happening while they are hunted. Instead, we will make the land of the Pilgrims a true safe home for the oppressed.

We will welcome escaped slaves so loudly that everyone in the South will hear it, and those who are suffering will feel hope when they think of Massachusetts.

I hope that day comes soon!

Always yours, WENDELL PHILLIPS.

FREDERICK DOUGLASS.
