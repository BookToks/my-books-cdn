PREFACE ix It might be fair to ask if any other group of people in the world could have gone through the pain, suffering, and horrors of slavery without becoming more broken than African slaves. People did everything they could to hurt their minds, confuse them, damage their morals, and erase any sign that they were part of humanity. But still, they have amazingly carried the heavy burden of terrible slavery for hundreds of years!

To show how slavery affects white people and to prove that they don’t handle it any better than black people, DANIEL O’CONNELL, a famous fighter for freedom and equality, shared a story in a speech in Dublin on March 31, 1845. He said, “No matter what fancy name you give it, slavery is awful. It always hurts the best parts of a person. An American sailor was shipwrecked on the coast of Africa and kept as a slave for three years. When he was found, he was almost like an animal—he couldn’t think clearly and had even forgotten his own language. He could only speak a strange mix of Arabic and English that no one understood, not even him. This shows how badly slavery can affect a person, no matter their skin color!”

Even though this was an extreme example, it proves that white slaves can suffer just as much as black slaves.

Mr. DOUGLASS wisely decided to write his own story, in his own words, and as best as he could, instead of having someone else do it.
