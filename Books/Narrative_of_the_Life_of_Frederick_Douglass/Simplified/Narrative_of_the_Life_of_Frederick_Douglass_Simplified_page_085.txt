Covey was always addicted to two things. One was open and honest, and we always knew where to find him. The other was tricky and could only be understood by people smart enough to see through his lies.

Another good thing about my new master was that he didn’t pretend to be religious. In my opinion, this was a big advantage. I strongly believe that religion in the South was just a cover for terrible crimes. It was used to justify horrible cruelty and to hide the worst lies and actions of slave owners. If I were ever forced back into slavery, being owned by a religious master would be the worst thing that could happen to me. From all the slave owners I met, the religious ones were the meanest, cruelest, and most cowardly.

Unfortunately, I didn’t just have one religious slave owner—I lived in a community full of them.

Near Mr. Freeland lived Rev. Daniel Weeden, and nearby was Rev. Rigby Hopkins. Both were ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church. Mr. Weeden owned a woman slave whose name I forgot. Her back was kept raw from being whipped for weeks by this cruel religious man. He would hire workers and believed that no matter how a slave behaved, it was a master’s duty to whip them sometimes to show who was in charge. This was his rule, and he followed it.

Mr. Hopkins was even worse than Mr. Weeden. He was proud of how he controlled slaves. One strange thing about his way of controlling slaves was that he would whip them before they even did anything wrong.
