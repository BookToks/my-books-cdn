That afternoon, we got to Annapolis, the capital of the state. We only stopped for a little while, so I didn’t have time to go on land. It was the first big town I had ever seen, and even though it looked small compared to some New England factory towns, I thought it was amazing for its size—bigger and fancier than the Great House Farm!

We reached Baltimore early on Sunday morning and got off at Smith’s Wharf, which wasn’t far from Bowley’s Wharf. We had a lot of sheep on the boat, and after helping to take them to Mr. Curtis’s slaughterhouse on Louden Slater’s Hill, a man named Rich, who worked on the boat, showed me my new home on Alliciana Street near Mr. Gardner’s shipyard in Fells Point.

Mr. and Mrs. Auld were both home and met me at the door with their little son, Thomas. I was supposed to take care of Thomas. Here, I saw something I had never seen before: a white face full of kindness. It was my new mistress, Sophia Auld. I wish I could explain how happy I felt when I saw her. It was a new and strange feeling that made my future seem bright. Little Thomas was told that I was his Freddy, and I was told to take care of him. That’s how I started my new job, feeling hopeful.

Leaving Colonel Lloyd’s plantation was one of the most important moments in my life. It’s possible, maybe even very likely, that if I hadn’t been moved from that plantation to Baltimore, I wouldn’t be sitting here free today, writing my story. Instead, I might still be trapped in the terrible chains of slavery.
