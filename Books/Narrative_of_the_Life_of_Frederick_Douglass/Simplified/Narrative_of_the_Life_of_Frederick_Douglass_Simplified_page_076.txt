The fan stopped, of course; everyone had their own work to do, and no one could do someone else’s job while doing their own.

Mr. Covey was at the house, about one hundred yards from the yard where we were working. When he heard the fan stop, he came straight over to us.

He quickly asked what was wrong. Bill said I was sick and no one was bringing wheat to the fan. By then, I had crawled under the fence to get out of the sun and feel better. Mr. Covey asked where I was. One of the workers told him. He came over, looked at me for a bit, and asked what was wrong. I tried to explain, but I was too weak to talk well.

He suddenly kicked me hard in the side and told me to get up. I tried but fell back down. He kicked me again and told me to rise. I tried again and stood up, but when I bent down to get the tub I was using, I stumbled and fell again.

While I was down, Mr. Covey grabbed a stick Hughes had been using and hit me hard on the head. It made a big wound and blood came out. He told me again to get up. I didn’t try to move because I had decided to let him do whatever he wanted.

After a little while, my head started feeling better. Mr. Covey left me alone. At that moment, I decided for the first time to go to my master, complain, and ask for help. To do this, I had to walk seven miles that afternoon, which was really hard for me.

I was very weak, both from the kicks and hits I had taken and from feeling sick. Still, I waited for a chance when Covey was looking away and then started walking toward St.
