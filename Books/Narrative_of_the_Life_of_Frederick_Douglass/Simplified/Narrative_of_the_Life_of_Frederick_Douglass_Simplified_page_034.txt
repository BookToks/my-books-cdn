Because of these facts, slaves usually say they are happy and that their masters are kind when asked about their lives and their masters. Slave owners would sometimes send spies to listen to what slaves really thought about their lives. This made slaves follow the rule, “keep your mouth shut to stay safe.” They hid the truth to avoid trouble, showing they are just like other people.

If slaves said anything about their masters, it was mostly good, especially when talking to strangers. When I was a slave, people often asked if my master was kind, and I never said no. I didn’t feel like I was lying because I judged kindness by what other slave owners did around us.

Slaves, like everyone else, have their own opinions and biases. They usually think their own masters are better than others’. Sometimes, slaves even fought over whose master was the best, even when that wasn’t true. At the same time, they would complain about their masters when talking alone. This happened on our plantation too.

When Colonel Lloyd’s slaves met Jacob Jepson’s slaves, they often argued about their masters. Colonel Lloyd’s slaves said he was the richest, while Mr. Jepson’s slaves said he was the smartest and the best man.
