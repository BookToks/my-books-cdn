Now I’m going to talk about the time in my life when I planned and finally managed to escape from slavery. But before I tell you all the details, I want to say that I won’t share everything about it. 

There are a couple of reasons for this. First, if I told every little detail, some people might get into serious trouble. Second, if I explained everything, slave owners would become even more watchful. That would make it harder for other slaves to escape. 

I really wish I could tell you all about my escape because I know many people are curious. It would also make my story more interesting. But I have to keep some things secret. I’d rather face any accusations than risk closing any chance for another slave to break free from slavery. 

I have never agreed with the way some of our friends out west have talked openly about what they call the underground railroad. By talking so openly, they have actually made it more like an “upperground railroad.”
