Trying to explain it would be pretty useless. The paper became like my food and drink. It set my soul on fire. Its care for my people in slavery—its harsh criticism of slave owners—its honest telling of the truth about slavery—and its strong attacks on those who supported it—gave me a joy I had never felt before!

I hadn’t been reading the “Liberator” for long before I understood the ideas, actions, and spirit of the anti-slavery movement. I joined the cause. I couldn’t do much, but I did what I could with a happy heart, and I was never happier than when I was at an anti-slavery meeting. I didn’t say much at the meetings because others said what I wanted to say so much better. But when I went to an antislavery meeting in Nantucket on August 11, 1841, I felt really pushed to speak, and Mr. William C. Coffin, who had heard me talk before, encouraged me a lot. It was hard for me, and I didn’t want to do it. I felt like a slave, and talking to white people was very scary. I spoke for only a little while, but then I felt free and said what I wanted easily. Since then, I have worked hard to help my people, and I’ll let others decide how well and how much I have done.
