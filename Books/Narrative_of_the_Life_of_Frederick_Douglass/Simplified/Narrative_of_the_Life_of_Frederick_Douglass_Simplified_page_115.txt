Because of what I thought before, anyone who knows what New Bedford looks like can easily guess how clearly I saw that I was wrong.

In the afternoon of the day I got to New Bedford, I went to the docks to look at the ships. I saw proof of lots of money everywhere. At the docks and in the water, there were many big, fancy ships that were well kept and looked great. On both sides, there were huge granite warehouses filled to the top with everything people need to live comfortably. Almost everyone was working, but it was much quieter than what I was used to in Baltimore. I didn’t hear loud singing, bad language, or anyone being whipped. Everything seemed calm and smooth.

Everyone seemed to know their job and worked seriously but happily. They cared about what they were doing and felt proud of themselves. To me, this was very strange. After the docks, I walked around the town, amazed by the beautiful churches, nice houses, and well-kept gardens. It showed a level of wealth, comfort, style, and class I had never seen in slave-owning Maryland.

Everything looked clean, new, and nice. I saw almost no broken-down houses or poor people like the ones I had seen in Hillsborough, Easton, St. Michael’s, and Baltimore. The people looked stronger, healthier, and happier than those in Maryland. For once, I felt happy seeing so much wealth without any extreme poverty. But the most surprising and interesting thing to me was the situation of the Black people, many of whom, like me, had come here to escape from people hunting them.
