Moving to Baltimore was the start of everything good that happened to me later. I have always seen it as the first clear sign of the kind help from above that has stayed with me and brought me many blessings. I thought it was pretty special that I was chosen. There were many slave kids who could have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore. Some were younger, some older, some my age. But I was picked out of all of them, and I was the only choice.

Some people might say I’m being silly or full of myself for thinking this was a special act from God to help me. But I would be lying to my true feelings if I didn’t believe it. I’d rather be honest with myself, even if others make fun of me, than to lie and hate myself.

From as far back as I can remember, I always believed that slavery wouldn’t hold me forever. Even in my darkest times as a slave, this strong hope and faith never left me. It was like angels helping me get through the hard times. This good feeling came from God, and I thank and praise Him for it.
