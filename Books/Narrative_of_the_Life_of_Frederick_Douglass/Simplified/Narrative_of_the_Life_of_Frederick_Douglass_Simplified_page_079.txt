I found Sandy, an old adviser. He told me seriously that I had to go back to Covey, but before I did, I needed to go with him to another part of the woods. There, he showed me a special root. He said if I carried some of it on my right side all the time, no one, not even Mr. Covey or any white man, could beat me. He said he had carried it for years and never got hit since then. At first, I didn’t believe that just carrying a root could do that, so I didn’t want to take it. But Sandy was very serious and said it couldn’t hurt if it didn’t help. To make him happy, I finally took the root and carried it on my right side like he said. This was Sunday morning. I started home right away, and when I got to the yard gate, Mr. Covey came out on his way to church. He spoke kindly to me, told me to drive the pigs away from a nearby lot, and then he went to church.

Mr. Covey’s strange behavior made me start to believe the root Sandy gave me might actually work. If it had been any day except Sunday, I would have thought the root was the only reason for Mr. Covey’s kindness. Even on Sunday, I was beginning to think the root was more than just a simple plant. Everything went fine until Monday morning. That morning, the root’s power was really tested. Before daylight, I was called to rub, curry, and feed the horses. I did it gladly. But while I was throwing down some hay from the loft, Mr. Covey came into the stable with a long rope. Just as I was halfway out of the loft, he grabbed my legs and tried to tie me up. When I realized what he was doing, I jumped quickly, but since he was holding my legs, I fell hard on the stable floor.
