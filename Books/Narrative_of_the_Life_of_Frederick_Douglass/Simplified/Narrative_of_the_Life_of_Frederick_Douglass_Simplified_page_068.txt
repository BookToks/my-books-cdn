He decided to send me away to be “broken,” as he called it. So, he rented me out for one year to a man named Edward Covey. Mr. Covey was a poor farmer who rented the land where he lived and also rented the slaves who worked on it.  

Mr. Covey was famous for breaking young slaves, and this made him very valuable. Because of his reputation, he could get his farm worked for less money than others. Some slave owners thought it was worth letting Mr. Covey have their slaves for a year just so they would be trained, without paying anything else. This made it easy for him to find young slaves to work for him.  

Besides his natural qualities, Mr. Covey was also very religious. He was a devoted member and leader in the Methodist church. This made his reputation as a “slave-breaker” even stronger.  

I knew all this because a young man who had been there told me about it. Even so, I agreed to the change gladly because I knew I would get enough to eat, which is very important to a hungry person.
