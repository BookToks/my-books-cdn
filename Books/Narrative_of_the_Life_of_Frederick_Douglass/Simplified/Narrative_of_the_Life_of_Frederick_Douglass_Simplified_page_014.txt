Is it possible to imagine a worse society than this?

The way southern slave owners act, even though they say they are religious, is clearly shown in the story that follows. Their behavior is far from good. By its very nature, it has to be very harmful. Mr. Douglass’s words about this are supported by many honest witnesses.

He says, “A slaveholder who says he is a Christian is lying. He is a serious criminal. He steals people. Nothing else matters as much as this.” Reader, are you on the side of the slaveholders or with the people they have hurt? If you support the slaveholders, then you are against God and humanity. If you support the victims, what are you ready to do for them?

Be faithful, watchful, and never stop trying to free every enslaved person. No matter what happens or what it costs, make your clear message—both religious and political—“NO COMPROMISE WITH SLAVERY! NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!”

WM. LLOYD GARRISON.
