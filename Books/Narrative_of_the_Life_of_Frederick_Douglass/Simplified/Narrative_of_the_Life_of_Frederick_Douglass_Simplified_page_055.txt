I told him that I was. The good Irishman looked really upset when I said that. He told the other man it was sad that such a nice little guy like me had to be a slave forever. He said it was wrong to keep me locked up. They both told me to run away to the north, where I could find friends and be free. 

I acted like I didn’t care about what they said and pretended I didn’t understand. I was scared they might trick me. Some white men have told slaves to run away, but then caught them to get a reward and gave them back to their owners. I was afraid these men might do the same. But I still remembered their advice and decided I would run away someday. I waited for the right time when it would be safe. I was too young to leave right away, and also wanted to learn how to write because I might need to write my own pass. I kept hoping that one day I’d get a good chance to escape.

In the meantime, I would learn to write.

I got the idea to learn from being at Durgin and Bailey’s shipyard. I often saw the ship carpenters cutting wood and then writing on it the name of the part of the ship it was for. If a piece was for the left side of the ship, they would mark it “L.” For the right side, they wrote “S.” If it was for the front left, it was “L. F.” For front right, “S. F.” For back left, “L. A.” And for back right, “S. A.” I quickly learned what these letters meant when I saw them on the wood. I started copying them, and soon I was able to write all four letters.
