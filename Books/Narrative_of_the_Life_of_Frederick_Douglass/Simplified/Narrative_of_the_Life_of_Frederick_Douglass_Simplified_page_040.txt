While I’m talking about violent things that happened when I was on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, I’ll tell you about another event that happened around the same time Mr. Gore killed Demby.

Colonel Lloyd’s slaves often spent part of their nights and Sundays fishing for oysters to make up for the small amount of food they were given. One old man who belonged to Colonel Lloyd went too far and ended up on Mr. Beal Bondly’s land while fishing.

Mr. Bondly got angry about this and came down to the shore with his gun. He shot the poor old man.

The next day, Mr. Bondly went to see Colonel Lloyd. I don’t know if he was going to pay for the man or explain why he did it. But anyway, this terrible event was quickly covered up. Almost no one talked about it, and nothing was done. Even some young white boys said it was worth half a cent to kill a “nigger” and half a cent to bury one.
