Everything feels sad and dark. Death is very close. Now, when my old body hurts and feels weak, when my head droops down toward my feet, when the start and end of life come together, and when helpless babies and tired old people are similar — at this important time, the time when children should show love to their aging parent — my poor old grandmother, who raised twelve children, is all alone in a small hut with just some dying embers. She stands, sits, stumbles, falls, groans, and dies — but none of her children or grandchildren are there to wipe the sweat from her face or to bury her. Won’t a fair God notice this?

About two years after Mrs. Lucretia died, Master Thomas got married again. His new wife was Rowena Hamilton, the oldest daughter of Mr. William Hamilton. Master Thomas now lived in St. Michael’s. Soon after his marriage, he and Master Hugh had a fight. To punish his brother, Master Thomas took me away to live with him in St. Michael’s. This was another painful separation for me. But it wasn’t as bad as when the property was divided because by then, Master Hugh and his once kind wife had changed a lot. Brandy ruined him and slavery changed her, so I didn’t feel like I lost much by leaving them.

But I wasn’t attached to them. I was attached to the little Baltimore boys. They taught me many good things, and I was still learning from them. Leaving them was really hard, especially because I didn’t think I would ever see them again.
