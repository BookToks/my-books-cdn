“Really, God! And these are the people who serve at your altar, God of justice!

People who place their hands with prayer and blessings on Israel’s holy symbol of light.

“What? They preach but kidnap people?

They give thanks but steal from their own poor and suffering?

They talk about freedom but lock up the captives tight?

“What? Followers of your loving Son, who came to help and save the homeless and rejected, but instead they chain and exploit the tired and enslaved!

Pilate and Herod are friends!

The chief priests and rulers work together, just like before!

Is that church truly just and holy if it helps the ones who steal from others?”

The Christianity in America is like the old scribes and Pharisees. They put heavy burdens on people but won’t help lift a finger themselves. They do everything to be seen by others. They love the best seats at parties and places of honor in the synagogues, and want to be called “Teacher” by everyone.

But woe to them, hypocrites! They block people from entering God’s kingdom and don’t enter themselves. They take advantage of widows and pretend to pray for show; because of this, they will be punished even more.

They travel far and wide to make one person follow them, but when they do, they make that person even worse than themselves.
