I left Master Thomas’s house and went to live with Mr. Covey on January 1, 1833. This was the first time in my life that I worked in the fields. I felt clumsy and unsure, like a country boy who didn’t know how to act in a big city.

After just one week, Mr. Covey gave me a very hard whipping. It cut my back, made it bleed, and left big raised marks on my skin about the size of my little finger. Here’s what happened:

One cold January morning, Mr. Covey sent me to the woods to get some wood. He gave me a team of oxen that were not trained. He told me which ox was the “in-hand” one and which was the “off-hand” one. Then he tied a big rope around the horns of the “in-hand” ox and gave me the other end. He told me to hold the rope tight if the oxen started running.

I had never driven oxen before, so I was very awkward. I made it to the edge of the woods without much trouble. But a short way into the woods, the oxen got scared and ran wildly. They crashed the cart into trees and over stumps. I thought I would get hurt badly or even die.

After running for a long time, the oxen finally overturned the cart by smashing it hard against a tree. Then they ran into thick bushes. I don’t know how I didn’t get hurt. I was all alone in a thick forest, in a place I didn’t know. My cart was broken, and the oxen were stuck in the bushes with no one to help me.

After working hard for a long time, I managed to fix my cart, free the oxen, and put them back to work pulling the cart again.
