I lived with Master Hugh’s family for about seven years. During that time, I learned how to read and write. To do this, I had to come up with different tricks because I didn’t have a regular teacher. My mistress started teaching me kindly, but her husband told her to stop. After that, she didn’t want anyone else to teach me either.

At first, my mistress didn’t treat me badly. She wasn’t mean right away. She had to get used to having power over me before she could treat me like I was less than human.

My mistress was a kind and gentle woman. When I first came to live with her, she treated me how she thought people should treat each other. But once she became a slave owner, she didn’t seem to understand that I was seen as just property, not a person. Treating me like a human was wrong and dangerous to her in that system.

Slavery hurt her as much as it hurt me. When I arrived, she was caring and warm. She would cry for others’ pain, give food to the hungry, clothes to the poor, and comfort to anyone sad. But slavery took all this away from her. Her kind heart turned hard, and her gentle nature changed into something fierce and cruel. The first sign of this change was when she stopped teaching me.
