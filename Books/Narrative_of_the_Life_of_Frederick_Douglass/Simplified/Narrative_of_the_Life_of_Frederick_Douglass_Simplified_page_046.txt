My new mistress was exactly as kind and caring as she seemed when I first saw her at the door. She had never had a slave before me, and before she got married, she worked hard to support herself. She was a weaver by trade, and because she worked so much, she didn’t lose her kindness like many others did under slavery. I was really surprised by how good she was. I didn’t know how to act around her. She was nothing like any other white woman I had met. I couldn’t treat her the way I usually treated white ladies.  

The old way I was taught to act — being super quiet and respectful like a slave was supposed to be — didn’t work with her. She didn’t like it, and it made her uncomfortable. She didn’t think it was rude for a slave to look her in the face. Even the lowest slave felt comfortable around her, and everyone felt better after seeing her. She always smiled like an angel, and her voice was calm and nice.  

But, sadly, her kind heart didn’t last long. The terrible power she had over slaves soon started to change her. That happy look in her eyes turned angry, her sweet voice became harsh and scary, and her angelic face turned mean.  

Not long after I started living with Mr. and Mrs. Auld, she kindly began teaching me the ABCs. After I learned those, she helped me spell simple words with three or four letters.
