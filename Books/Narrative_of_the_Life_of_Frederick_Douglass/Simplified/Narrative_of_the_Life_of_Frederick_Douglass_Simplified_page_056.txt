After that, whenever I met a boy who I knew could write, I would tell him I could write as well as he could. The next thing he would say was, “I don’t believe you. Let me see you try.” Then I would write the letters I had learned and ask him to do better. This way, I got lots of writing practice, which I might not have had any other way.

During this time, I used the board fence, brick wall, and pavement as my notebook. My pen and ink were just pieces of chalk. With these, I mainly learned how to write.

Then, I started copying the Italics in Webster’s Spelling Book until I could write them all without looking. By then, my little Master Thomas had gone to school, learned to write, and filled many copy-books. He brought them home, showed them to some neighbors, and then put them away.

My mistress went to class meetings every Monday afternoon at the Wilk Street meetinghouse and left me to take care of the house. When she was gone, I spent time writing in the empty spaces in Master Thomas’s copy-books, copying what he had written. I kept doing this until I could write almost exactly like Master Thomas.

After many years of hard work, I finally learned how to write.
