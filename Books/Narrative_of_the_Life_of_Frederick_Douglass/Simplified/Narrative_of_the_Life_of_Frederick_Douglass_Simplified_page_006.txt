I will never forget his first speech at the convention—the strong feelings it woke up in me—the big impact it had on the surprised crowd—and the applause that went on from the start to the end of his great words. I think I never hated slavery as much as I did then; for sure, I understood more clearly how terrible it was for the people who suffered under it. There he was, strong and smart, naturally a great speaker, and with a soul that seemed almost angelic—but still a slave, yes, a runaway slave—afraid for his life, hardly able to believe that any white person in America would help him just because of love and kindness!

He could have been very successful as a thinker and a good person—he only needed a little education to become a great example for society and a blessing to his people—but by law, by what people said, by the slave rules, he was treated like property, like an animal, just something owned by someone else.

A good friend from New Bedford convinced Mr. Douglass to speak at the convention. He came up to the stage feeling shy and nervous, which anyone would feel in such a new and important situation. After saying sorry for not knowing much and reminding everyone that slavery was a terrible place to learn anything good, he told some stories about his life as a slave. During his speech, he shared many noble ideas and powerful thoughts.
