Having slaves to serve him was new and unexpected for him. He owned slaves but didn’t know how to control them. He couldn’t manage us by force, fear, or trickery. We rarely called him “master”; instead, we usually said “Captain Auld,” or didn’t call him anything at all. I’m sure our behavior made him feel awkward and annoyed. Our lack of respect confused him a lot. He wanted us to call him master but wasn’t strong enough to make us do it. His wife tried to make us call him that, but it didn’t work.

In August 1832, my master went to a Methodist camp meeting in Bay-side, Talbot County, and found religion. I hoped this would make him free his slaves or at least treat us better and kinder.

But I was disappointed. It didn’t make him kind or free us. If anything, it made him even more cruel and hateful. I believe he was worse after he became religious than before. Before, he relied on his own bad nature to be cruel, but after, he used religion to justify his harshness. He acted very religious. His house was a place for prayer.

He prayed all the time—morning, noon, and night. He quickly became important in his church, becoming a leader and speaker. He worked hard in church events and helped convert many people. His house became a place where preachers stayed.
