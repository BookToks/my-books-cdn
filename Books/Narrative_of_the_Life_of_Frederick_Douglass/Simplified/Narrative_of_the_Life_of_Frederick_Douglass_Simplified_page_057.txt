Not long after I moved to Baltimore, my old master’s youngest son Richard died. About three and a half years later, my old master, Captain Anthony, died too. He only left behind his son Andrew and daughter Lucretia to share his things. He died suddenly while visiting his daughter in Hillsborough and didn’t leave a will about who should get what. 

Because of this, they had to figure out how much everything was worth so it could be split fairly between Lucretia and Andrew. I was called to be “valued” along with all the other property. This made me feel really angry about slavery. I finally understood how badly I was treated. Before this, I had tried not to think about it too much, but now it hit me hard. 

I left Baltimore feeling very sad and worried. I took a ride with Captain Rowe on the schooner Wild Cat, and after about a day, I got close to where I was born. I had been away from there for almost five years. I still remembered the place well, even though I was only about five when I left to live with my old master on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. Now, I was about ten or eleven years old.

At the valuation, everyone was treated the same. Men, women, old and young, married or single, were all put in the same group as horses, sheep, and pigs. Horses and men, cows and women, pigs and children were all ranked together. Everyone had to go through the same rude and uncomfortable inspection, no matter their age or status.
