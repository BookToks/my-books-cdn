I say this carefully: killing a slave or any Black person in Talbot County, Maryland, is not seen as a crime by the courts or the people there.

Mr. Thomas Lanman, from St. Michael’s, killed two slaves. He killed one by hitting him in the head with a hatchet. He even bragged about what he did, laughing and saying he was doing a favor for his country. He said that when others did the same, they would get rid of “the d——d niggers.”

Near where I used to live, Mrs. Giles Hicks killed my wife’s cousin, a girl about fifteen or sixteen years old. She hurt her badly, breaking her nose and breastbone with a stick, and the girl died a few hours later. The girl was buried quickly, but then the coroner dug her up to check. He said she died from being beaten badly.

The reason Mrs. Hicks killed the girl was that the girl was watching Mrs. Hicks’s baby that night. The baby cried, but the girl fell asleep because she hadn’t been sleeping well for days. Mrs. Hicks and the baby were in the same room. When Mrs. Hicks saw the girl wasn’t moving, she jumped out of bed, grabbed a stick by the fireplace, and hit the girl, breaking her nose and breastbone, which caused her death.

This terrible murder did shock some people in the community, but not enough to punish Mrs. Hicks. They made a warrant to arrest her, but it was never used. So, she not only avoided punishment but didn’t even have to face court for her awful crime.
