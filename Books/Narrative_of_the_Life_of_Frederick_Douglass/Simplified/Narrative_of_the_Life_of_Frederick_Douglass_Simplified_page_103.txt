From what I’ve seen during my time as a slave, whenever my situation got better, it didn’t make me happier. Instead, it made me want to be free even more and think of ways to escape.

To keep a slave happy, you have to make sure they don’t think too much. You have to block their ability to see what’s right and wrong, and stop them from using their reason. A slave must not notice anything wrong with slavery. They have to believe slavery is okay, and that only happens when they stop being treated like a person.

I was getting one dollar and fifty cents a day. I worked for it, earned it, and it was supposed to be mine. But every Saturday night, I had to give all that money to Master Hugh. Why? Not because he earned it, helped me earn it, or had any right to it. He just had the power to take it from me. It’s like a pirate stealing on the high seas—they have no right, but they can force you to give it up.
