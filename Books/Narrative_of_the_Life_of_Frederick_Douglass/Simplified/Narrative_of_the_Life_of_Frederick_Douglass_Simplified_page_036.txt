Mr. Hopkins didn’t stay as overseer for very long. I don’t know exactly why, but I think he wasn’t strict enough for Colonel Lloyd.

After Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Austin Gore took over. He had all the qualities needed to be a top overseer. Mr. Gore had worked for Colonel Lloyd before on one of the smaller farms, and he proved he was good enough to be in charge of the main farm.

Mr. Gore was proud, determined, and smart. But he was also cruel and tough. He was the perfect person for the job, and the job was perfect for him. It gave him a chance to use all his skills, and he seemed very comfortable in it.

He could make even the smallest look, word, or action from a slave seem like disrespect, and he would punish them for it. Slaves were not allowed to talk back or defend themselves if accused by Mr. Gore. He believed, like many slave owners, that it was better for many slaves to be punished than for the overseer to be proven wrong in front of them.

No matter how innocent a slave was, if Mr. Gore accused them of something, they were treated as guilty and punished for sure. It was almost impossible to avoid being accused or punished while he was overseer. 

Mr. Gore wanted slaves to show him complete disrespectful obedience, but he was also willing to bow down to the master himself.
