Every Monday morning, he always made sure to whip one or more of his slaves. He did this to scare them and to warn those who had escaped. His plan was to punish even the smallest mistakes so that bigger problems wouldn’t happen. Mr. Hopkins could always find a reason to whip a slave. It would surprise someone who didn’t know about slaveholders how easy it was for them to find reasons to punish slaves. Even a look, a word, or a movement — a mistake, accident, or not being able to do something — could get a slave whipped at any time. If a slave looked unhappy, people said he had the devil in him and needed to be whipped to get it out.

If a slave spoke loudly when the master talked to him, that meant he was getting too proud and needed to be put in his place. If a slave forgot to take off his hat when a white person came near, that meant he wasn’t showing respect and should be whipped for it. If a slave tried to explain his behavior when he was told off, that was called being rude — one of the worst things a slave could do. If a slave tried to suggest a different way of doing things from what the master said, that was being too bold and needed a whipping. If a slave broke a plow while working or a hoe, it was because he was careless and had to be whipped. Mr. Hopkins always found reasons like these to use the whip and rarely missed a chance.

Every slave who had the chance to live somewhere else in the county would rather live anywhere but with this Mr. Hopkins. But at the same time, he was the man who talked about religion the most, worked hard in church events, paid close attention in meetings, and was very religious in his family. He prayed earlier, later, louder, and longer than anyone else — even though he was a cruel slave owner.
