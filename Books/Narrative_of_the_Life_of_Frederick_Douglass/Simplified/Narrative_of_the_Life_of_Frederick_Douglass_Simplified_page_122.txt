—Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You carefully pay your tithes on tiny herbs like mint, anise, and cumin, but you ignore the more important parts of the law—like justice, mercy, and faith. You should do these important things too, and not leave them out. You are blind leaders! You strain out a tiny gnat but swallow a huge camel.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of your cups and plates, but inside they are full of greed and selfishness. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful on the outside but are full of dead bones and dirt inside. You look good to people on the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and sin.

Even though this is a dark and harsh picture, I believe it is true for most so-called Christians in America. They focus on small things but ignore bigger problems. Could anything be more true for our churches? They would be upset if someone who steals sheep joined them, but they accept someone who steals people. Then they call me an unbeliever if I criticize them for this.

They follow religious rules strictly on the outside but ignore the important parts of the law—like justice, mercy, and faith. They are quick to make sacrifices but slow to show kindness. They say they love God, whom they haven’t seen, but they hate their brothers and sisters, whom they have seen. They care for people far away in other countries. They pray for them, give money to send Bibles, and send missionaries to teach them. But they ignore and look down on the people living right near them.

This is my honest opinion about the religion in this country. To be clear, when I say the religion of this land, I mean the beliefs and actions of the groups, both in the North and South, who call themselves Christian churches but are still connected to slaveholders.
