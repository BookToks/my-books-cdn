They’ll loudly talk about Christ’s reward,  
And tie up his image with a rope,  
They’ll shout and swing a hated whip,  
And sell their brother in the Lord,  
To a handcuffed heavenly union.

They’ll read and sing a holy song,  
Say a prayer that’s loud and long,  
Teach what’s right but do what’s wrong,  
Cheer their brothers and sisters,  
With words about heavenly union.

We wonder how such saints can sing,  
Or praise the Lord while on the move,  
Who shout, scold, whip, and sting,  
And hold tight to their slaves and money,  
In a guilty conscience union.

They’ll grow tobacco, corn, and rye,  
Drive, steal, cheat, and lie,  
Save treasures up in the sky,  
While making switches and cowhides fly,  
Hoping for heavenly union.

They’ll hit old Tony on the head,  
Preach and shout like a wild bull,  
Or a noisy donkey full of trouble,  
Then grab old Jacob by the hair,  
And pull hard for heavenly union.
