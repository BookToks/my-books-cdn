When I gave him my weekly pay, he would count the money, look at me with a mean, scary face, and ask, "Is this all?" He wanted every last cent and wasn’t happy with less. Sometimes, when I earned six dollars, he gave me six cents to encourage me. But it didn’t help. I thought that by giving me a little, he was admitting I deserved all of it. I felt worse after getting any money because I worried that giving me a few cents made him think he was being kind, like a “honorable robber.” I became more and more unhappy.

I was always trying to find a way to get away. When I couldn’t find a direct way, I decided to try to hire out my time to save money for escape. In the spring of 1838, when Master Thomas came to Baltimore to buy spring goods, I asked him if I could hire my time. He said no right away and told me it was just another trick to run away. He said I couldn’t go anywhere he couldn’t find me and that if I ran, he would try hard to catch me. He told me to be happy with what I had and to obey him.

He said that if I wanted to be happy, I should stop making plans for the future. He promised that if I behaved well, he would take care of me. He told me to forget about the future and depend only on him for happiness. He seemed to understand that I had to stop thinking so much to be content in slavery. But no matter what he said, and even though I tried, I kept thinking about how unfair it was that I was enslaved and how I could escape.
