Aunt Hester didn’t just break his rules by going out, but she was also caught hanging out with Lloyd’s Ned. From what he said while whipping her, that was the main reason he was so angry. If he had been a good person, you might think he was trying to protect my aunt, but people who knew him didn’t believe that.

Before he started whipping Aunt Hester, he took her to the kitchen and took off her clothes from her neck to her waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back completely bare.

Then he told her to cross her hands and called her a bad name. After she crossed her hands, he tied them with a strong rope and made her stand on a stool under a big hook in the ceiling. He tied her hands to the hook. She had to stand on her toes because her arms were stretched up all the way. He said, “Now, you bad woman, I’ll teach you to disobey me!” Then he rolled up his sleeves and started hitting her with a heavy whip. Blood soon started dripping to the floor while she screamed and he cursed.

I was so scared and shocked by what I saw that I hid in a closet and didn’t come out until it was all over. I thought I might be next. This was all new to me. I had never seen anything like it before because I always lived with my grandmother on the edge of the plantation, where she took care of the younger women’s kids. So, until now, I hadn’t seen these terrible scenes that often happened on the plantation.
