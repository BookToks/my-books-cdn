As the time to leave got closer, we felt more and more nervous. This was really a matter of life and death for us. Our determination was about to be tested fully. At that moment, I worked hard to explain every problem, clear up every doubt, calm every fear, and encourage everyone to stay strong, which was needed to succeed. I told them that half the battle was won once we started moving. We had talked long enough; we were ready to go. If we didn’t leave now, we never would. And if we didn’t plan to leave now, we might as well give up and accept being slaves. None of us were ready to give up like that. Every man stood firm, and at our last meeting, we promised again, very seriously, that we would definitely start our journey to freedom at the planned time. This was in the middle of the week, and by the end of the week, we had to leave. We went back to our work in the fields, but our hearts were full of nervous thoughts about the dangerous plan. We tried to hide how we felt, and I think we did a good job.

After a long, hard wait, Saturday morning came—the night before was when we planned to leave. I felt happy to see that day, even though it also made me a little sad. Friday night, I couldn’t sleep at all. I was probably more worried than the others because everyone agreed I was in charge of the whole plan. The success or failure of everything depended on me. The glory of winning or the shame of losing would both be mine. The first two hours of that morning were like nothing I had ever felt before, and I hope never to feel again. Early that morning, we went to the field as usual. We were spreading manure when suddenly, I was hit with a strange, overwhelming feeling. I looked at Sandy, who was nearby, and said, “We are betrayed!”
