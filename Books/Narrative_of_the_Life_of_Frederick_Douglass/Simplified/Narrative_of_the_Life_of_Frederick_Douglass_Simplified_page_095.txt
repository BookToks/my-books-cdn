In a few minutes, they managed to tie up John. Then they turned to Henry, who had come back by that time, and told him to cross his hands. “I won’t!” Henry said firmly, ready to face whatever would happen.

“Won’t you?” asked Tom Graham, the constable.

“No, I won’t!” Henry said even louder. Then two constables pulled out shiny pistols and promised they would make him cross his hands or kill him. They cocked their pistols and walked up to Henry, saying if he didn’t cross his hands, they would shoot him in the heart.

“Shoot me, shoot me!” Henry said loudly. “You can only kill me once. Shoot, shoot, and be damned! I won’t be tied!” He said this bravely, and quickly knocked the pistols out of both constables’ hands.

As he did this, everyone grabbed him, beat him for a while, and finally tied him up.

While all this was happening, I somehow got my pass and, without anyone seeing, threw it into the fire. We were all tied up now. Just as we were about to leave for Easton jail, Betsy Freeland, William Freeland’s mother, came to the door with lots of biscuits and gave some to Henry and John. Then she said to me, “You devil! You yellow devil! You made Henry and John think about running away. If it wasn’t for you, you long-legged mulatto devil, Henry and John would never have thought of it.” I didn’t say anything and was quickly taken toward St. Michael’s.

Right before the fight with Henry, Mr. Hamilton said it would be a good idea to search for the protections that he heard Frederick had written for himself and the others.
