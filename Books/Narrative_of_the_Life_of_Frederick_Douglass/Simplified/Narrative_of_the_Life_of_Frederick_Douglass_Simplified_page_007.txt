As soon as he sat down, full of hope and respect, I stood up and said that PATRICK HENRY, famous for fighting for freedom, never gave a better speech than the one we just heard from that brave runaway. I believed it then, and I still believe it now. I reminded everyone about the danger this young man faced up North—even in Massachusetts, the land of the Pilgrim Fathers and the children of revolution heroes. I asked if they would let him be taken back into slavery, no matter what the law said. Everyone shouted loudly, “NO!” Then I asked if they would help and protect him like a brother living in Massachusetts. The crowd yelled, “YES!” so strongly that even the cruel slave owners down South might hear and know that these people were determined to never betray him, to hide him, and to face whatever happened because of it.

I realized right away that if Mr. DOUGLASS could be convinced to use his time and skills to fight against slavery, it would give a big boost to the cause and also challenge the unfair bias against Black people in the North. So, I tried to give him hope and confidence to take on this difficult and unusual job, and some kind friends helped me, especially Mr. JOHN A. COLLINS, who worked with the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society and agreed with me. At first, Douglass wasn’t sure. He honestly felt he wasn’t ready for such a huge responsibility. The path he had to take was totally new, and he worried he might end up doing more harm than good.
