I have now reached a time in my life when I can remember exact dates. In March 1832, I left Baltimore and went to live with Master Thomas Auld at St. Michael’s. It had been more than seven years since I lived with him at my old master’s place on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. We were almost strangers to each other now. He was a new master to me, and I was a new slave to him. I didn’t know what kind of person he was, and he didn’t know me either. But it didn’t take long for us to get to know each other. I also met his wife just as well as I got to know him.  

They were both mean and cruel, like two people who fit well together. For the first time in over seven years, I felt the painful hunger in my stomach — a feeling I hadn’t had since leaving Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. It was already hard back then, because I never really had enough to eat. But it was much worse now, after living with Master Hugh’s family, where I always had enough good food.  

I said Master Thomas was a mean man, and he really was. Not giving a slave enough food is seen as the worst kind of meanness, even among slave owners. The rule is, no matter how bad the food is, it should at least be enough.  

That’s the idea, and in the part of Maryland where I came from, that’s usually how things are done — though sometimes there are exceptions. But Master Thomas didn’t give us enough food, whether it was bad or good. There were four of us working in the kitchen — my sister Eliza, my aunt Priscilla, Henny, and me. We were given less than half a bushel of cornmeal each week, and very little else, like meat or vegetables.
