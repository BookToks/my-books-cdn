My mother had darker skin than my grandmother or grandfather.

My father was a white man. Everyone who talked about my parents said this. Some people also said that my master was my father, but I don’t know if that’s true because no one told me. My mother and I were separated when I was a baby—before I even knew she was my mother. In the part of Maryland where I ran away from, it was normal to separate children from their mothers very early. Often, before a child turned one year old, the mother was sent to work far away on a farm, and the child was left with an old woman who was too old to work in the fields. I don’t know why they did this except maybe to stop the child and mother from loving each other. That’s what always happened.

I saw my mother only four or five times in my life, and each time was very short and at night. She worked for a man named Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles from where I lived. She walked all that way at night to see me after working all day. She was a field worker, and if a slave wasn’t in the field by sunrise, they would get whipped unless their master said it was okay. Masters rarely gave this permission, and if they did, they were called kind masters. I don’t remember ever seeing my mother during the day. She was only with me at night. She would lie down with me and help me fall asleep, but she left before I woke up. We didn’t talk much.

Death came soon and ended what little time we had together, as well as her pain and suffering.
