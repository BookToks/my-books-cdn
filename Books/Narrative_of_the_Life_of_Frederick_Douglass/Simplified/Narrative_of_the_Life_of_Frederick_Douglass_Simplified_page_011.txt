He deeply wanted freedom, and the more he thought and understood, the more unhappy he became—showing that a happy slave is impossible! He thought, felt, and reasoned even while being whipped and chained. He faced many dangers trying to escape his terrible fate, and it is amazing how he was saved and kept safe among a nation that didn’t care about him.

This story has many touching moments and powerful words, but the most exciting part is when Douglass talks about his feelings while standing by the Chesapeake Bay. He watches ships sailing away with their white sails and imagines they are alive with the spirit of freedom. Who can read that part and not feel its deep emotion and greatness?

In that moment, there is a whole library of thoughts and feelings packed in—everything that can be said against the horrible crime of slavery, which makes one person the property of another! That system is cursed because it traps the brilliant mind of a person, ruins the image of God in them, lowers people who were meant to be great down to the level of animals, and puts slave traders above everything else. Why should slavery last even one more hour? It is only evil, always evil. Its existence means people in the United States don’t fear God or care about other humans. May it be destroyed forever!
