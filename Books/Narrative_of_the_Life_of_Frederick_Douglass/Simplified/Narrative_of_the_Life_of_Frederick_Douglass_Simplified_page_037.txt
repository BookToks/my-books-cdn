He wanted to be the top overseer and worked hard until he got there. He was cruel enough to give the harshest punishments, smart enough to use tricks, and stubborn enough to ignore any guilt. Of all the overseers, the slaves feared him the most. Seeing him was upsetting; his sharp eyes caused confusion, and when he spoke loudly and sharply, the slaves felt scared and shook with fear.

Mr. Gore was a serious man. Even though he was young, he never joked, said funny things, or smiled much. His words matched his serious face perfectly. Some overseers might say a funny word to slaves sometimes, but not Mr. Gore. He only spoke to give orders and expected to be obeyed. He didn’t waste words and used his whip a lot, choosing to whip instead of talking when he could. When he whipped, it seemed like he was just doing his job and didn’t care about any consequences. He never did anything unwillingly, was always on duty, and never changed his mind. He only made promises he intended to keep. In short, he was very firm and cold.

His brutal cruelty was matched only by how calm and cool he was while doing terrible things to the slaves he was in charge of. One time, Mr. Gore tried to whip a slave named Demby, who belonged to Colonel Lloyd. After only a few lashes, Demby ran and jumped into a creek, standing there up to his shoulders, refusing to come out. Mr. Gore told him he would call him three times and if he didn’t come out by the third call, he would shoot him.
