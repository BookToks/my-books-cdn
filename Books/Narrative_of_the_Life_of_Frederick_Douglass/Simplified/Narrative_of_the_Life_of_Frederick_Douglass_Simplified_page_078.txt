Covey was really hurting me. Someone told me he knew Mr. Covey and said Mr. Covey was a good man. He said he couldn’t take me away from Mr. Covey because then he would lose a whole year’s pay. He said I belonged to Mr. Covey for one year and that I had to go back no matter what. He warned me not to tell him any more stories, or he would come after me himself. After threatening me, he gave me a big dose of medicine and said I could stay in St. Michael’s that night since it was late. But he told me I had to go back to Mr. Covey early the next morning. If I didn’t, he would catch me and whip me.

I stayed the night and followed his orders. On Saturday morning, tired and feeling awful, I left without eating breakfast or dinner the night before. I got to Covey’s around nine o’clock. Just as I was climbing over the fence between Mrs. Kemp’s fields and ours, Covey ran out with his whip to hit me again.

Before he could get to me, I got into the cornfield where the tall corn helped me hide. He looked very mad and searched for me for a long time. I don’t know why I acted that way. After a while, he gave up, probably thinking I had gone home to eat. He didn’t want to look for me anymore. I spent most of that day in the woods, stuck between two bad choices—go home and get whipped badly, or stay in the woods and possibly starve.

That night, I met Sandy Jenkins, a slave I knew a little. Sandy had a free wife who lived about four miles from Mr. Covey’s, and since it was Saturday, he was on his way to see her. I told him what was happening to me, and he kindly invited me to go with him. I went with him, talked about everything, and got his advice on what I should do next.
