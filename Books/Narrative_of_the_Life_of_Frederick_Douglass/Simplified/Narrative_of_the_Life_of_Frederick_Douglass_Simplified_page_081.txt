Covey never hit me with his finger in anger. Sometimes he said he didn’t want to catch me again. I thought, “No, you don’t need to, because you’ll end up worse off than before.” This fight with Mr. Covey was a big moment in my life as a slave. It brought back my small hope for freedom and made me feel like a man again. It reminded me that I could believe in myself and made me want to be free more than ever.

Winning that fight made me very happy, even if something bad happened afterward, even death. Only someone who has fought back against slavery with force can understand how good I felt. I felt things I never felt before. It was like coming back to life, going from the sadness of slavery to the joy of freedom. My beaten spirit got stronger, fear left me, and I became bold and defiant. I decided that even if I stayed a slave in name, I would never be a real slave again. I told everyone that any white man who tried to whip me better be ready to kill me first.

After that, I was never whipped again, even though I stayed a slave for four more years.

I fought a few more times, but was never whipped.

For a long time, I wondered why Mr. Covey didn’t have me taken to the whipping post and punished for hitting a white man to defend myself. The only answer I can think of doesn’t fully make sense, but I’ll share it anyway. Mr. Covey was known for being a great overseer who could control slaves well. His reputation was very important to him. If he had sent me—a boy about sixteen years old—to be whipped in public, he would have lost that reputation. So, to protect his name, he let me go without punishment.
