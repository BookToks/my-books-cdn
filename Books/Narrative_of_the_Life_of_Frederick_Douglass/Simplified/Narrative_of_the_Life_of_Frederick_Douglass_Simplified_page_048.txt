He gave me the best reason to trust completely that learning to read would bring me good results. What he was most afraid of was exactly what I wanted the most. What he loved the most, I hated the most. What he saw as a big bad thing to avoid, I saw as a great good to work hard for. The reasons he gave to stop me from learning to read only made me want to learn even more. When I learned to read, I owed almost as much to my master’s strong opposition as to the kind help from my mistress. I appreciate what both of them did for me.

I hadn’t been in Baltimore long before I noticed a big difference in how slaves were treated compared to the country. A city slave was almost like a free person compared to a slave on a plantation. City slaves got better food and clothes and had privileges that plantation slaves didn’t. There was some sense of decency and shame that stopped the terrible cruelty often seen on plantations. A slave owner who hurt his slaves badly would shock his neighbors who didn’t own slaves. Most didn’t want to be known as cruel masters, and especially didn’t want to be known for not feeding their slaves enough.

Every city slave owner wanted people to know they fed their slaves well, and most of them did give enough food. But there were some sad exceptions. Right across the street from us on Philpot Street lived Mr. Thomas Hamilton. He owned two slaves named Henrietta and Mary. Henrietta was about twenty-two, and Mary was about fourteen. Of all the injured and thin people I ever saw, these two were the worst. His heart must be harder than stone if he could look at them without feeling anything.
