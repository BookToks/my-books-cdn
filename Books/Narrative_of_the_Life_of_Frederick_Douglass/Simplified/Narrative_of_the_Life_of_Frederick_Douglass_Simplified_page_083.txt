Without these, the slave would be pushed to the worst kind of desperation; and bad luck for the slaveholder if he tries to stop or mess with these things! I warn him that if he does, a force will rise among the slaves, scarier than the strongest earthquake.

Holidays are a big part of the lies, cruelty, and unfairness of slavery. Slaveholders say holidays are a kind gift, but I say they are selfish and one of the worst tricks played on slaves. They don’t give holidays because they want to be nice, but because they know it would be dangerous to keep working the slaves all the time.

You can see this because slaveholders want slaves to spend holidays in a way that makes them glad when the break is over. Their goal is to make slaves hate freedom by pushing them into bad habits. For example, slaveholders don’t just let slaves drink—they make plans to get them drunk. One way is by betting on who can drink the most whiskey without getting drunk, which leads many slaves to drink too much.

So, when a slave asks for true freedom, the tricky slaveholder fools him with a fake kind of freedom, filled with bad behavior and called liberty. Most of us used to fall for it, and the result was expected: many thought there wasn’t much difference between being free or still a slave. We felt we might as well be slaves to rum as to a human master.

When the holidays ended, we got up from our mess, took a deep breath, and went back to the fields—feeling, on the whole, kind of glad to leave what our master tricked us into believing was freedom, and return to slavery.
