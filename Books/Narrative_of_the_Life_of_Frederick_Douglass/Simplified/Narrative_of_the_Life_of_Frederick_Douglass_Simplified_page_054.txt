I saw it in every star, felt it in every calm, breathed it in every wind, and saw it move in every storm.

I often felt really bad about myself and wished I was dead. If I didn’t hope for freedom, I might have ended my life or done something that would get me killed. While I felt this way, I wanted to hear anyone talk about slavery. I listened whenever I could. Sometimes, I heard people talk about abolitionists. It took me a while to learn what that word meant. It was always said in a way that made me interested.

If a slave ran away and got away safely, or if a slave did something bad like killing their master or burning a barn, slave owners said it was because of abolition. I heard the word a lot and decided to find out what it meant. The dictionary didn’t help much. It said abolition meant “the act of abolishing,” but I didn’t know what was being abolished. I was confused. I didn’t ask anyone because I thought they didn’t want me to know.

After waiting patiently, I got a city paper that talked about petitions from the North asking to end slavery in Washington D.C. and to stop the slave trade between states. Then I understood what abolition and abolitionist meant. I always tried to listen when I heard the word, hoping it was something important for me and other slaves.

Slowly, I began to understand more. One day, I went down to Mr. Waters’ wharf. I saw two Irishmen unloading stones, so I helped them without being asked. When we finished, one asked me if I was a slave. I told him yes. He then asked, “Are you a slave for life?”
