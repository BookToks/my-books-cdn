My time working for Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas Day, 1833. The days between Christmas and New Year’s Day were holidays, so we didn’t have to do much work except feed and take care of the animals. We thought of this time as our own, given to us by our masters, so we used it however we wanted. Those of us with families far away were usually allowed to spend all six days with them.

During this time, people did different things. The serious and hardworking ones made things like corn brooms, mats, horse collars, and baskets. Others spent the time hunting opossums, hares, and raccoons. But most of us played games like ball, wrestling, running races, and also fiddled, danced, and drank whiskey. Our masters liked it best when we spent the holidays this way. A slave who worked during the holidays was seen as not deserving the time off. It was shameful not to get drunk at Christmas, and anyone who didn’t save enough whiskey during the year to last through Christmas was called lazy.

From what I’ve seen, these holidays are one of the best ways slaveholders keep slaves from rebelling. If the masters stopped giving these breaks, I’m sure the slaves would rebel right away. These holidays act like safety valves, letting slaves release some of their anger and frustration without causing trouble.
