When I escaped from slavery, I had one rule: “Trust no one!” I saw every white person as an enemy, and I didn’t trust many Black people either. This was really hard to deal with. To understand, you have to imagine being in my place.

Imagine you are a runaway slave in a strange land where slaveholders hunt people like animals. The people there are allowed to kidnap you. You could be caught any second, just like a crocodile grabbing its prey! Imagine having no home, no friends, no money, and no one to help you. You’re hungry but can’t buy food. You are being chased by cruel men, don’t know where to go, and can’t protect yourself or escape. You’re surrounded by houses but have no home. You’re around people but feel like you’re surrounded by wild animals ready to hurt you. If someone could be in this situation, like I was, they would understand how hard it was and feel sorry for a runaway slave who has been hurt and worked so hard.

Thank God, I wasn’t stuck in this terrible place for long. A kind man named Mr. DAVID RUGGLES helped me. He was careful, kind, and never gave up on me. I will always remember and be thankful for what he did.

Now, Mr. Ruggles is blind and needs help like the help he once gave to others.
