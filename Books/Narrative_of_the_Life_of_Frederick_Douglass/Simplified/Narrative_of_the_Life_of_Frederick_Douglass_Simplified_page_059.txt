After he did this terrible thing to my brother, he looked at me and said he planned to treat me the same way someday—probably when I became his property.

Luckily, I was given to Mrs. Lucretia and sent back to Baltimore to live with Master Hugh’s family again. They were just as happy to see me come back as they were sad when I left. It was a good day for me because I had escaped a really dangerous situation. I was away from Baltimore for about a month, but it felt like six.

Soon after I got back, my mistress Lucretia died, leaving behind her husband and one child named Amanda. Not long after, Master Andrew died too. Now, everything my old master owned, including slaves, was controlled by strangers—people who didn’t help build that wealth. None of the slaves were freed. Every single one stayed a slave, from the youngest to the oldest.

One thing that made me hate slavery even more was how ungrateful the slave owners were to my grandmother. She had worked for my old master her whole life. She helped him build his wealth and filled his plantation with slaves. She had even become a great-grandmother while serving him. She cared for him as a baby, helped him as a child, served him all his life, and at his death, she wiped the sweat from his cold forehead and closed his eyes. But even after all this, she was still a slave—a slave for life—now owned by strangers. They also controlled her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, breaking up our family like sheep, without giving us any say about what would happen to us.
