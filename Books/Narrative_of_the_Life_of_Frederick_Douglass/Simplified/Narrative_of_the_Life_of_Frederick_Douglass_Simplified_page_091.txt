We only knew about the North as far as New York. Going there meant always worrying about being caught and sent back to slavery, where life would be even worse than before. This was a scary thought and hard to get past.

Every place we passed had guards watching us—at gates, ferries, bridges, and even in the woods. We were surrounded everywhere. These were the real or imagined dangers we faced, with good and bad all mixed together.

On one side was slavery, a harsh and terrible reality stained with the blood of millions. It was still hurting us badly. On the other side, far away in the North, there was a kind of freedom waiting for us, but it was uncertain and cold, calling us to come and be free. 

This idea was sometimes too much to believe. When we looked at the journey ahead, we got scared. Death seemed to be everywhere. Sometimes we faced starvation, sometimes drowning in rivers, or being caught and torn apart by hunting dogs. We were stung, chased by wild animals, bitten by snakes, and after all that, even if we got close to freedom, we could be caught and shot.

This scary picture sometimes made us want to stay with what we knew, even if it was bad, rather than risk unknown dangers. When we finally decided to run away, it was a stronger choice than Patrick Henry’s famous “liberty or death” decision.
