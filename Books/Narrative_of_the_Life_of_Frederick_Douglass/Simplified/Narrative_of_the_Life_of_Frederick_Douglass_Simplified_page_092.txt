For us, freedom was risky and could easily mean death if we failed. Personally, I would rather die than live a life with no hope.

Sandy, one of our group, gave up on the idea but still cheered us on. Our group included Henry Harris, John Harris, Henry Bailey, Charles Roberts, and me. Henry Bailey was my uncle and belonged to my master. Charles married my aunt and belonged to my master’s father-in-law, Mr. William Hamilton.

Our plan was to take a big canoe that belonged to Mr. Hamilton. On the Saturday night before the Easter holidays, we would paddle straight up Chesapeake Bay. When we got to the far end of the bay, about seventy or eighty miles from where we lived, we planned to let the canoe float away and then follow the North Star until we left Maryland.

We chose to travel by water because people might think we were fishermen, so we would get less attention. If we traveled on land, people with white skin could stop us anytime and check who we were.

A week before we left, I wrote letters for each of us. They said something like this: “This is to say that I, the person signing below, have given my servant permission to go to Baltimore and spend the Easter holidays. Written by my own hand, 1835. William Hamilton, Near St. Michael’s, in Talbot County, Maryland.” 

We weren’t really going to Baltimore, but since we were going up the bay toward Baltimore, these letters were meant to protect us while we were on the water.
