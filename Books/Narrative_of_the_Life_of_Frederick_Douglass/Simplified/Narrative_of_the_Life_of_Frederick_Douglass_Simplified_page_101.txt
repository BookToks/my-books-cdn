I managed to get away without getting hit again, but just barely. Because if you hit a white man, you could be killed by Lynch law—that was the rule in Mr. Gardner’s shipyard, and it wasn’t much different anywhere else.

I went straight home and told Master Hugh what had happened to me. Even though he wasn’t religious, he acted much better than his brother Thomas would have in the same situation. He listened carefully to my story about the attack and showed he was very angry about it.

My old kind mistress felt sorry for me again. Seeing my swollen eye and bloody face made her cry. She sat next to me, washed the blood off my face, and treated my head with care like a mother would. She even put a piece of fresh beef over my hurt eye. It almost made up for what I went through to see her being kind again.

Master Hugh was really mad. He cursed the people who hurt me. When I started feeling a little better, he took me to Esquire Watson on Bond Street to see what could be done. Mr. Watson asked who saw the attack. Master Hugh said it happened in Mr. Gardner’s shipyard at noon, where lots of men were working.

Mr. Watson said the attack definitely happened and they knew who did it. But he said he couldn’t do anything unless a white man came forward to say what he saw. He couldn’t get a warrant just from my word. Even if a thousand Black people had seen me killed, their combined testimony wouldn’t be enough to arrest the attackers. Master Hugh had to admit that this situation was really unfair.
