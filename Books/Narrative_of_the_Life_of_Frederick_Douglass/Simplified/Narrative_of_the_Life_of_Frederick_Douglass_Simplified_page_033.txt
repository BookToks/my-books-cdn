Colonel Lloyd had three sons—Edward, Murray, and Daniel—and three sons-in-law, Mr. Winder, Mr. Nicholson, and Mr. Lowndes. They all lived at the Great House Farm and liked to whip the servants whenever they wanted. This included everyone, from old Barney to William Wilkes, the coach driver. I saw Winder make a servant stand far enough away so he could reach him with the tip of his whip, and every time he hit, it left big marks on the man’s back.

Colonel Lloyd was super rich—almost like the richest man in the Bible, Job. He kept between ten and fifteen servants in the house. People said he owned about a thousand slaves, and I think that’s true. He had so many slaves that he didn’t even know them all when he saw them. Many slaves from the smaller farms didn’t even know who he was.

One time, while riding down the road, he met a black man and asked him like people usually did in the South, “Well, boy, who do you belong to?” The man said, “To Colonel Lloyd.” 

“Does the colonel treat you well?” Lloyd asked. 

“No, sir,” the man replied. 

“Does he make you work too hard?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Does he give you enough to eat?” 

“Yes, sir, he gives me enough, such as it is.” 

After finding out where the slave lived, the colonel rode away. The man kept going, not knowing he just talked to his own master. He didn’t think about it again until two or three weeks later. Then his overseer told him that because he had spoken badly about his master, he would be sold to a trader in Georgia. The man was chained and handcuffed right away and taken away without warning. He was separated from his family and friends forever, by a punishment worse than death. This is what happens when you tell the simple truth in answer to plain questions.
