I met many people who had been free for less than seven years, living in nicer houses and enjoying better lives than most slave owners in Maryland. I can honestly say that my friend Mr. Nathan Johnson (who helped me when I was hungry and thirsty and welcomed me when I was a stranger) lived in a cleaner house, ate better food, read and paid for more newspapers, and understood the country’s moral, religious, and political issues better than most slave owners in Talbot County, Maryland.

Mr. Johnson was a hard worker. Both he and his wife had hands made tough from work. I found the Black people there to be much braver than I expected. They were determined to protect each other from dangerous kidnappers, no matter what. Soon after I arrived, I heard a story that showed their courage. A Black man and a runaway slave didn’t get along. The first man threatened to tell the runaway’s master where he was hiding.

Right away, the Black community called a meeting with a notice saying, “Business of importance!” The man who threatened was asked to come. When everyone arrived, they chose a very religious old man to lead the meeting. He probably said a prayer, then spoke: “Friends, we have him here, and I think you young men should just take him outside and kill him!” Some of them rushed at the man, but others stopped them, and the man got away. He hasn’t been seen in New Bedford since.

I believe there haven’t been any more threats like that. If there are, I’m sure the punishment will be very serious.
