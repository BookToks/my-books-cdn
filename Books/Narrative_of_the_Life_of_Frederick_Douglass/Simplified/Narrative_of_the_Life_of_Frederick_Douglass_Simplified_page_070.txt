The next day, I went with my team back to the place where I had been chopping wood the day before. I loaded my cart with a lot of wood, hoping this would help control my oxen. Then I started heading home. Half of the day had already passed. 

I got out of the woods safely and thought I was out of danger. I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate. But before I could grab the ox-rope, the oxen suddenly ran through the gate. They caught the gate between the wheel and the cart, tearing it apart. They almost crushed me against the gate-post. 

So, twice in one day, I barely escaped death by a very small chance. When I got back, I told Mr. Covey what had happened. He told me to go back to the woods right away. I did, and he followed me. 

Just as I got into the woods, he caught up and told me to stop the cart. He said he would teach me how to waste time and break gates. Then he went to a big gum tree, cut three big switches with his axe, and trimmed them with his pocket-knife. He told me to take off my clothes. 

I didn’t answer and just stood there with my clothes on. He told me again. I still didn’t move or say anything. Then he rushed at me like a wild animal, tore off my clothes, and whipped me until his switches were worn out. He cut me badly, leaving marks that stayed for a long time. 

This was the first of many whippings like this, all for similar reasons.

I lived with Mr. Covey for one year. In the first six months, almost every week he whipped me. My back was almost always sore. He used my clumsiness as an excuse to whip me. We worked very hard, almost more than we could handle. 

We woke up long before sunrise, fed the horses, and by the first light we were out in the fields with hoes and plowing teams.
