The little kids I knew lived on Philpot Street, very close to Durgin and Bailey’s shipyard. I used to talk about slavery with them. Sometimes I told them I wished I could be as free as they would be when they grew up. “You will be free when you turn twenty-one, but I am a slave forever! Don’t I have the same right to be free as you?” These words made them sad. They felt sorry for me and hoped that one day something would happen so I could be free.

I was about twelve years old then, and the idea of being a slave forever made me very sad. Around that time, I found a book called “The Columbian Orator.” I read it whenever I could. In the book, there was a conversation between a master and his slave. The slave had run away three times. When he was caught the third time, they talked. The master tried to argue why slavery was right, but the slave answered back with very smart and powerful words. In the end, the master decided to free the slave.

In the same book, I also found a strong speech by Sheridan about Catholic emancipation. These were important words to me. I read them again and again because they expressed the feelings I had inside, feelings I had thought about but never said out loud.
