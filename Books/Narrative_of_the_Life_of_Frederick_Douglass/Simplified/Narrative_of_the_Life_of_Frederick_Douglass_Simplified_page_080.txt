Mr. Covey thought he had me under control and could do whatever he wanted. But suddenly—I don’t know where the courage came from—I decided to fight back. I grabbed Covey hard by the throat and stood up. He held on to me, and I held on to him. My fight surprised him so much that he shook like a leaf. This gave me confidence, and I held him tight, making him bleed a little where I touched him.

Covey soon called Hughes for help. Hughes came and tried to tie my right hand while Covey held me. When Hughes was doing that, I kicked him hard near his ribs.

The kick made Hughes sick, so he stopped helping Covey. This kick also made Covey weaker. When he saw Hughes hurt, Covey lost some courage. He asked me if I was going to keep fighting. I told him yes, no matter what. I said he had treated me badly for six months, and I wasn’t going to let him do it anymore.

Then, Covey tried to grab a stick lying just outside the stable to hit me. But as he bent down, I grabbed him by the collar with both hands and pulled him down to the ground. By this time, Bill came over. Covey asked Bill to help, but Bill said, “My master hired me to work, not to help whip you,” and left us to fight alone.

We fought for almost two hours. Finally, Covey let me go, breathing hard and saying that if I hadn’t fought back, he wouldn’t have whipped me so much. But really, he hadn’t whipped me at all. I thought he lost the fight because I didn’t get hurt, but he did. The whole six months after that, I stayed with Mr.
