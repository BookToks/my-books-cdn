We had only been in jail for about twenty minutes when a bunch of slave traders and their helpers came in to look at us and see if we were for sale. I had never seen people like them before! I felt like I was surrounded by pure evil. They looked like pirates, and I thought they must be the devil’s children. They laughed and smiled at us, saying, "Ah, my boys! We got you, didn’t we?" After teasing us, they started checking us one by one to see how much we were worth. They even had the nerve to ask if we wanted them to be our masters. We didn’t answer and just let them figure it out. Then they cursed at us, saying they could break our spirits quickly if we were in their hands.

While we were in jail, we found the place was better than we expected. We didn’t get much food, and it wasn’t very good, but our room was clean. From the windows, we could see what was happening outside, which was a lot better than being in a dark, damp cell.

Overall, the jail and the jailer treated us okay. Right after the holidays, which was a surprise, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland came to Easton and took Charles, the two Henrys, and John out of jail and brought them home, leaving me alone.

I thought this was the final separation. It hurt me more than anything else in the whole situation. I was ready for anything except being separated. I guessed they had talked and decided that since I was the main reason the others wanted to run away, it was unfair for the innocent ones to suffer with me. So, they took the others home and planned to sell me as a warning to the rest. I have to say, the noble Henry seemed just as sad about leaving the prison as he was about leaving home.
