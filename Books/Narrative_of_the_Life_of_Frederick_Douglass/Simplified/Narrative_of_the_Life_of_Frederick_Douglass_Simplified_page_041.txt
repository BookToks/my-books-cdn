When I lived on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, I was treated pretty much like the other slave kids.

I was too young to work in the fields, and since there wasn’t much else to do, I had a lot of free time. The main things I had to do were to bring the cows home in the evening, keep the chickens out of the garden, clean the front yard, and run errands for my old master’s daughter, Mrs. Lucretia Auld. Most of my free time was spent helping Master Daniel Lloyd find birds after he shot them. I got along well with Master Daniel, and that helped me. He liked me and protected me. He wouldn’t let the older boys bother me, and he even shared his cakes with me.

I wasn’t often whipped by my old master, but I suffered a lot from hunger and cold. I was more cold than hungry. In the hottest summers and coldest winters, I was almost naked—no shoes, no socks, no jacket, no pants, just a rough linen shirt that only reached my knees. I didn’t have a bed either. On the coldest nights, I would sneak into a corn bag used for carrying corn to the mill. I’d crawl inside and sleep on the cold, damp clay floor with my head inside the bag and my feet sticking out. My feet got so cracked from the frost that you could put the pen I’m writing with into the cuts.

We didn’t get regular meals. Our food was coarse cornmeal boiled into something called mush. It was put in a big wooden tray on the ground. The children were called like pigs, and like pigs, we would rush to eat the mush. Some used oyster shells, others used pieces of wood, some used their bare hands, and none of us had spoons.
