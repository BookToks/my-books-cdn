When the horn sounds, everyone has to get up and go straight to the field. No one is allowed to stop; everyone must be at their place. If someone doesn’t hear the horn, they will still be woken up by feeling it. It doesn’t matter how old or what gender they are—no one is excused.  

Mr. Severe, the overseer, used to stand by the door of the living area with a big stick and a heavy whip. He was ready to punish anyone who didn’t hear or wasn’t ready to go to the field when the horn blew.  

Mr. Severe was named well because he was very cruel. I saw him whip a woman so badly that she bled for half an hour. This happened while her children cried and begged him to stop. He seemed to enjoy being so cruel. Besides being mean, he also swore a lot. Hearing him talk scared anyone because almost every sentence had a terrible curse.  

The field was the place where he showed his cruelty and swore the most. He made the field a place of pain and bad language. From morning till night, he was yelling, hitting, and hurting the slaves in the field in a terrible way.  

He didn’t last long. He died soon after I arrived at Colonel Lloyd’s. Even as he was dying, he kept shouting curses and horrible words.
