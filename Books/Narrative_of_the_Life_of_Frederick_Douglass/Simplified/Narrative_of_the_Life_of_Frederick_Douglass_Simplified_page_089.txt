They came because they wanted to learn. Their minds had been starved by their cruel masters. They had been kept in mental darkness. I taught them because it made me happy to do something that seemed to help my people. I kept my school going almost the whole year I lived with Mr. Freeland. Besides my Sabbath school, I spent three evenings a week during the winter teaching the slaves at home. I’m glad to say that several who came to Sabbath school learned how to read, and at least one of them is now free because of me.

The year went by smoothly. It felt like it was only half as long as the year before. I didn’t get hit even once. I will say that Mr. Freeland was the best master I ever had until I became my own master.

Part of the reason the year went okay was because of my fellow slaves. They were amazing people; not only kind but also brave. We were connected to each other in many ways. I loved them more than I have ever loved anyone since. Some people say slaves don’t love or trust each other, but that’s not true. I never loved or trusted anyone more than my fellow slaves, especially those at Mr. Freeland’s. I believe we would have died for each other. We never did anything important without talking it over together. We never acted alone. We were like one, joined not just by what we felt but also by the hard life we all had as slaves.

At the end of 1834, Mr. Freeland hired me again from my master for the year 1835. But by then, I wanted to live on free land and not just stay with Freeland. I was no longer okay living with him or any other slaveholder.
