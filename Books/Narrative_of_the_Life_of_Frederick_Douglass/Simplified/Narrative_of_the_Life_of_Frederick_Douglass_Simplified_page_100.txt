They felt they had to stop it right away. Using Mr. Gardner’s problems, they quit working and said they wouldn’t work anymore unless he fired his black carpenters.

Even though this wasn’t officially about me, it affected me. My fellow apprentices soon felt it was beneath them to work with me. They started acting stuck-up and saying mean things about “niggers” taking over the country, saying we should all be killed. Encouraged by the older workers, they made my life really hard by bossing me around and sometimes hitting me. 

I kept the promise I made after fighting Mr. Covey and fought back no matter what. I was able to beat each one when they came at me alone. But eventually, they teamed up and attacked me with sticks, stones, and heavy tools. One had a half brick in front, two were on my sides, and one was behind me. While I was fighting those in front and on the sides, the one behind hit me hard on the head with a tool. It stunned me, and I fell down.

They all jumped on me and started punching me. I let them hit me for a while to get ready. Then suddenly, I pushed myself up on my hands and knees. Just then, one kicked me hard in my left eye with a heavy boot. It felt like my eyeball burst. When they saw my eye was closed and swollen, they stopped and left me. 

I grabbed the tool and chased them for a bit, but the carpenters stopped me. I realized I couldn’t fight so many people at once. This all happened in front of at least fifty white ship carpenters, and none of them said a kind word. Some even yelled, “Kill the damned nigger! Kill him! He hit a white man.” I knew the only way to survive was to run away.
