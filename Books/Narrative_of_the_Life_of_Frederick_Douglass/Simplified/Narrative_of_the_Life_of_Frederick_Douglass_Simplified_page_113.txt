After getting this certificate and a five-dollar bill from Mr. Ruggles, I carried some of our bags, and Anna took the rest. We quickly set off to catch the steamboat John W. Richmond going to Newport, on our way to New Bedford. Mr. Ruggles gave me a letter for a man named Mr. Shaw in Newport and told me if I ran out of money before reaching New Bedford, I should stop in Newport and ask for help.

When we got to Newport, we really wanted to get somewhere safe. Even though we didn’t have enough money to pay for the next part of the trip, we decided to get seats on the stagecoach and promised to pay once we reached New Bedford. Two kind men from New Bedford, Joseph Ricketson and William C. Taber, encouraged us to do this. They understood our situation right away and made us feel safe and comfortable. It was really nice to meet friends like them at such a tough time.

When we arrived in New Bedford, they told us to go to Mr. Nathan Johnson’s house. He and his wife welcomed us warmly and took great care of us. They really cared about helping people like us and were true abolitionists.

The stagecoach driver didn’t let us leave because we couldn’t pay the fare, so he held on to our bags until we paid him back. I told Mr. Johnson about this, and he quickly gave the money to pay the driver.

Now we started to feel safer and began getting ready for the challenges and responsibilities that come with living as free people.

The morning after we got to New Bedford, while we were having breakfast, we talked about what name I should use. My mom had named me “Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey,” but I had stopped using the two middle names before I left Maryland. Most people just called me “Frederick Bailey.”
