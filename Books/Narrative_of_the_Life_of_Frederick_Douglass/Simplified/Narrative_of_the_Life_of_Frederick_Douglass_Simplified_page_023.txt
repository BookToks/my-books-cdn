My master was not a kind slave owner. It took a very cruel overseer to even shock him. He was a mean man, used to owning slaves for a long time. Sometimes, he seemed to enjoy whipping a slave.

I was often woken up early in the morning by the terrible screams of my own aunt. He would tie her up and whip her back until she was covered in blood. No words, tears, or prayers from her could stop him. The more she screamed, the harder he whipped her. Where the blood flowed most, he whipped the longest. He whipped her both to make her scream and to make her quiet. He only stopped when he got too tired to continue.

I remember the first time I ever saw this awful scene. I was just a child, but I will never forget it. It was the first of many terrible things I had to watch and be part of. It felt like I was stepping into the worst part of slavery. It was a horrible sight, and I wish I could explain how I felt when I saw it.

This happened soon after I started living with my old master, and it happened because of what my aunt did.

One night, Aunt Hester went out, but I don’t know where or why. She wasn’t home when my master wanted to see her. He had told her not to go out at night and warned her never to be with a young man who liked her. This young man belonged to Colonel Lloyd and was called Ned Roberts, or Lloyd’s Ned. Why my master was so careful about her is something people can only guess. She was a beautiful woman, with a strong, graceful body, and was one of the most attractive women, black or white, in our area.
