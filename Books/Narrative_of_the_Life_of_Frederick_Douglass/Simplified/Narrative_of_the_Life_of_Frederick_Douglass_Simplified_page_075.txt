The steamboats were heading northeast from North Point. I will do the same. When I reach the end of the bay, I will leave my canoe and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania. There, I won’t need a pass and can travel without being bothered. As soon as I get the chance, no matter what happens, I’m leaving.

Meanwhile, I will try to handle this hard life. I’m not the only slave out there. Why should I be so upset? I can handle as much as anyone else. Also, I’m just a boy, and all boys have to answer to someone. Maybe my suffering now will make me appreciate freedom even more later. A better day is coming. That’s what I used to tell myself; sometimes I felt crazy with anger, but other times I tried to accept my sad situation.

I already said my time with Mr. Covey was worse in the first six months than the last six. What changed with Mr. Covey was a big moment in my life. You’ve seen how a man becomes a slave; now you’ll see how a slave becomes a man. One hot day in August 1833, Bill Smith, William Hughes, a slave named Eli, and I were working fanning wheat. Hughes was clearing the wheat, Eli was turning it, Smith was feeding the fan, and I was carrying wheat to the fan.

The work was simple and needed strength, not brains. But for someone who had never done it before, it was very hard.

Around three o’clock that day, I got really weak. My head hurt, I felt dizzy, and my whole body shook. I knew I was about to collapse, but I pushed myself to keep working. I stood as long as I could, carrying grain to the fan. When I couldn’t stand any longer, I fell down and felt like a huge weight was holding me down.
