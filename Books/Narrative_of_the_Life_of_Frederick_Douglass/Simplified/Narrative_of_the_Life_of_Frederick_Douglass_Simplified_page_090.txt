At the start of the year, I got ready for a final fight that would decide what would happen to me. I wanted to rise up. I was almost a man, and year after year had passed, but I was still a slave. These thoughts woke me up—I had to do something. So, I decided that 1835 would not pass without me trying to get my freedom.

But I didn’t want to keep this hope to myself. My fellow slaves were important to me. I wanted them to join me in this life-saving plan. So, carefully, I started early to find out what they thought and felt about being slaves, and I tried to fill their minds with ideas of freedom. I worked hard to find ways for us to escape, and I used every chance to show them how unfair and cruel slavery was. I talked first to Henry, then to John, and then to the others. I found that they all had kind hearts and strong spirits. They were ready to listen and ready to act when a good plan came up. That was exactly what I wanted. I told them we weren’t real men if we accepted being slaves without at least trying one brave time to be free.

We met a lot and talked often, sharing our hopes and fears. We talked about the hard problems we would face, both real and imagined. Sometimes, we almost gave up and thought about just accepting our sad life. Other times, we were strong and sure we had to go. Whenever we thought of a plan, we got scared—the chances were terrible. Our way was full of huge dangers; and even if we made it to the end, our right to be free was still not certain—we could be caught and sent back to slavery. We couldn’t find any place, on this side of the ocean, where we would be truly free. We didn’t even know about Canada.
