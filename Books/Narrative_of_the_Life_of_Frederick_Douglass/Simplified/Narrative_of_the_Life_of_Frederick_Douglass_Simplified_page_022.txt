Every year, many new slaves are born.

One important leader from the South guessed that slavery would end because the population would change. Whether or not this happens, it’s clear that the slaves in the South now look very different from the ones first brought from Africa. If nothing else, this change proves that the idea that God cursed Ham and that’s why American slavery is right is wrong. If only Ham’s descendants were supposed to be slaves, then slavery in the South will soon stop being “scriptural” because many slaves are born from white fathers—often their own masters—just like me.

I had two masters. My first master’s last name was Anthony. I don’t remember his first name. People usually called him Captain Anthony, probably because he sailed a boat on Chesapeake Bay. He wasn’t a very rich slaveowner. He had two or three farms and about thirty slaves. An overseer took care of the farms and slaves. His name was Plummer.

Mr. Plummer was a terrible drunk who swore a lot and was very cruel. He always carried a cowskin whip and a heavy stick. I have seen him cut and hurt women so badly that even the master got angry and said he would punish Plummer if he didn’t behave.
