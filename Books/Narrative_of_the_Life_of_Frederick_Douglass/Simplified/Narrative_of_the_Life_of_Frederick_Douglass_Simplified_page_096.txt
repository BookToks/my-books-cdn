But just as he was about to carry out his plan, he was needed to help tie up Henry. The fight that broke out made them forget, or maybe think it was too risky, to search us. So we weren’t caught trying to run away yet.

When we were about halfway to St. Michael’s, the officers who had us were looking ahead, and Henry asked me what he should do with his pass. I told him to eat it with his biscuit and say nothing. Then we all agreed to “Own nothing.” We trusted each other completely. We decided to stick together no matter what happened. We were ready for anything. That morning, we were going to be dragged fifteen miles behind horses and then put in the Easton jail. When we got to St. Michael’s, they questioned us. We all said we never planned to run away. We did this more to hear the proof against us than to try to get free, because, like I said, we were ready for whatever. Honestly, we didn’t care where we ended up, as long as we stayed together.

Our biggest fear was being separated. We were more scared of that than almost anything except death. The only proof against us came from one person. Our master wouldn’t say who it was, but we all guessed who the snitch was. Then they sent us to Easton jail. When we got there, the sheriff, Mr. Joseph Graham, took us and locked us up.

Henry, John, and I were put in one room, and Charles and Henry Bailey in another. They separated us to stop us from planning together.
