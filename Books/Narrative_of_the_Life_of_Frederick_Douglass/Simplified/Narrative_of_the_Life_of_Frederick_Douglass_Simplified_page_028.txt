The slaves saw his death as a kind and lucky event.  

Mr. Severe was replaced by Mr. Hopkins, who was very different. He was less mean, swore less, and was quieter than Mr. Severe. He didn’t show extreme cruelty. He still whipped slaves but didn’t seem to enjoy it. The slaves called him a good overseer.  

Colonel Lloyd’s main plantation looked like a small village. All the work for the farms happened there. The slaves did shoemaking, fixing shoes, blacksmithing, building carts, making barrels, weaving, and grinding grain. The whole place looked busy and organized, different from the nearby farms.  

There were many houses, which made it better than the other farms. The slaves called it the Great House Farm. Slaves from other farms thought it was a big honor to be picked to run errands there. To them, it was like being chosen for something very important, like being elected to Congress.  

They believed it showed their overseers trusted them a lot. They wanted this job because it meant they didn’t have to work in the fields under the harsh driver. It was a special privilege worth working hard for.  

The smartest and most trusted slave got this honor the most. Those who wanted the job tried hard to please their overseers, just like politicians try to please and trick voters. The same kinds of behavior were seen in Colonel Lloyd’s slaves as in the slaves of political parties.
