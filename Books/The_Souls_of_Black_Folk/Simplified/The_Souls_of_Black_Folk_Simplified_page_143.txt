They might steal a watermelon, but they’ll give you back your lost purse without a scratch. The main problem with them as workers is that they don’t have a reason to work hard except that they like physical work. They don’t care much because they haven’t seen that being careful helps them; they don’t plan ahead because those who don’t plan seem to do just as well as those who do. Most of all, they don’t understand why they should work extra hard to improve the white man’s land, feed his mule, or save his corn.

On the other side, the white landowners think that trying to make these workers better by giving them more responsibility, higher pay, nicer homes, or land won’t work. They show visitors the damaged land, broken-down houses, worn-out soil, and farms with debts, and say, “This is what freedom means for Black people!”

Both sides have some points that make it hard for them to understand each other. Black people blame white people for their problems; if they are poor, it’s because white people take what they earn; if they are uneducated, it’s because white people don’t give them time or help to learn; and if something bad happens, they think white people are behind it. On the other hand, white landowners and their kids don’t get why Black people want more than just working for food and clothes. They don’t understand why they are unhappy and careless when their parents were quiet and loyal. One white merchant said to a Black customer, “Why, you Black folks have it easier than I do.” The customer answered, “Yes, and so do your pigs.”

Starting with the unhappy and lazy field worker, let’s look at how thousands of Black people in Dougherty have tried to improve their lives and what they want. Every social fight shows itself by the creation of different economic and social groups in a population that used to be the same. Today, among these Black people, there are clear economic groups.

There is a “submerged tenth” made up of croppers and a few poor people. Forty percent are metayers, and thirty-nine percent are semi-metayers and wage workers. Then there are five percent who rent land with money and six percent who own land—the “Upper Ten” of the landowners. The croppers have no money or food saved up even to get through planting to harvest time.
