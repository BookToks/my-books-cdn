Then they went on, fighting against cold and hunger, locked out of hotels, and often laughed at, always moving north. But the magic of their songs kept touching people’s hearts. Finally, a big cheer at the Congregational Council in Oberlin made the world notice them. They went to New York, and Henry Ward Beecher was brave enough to welcome them, even though big city newspapers mocked his “Nigger Minstrels.” Their songs won people over as they sang all across the country and even overseas, in front of queens and kings in Scotland, Ireland, Holland, and Switzerland. They sang for seven years and raised $150,000 to start Fisk University.

Since then, others have tried to copy them—sometimes well, like the singers from Hampton and Atlanta, and sometimes badly, like random small groups. Some people tried to make fun of the music and filled the air with bad versions that sound nothing like the real thing. But the true Negro folk-song still lives in the hearts of those who have heard it sung right and in the hearts of Black people.

What are these songs about, and what do they mean? I don’t know much about music and can’t explain it in technical words, but I know people. Knowing people, I understand that these songs are the clear message of slaves to the world. They say, in these busy days, that life was happy for Black slaves, carefree and joyful. I believe that was true for some, for many. But not everyone in the old South, even though it’s long gone, can deny the powerful story these songs tell. They are the music of a sad people, of kids who were let down; they talk about death and pain and quiet hope for a better world, about wandering without clear direction and secret paths.

These songs have been shaped over hundreds of years. The music is much older than the words, and you can see small changes over time. My great-great-grandmother was taken by a cruel Dutch trader two hundred years ago. She came to the valleys of the Hudson and Housatonic rivers, small and black and thin, shivering in the cold northern winds. She looked at the hills and often sang a old song to the child on her lap. The child sang it to his children, and they sang it to their children’s children. For two hundred years, it has been passed down to us, and we sing it to our children, not really knowing what the words mean, but feeling the deep meaning of the music.
