If history and logic give any clear answer to these questions, it is a strong No. Mr. Washington faces three big problems in his work: 

First, he is trying hard to help Black workers become business owners and property holders. But today, it’s impossible for workers and property owners to protect their rights and survive without the right to vote.

Second, he teaches saving money and self-respect, but also tells people to quietly accept being treated as less important citizens. This will slowly destroy the pride and strength of any race over time.

Third, he supports basic schooling and job training but looks down on higher education. Yet, Black schools and even Tuskegee can’t stay open without teachers trained in Black colleges or by their graduates.

These three problems in Mr. Washington’s ideas are criticized by two groups of Black Americans. 

One group comes from a history of fighting back, like leaders Toussaint, Gabriel, Vesey, and Turner. They want revenge and hate the white South, and many don’t trust white people at all. They think the only hope for Black people is to leave the United States. But, sadly, the way the U.S. has treated weaker and darker peoples in places like the West Indies, Hawaii, and the Philippines shows it’s hard to find a safe place anywhere.

The other group hasn’t spoken out much before. They don’t like seeing mixed messages or fighting among themselves. They especially don’t want to criticize a hardworking man like Mr. Washington just to let small-minded people spread hate. Still, the issues are so important that leaders like the Grimkes, Kelly Miller, and J. W. E. Bowen feel they can’t stay quiet much longer.

These leaders believe the nation must give Black people three things: the right to vote, equal treatment in public life, and education for young people based on their talents.
