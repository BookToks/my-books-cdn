Rows of old cabins look like they’re full of renters and workers. Most of them are sad, empty, and dirty, but sometimes the old, broken-down buildings look kind of interesting. A young black man greets us. He is twenty-two and just got married. Last year, he was lucky renting a place, but then cotton prices dropped and the sheriff took and sold everything he had. So he moved here, where rent is higher, the land is worse, and the owner is strict. He rents a mule that’s worth forty dollars for only twenty dollars a year. Poor guy! He’s like a slave at just twenty-two. This farm, now owned by a Russian Jew, used to be part of the famous Bolton estate. After the war, gangs of black convicts worked here for many years. Black convicts were even more common back then because it was a way to force black people to work, no matter if they were really guilty or not.

There are many stories about how badly the chained freedmen were treated, but the local leaders didn’t care until the free labor market almost collapsed because so many people left. Then, they stopped using convicts on the farms, but only after one of the best areas in the “Oakey Woods” was destroyed and turned into a useless, worn-out land. Now, only a Yankee or a Jew could make money from the poor tenants stuck in debt.

No wonder Luke Black, who is slow, sad, and tired, slowly walks up to our carriage and talks without hope. Why should he try? Every year he gets deeper in debt. It’s weird that Georgia, known as a safe place for poor debtors, treats its own people as badly as England did long ago! The poor land is struggling to grow, producing only about a hundred pounds of cotton per acre, where fifty years ago it made eight times more. From this small amount, the tenant pays a quarter to a third in rent, and most of the rest goes to pay interest on food and supplies bought on credit. For twenty years, an old black man with sunken cheeks worked under this system. Now, he’s just a day laborer, supporting his wife and himself on wages of a dollar and a half a week, and he only works part of the year.

The Bolton convict farm also included the farm next door. That’s where the convicts stayed in a big log prison that’s still there. It’s a sad place now, with rows of ugly huts full of unhappy and uneducated tenants. When I asked, “What rent do you pay here?” someone said, “I don’t know, what is it, Sam?” Sam answered, “All we make.” It’s a depressing place—bare, with no shade, and no charm from the past, only memories of forced hard work—before, during, and after the war.
