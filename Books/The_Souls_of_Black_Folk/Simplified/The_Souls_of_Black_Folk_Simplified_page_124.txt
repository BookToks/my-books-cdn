He owns almost a whole county in Rhode Island, with thousands of acres and hundreds of Black workers. Their homes look better than most, and the farm, with machines and fertilizers, is run more like a business than any other in the county, although the manager is tough when it comes to paying wages.

Now, if we look five miles above, near the edge of town, there are five houses where prostitutes live—two for Black women and three for white women. Two years ago, a bad Black boy was hiding openly in one of the white women’s houses and he was hanged for rape.

Nearby is the tall white fence of the “stockade,” which is the county prison. White people say it is always full of Black criminals, but Black people say only Black boys go to jail, not because they did something wrong, but because the State needs prisoners to work and make money.

The Jewish man is like the old slave owner in Dougherty. As we ride west through wide cornfields and small peach and pear orchards, we see a land that looks like the “Land of Canaan.” During the fast times after the Civil War, many business ideas like “improvement” companies, wine companies, mills, and factories started but mostly failed, and the Jewish man took control of them. Dougherty is a beautiful place west of the Flint River. The forests are amazing, filled with hickories, beeches, oaks, and palmettos instead of the tall pines. But the land is covered in debt. Merchants owe money to wholesalers, planters owe merchants, tenants owe planters, and workers struggle under all this debt.

Here and there, some people have managed to do better. We saw one fenced farm with grass and cows that felt like home after seeing so much corn and cotton. Some Black people own land: there’s Jackson, a quiet Black man with a hundred acres. He says, “Look up! If you don’t look up, you can’t get up,” and he has succeeded. Dark Carter has neat barns that would impress people in New England. His master helped him start, but when the Black man died last fall, the master’s sons immediately tried to take the land. “And those white folks will get it, too,” said my gossip.

I felt hopeful leaving these well-kept farms, thinking the Black people are rising. But even then, as we moved on, the fields started turning red and the trees disappeared.
