Leaving Black people without the right to vote today doesn’t help them. It doesn’t protect them from bad influences. Instead, it lets the worst people take advantage of them. This isn’t just true in the South, but also in the North and even in Europe. Anywhere there is free competition, if a group of weak and looked-down-on people—whether they are white, Black, or another color—are left under the control of stronger, richer people, those stronger people will often take advantage of them.

Also, the political situation of Black people in the South is connected to the issue of crime. Crime among Black people has gone up in the last thirty years. In big cities, there is now a clear group of criminals among Black communities. To understand this, we need to remember two things: first, that when slavery ended, crime naturally increased; and second, that the police system in the South was mainly created to control slaves, not free people.

About the first point, under slavery, there wasn’t really crime because slaves were controlled strictly. But when slaves were freed, they were suddenly left to live on their own. Some did well, some failed, and some got stuck in between, pushed around by the fast changes in society. The big social and economic change in the South after 1863 meant that some Black people who couldn’t manage or who were bad were removed from the group, and different social levels started to form. People who improved didn’t all change at once but grew slowly, like a plant with roots still in the soil. So, the appearance of Black criminals was something people should have expected. It is worrying, but it shouldn’t be a surprise.

The future depended on handling these criminals carefully and thoughtfully. At first, their crimes were mostly about being lazy, careless, or acting without thinking, not about being truly evil or out of control. These small crimes needed fair treatment that was strict but aimed at helping people change, without unfairness, and only punishing those definitely guilty. But the South didn’t have the right systems for this. There were no good jails or places to help criminals change. The police system was made to control Black people only, and it assumed every white man was automatically part of the police.
