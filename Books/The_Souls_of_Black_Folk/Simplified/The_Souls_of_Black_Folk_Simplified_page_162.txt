In a world where it means a lot to hold a man’s hand and sit next to him, to look honestly into his eyes and feel his heartbeat; in a world where sharing a cigar or a cup of tea means more than government meetings, magazine articles, or speeches—one can imagine what happens when there is almost no chance for this kind of friendship between races that are kept apart, even in parks and on streetcars.

Here, there is no chance for people to come down and connect with others, to open their hearts and hands from the best to the worst, recognizing that everyone is human and shares a future. But when it comes to simple charity, where there is no social contact, and helping the old and sick, the South is very generous. Black people asking for help are never turned away without getting more than just a little food, and requests for help get quick responses. I remember one cold winter in Atlanta when I didn’t give money to a public relief fund because I thought black people might be left out. Later, I asked a friend, “Were any black people helped?” He said, “They were all black.” But this isn’t the main problem. Moving forward as humans isn’t just about giving charity; it’s about sympathy and working together among groups who would normally reject charity.

In this place, in the higher levels of society where people strive for what is good and true, the color line separates natural friends and coworkers; but at the bottom, in places like bars, gambling spots, and brothels, this color line disappears.

I have tried to show a typical picture of the real relationship between the descendants of masters and servants in the South. I haven’t made things look better just for the sake of appearances because I think we’ve done that too much already. But I’ve also tried not to exaggerate unfairly. I believe that in some Southern communities things are better than I described, while in others they are much worse.
