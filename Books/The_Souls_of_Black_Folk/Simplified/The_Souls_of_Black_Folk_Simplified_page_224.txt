The Negro Academy should stand up and shout this out loud, just like Garrison did: *I will not back down, I will not give up any ground, and I will make sure people listen.* The Academy should bring together smart, kind men and pure, good-hearted women to fight against the bad forces that hurt our pride as men and women.

Today, there is no group of people on Earth stronger, smarter, or more moral than the American Negro, if they focus their energy the right way. They just have to break free from the limits put on them at birth, grab every chance they get, face challenges bravely, and fight against bad luck.

I have pointed out two areas for the Academy to work on: science and morals. Finally, I want to share the Academy's main beliefs:

1. We believe that Black people have something special to offer the world that no other group can.

2. We believe that Black Americans should keep their racial identity until their mission is complete and real brotherhood among all humans is possible.

3. We believe that if modern civilization works, it’s possible for Black and White people in America to live side by side in peace and happiness, each bringing their own unique culture to the country.

4. To achieve this, we don’t want total social equality that ignores what people naturally like or dislike, but a fair balance that respects culture, talent, and good character in everyone, no matter their skin color.

5. We believe that the first and most important step to fixing the problems between races is for Black people to work hard to fix the issues of bad behavior, crime, and laziness that still exist because of slavery. Only serious and long-lasting efforts by Black people can solve these problems.

6. We believe the next big step is to choose people fairly based on their skills and talents in work and education, and to respect personal freedom and worth, no matter their race.
