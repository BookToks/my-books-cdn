For six days a week, the town feels way too small for itself and seems to sleep a lot. But on Saturday, suddenly the whole county floods into the town. A huge crowd of black country people fills the streets, crowds the stores, blocks the sidewalks, clogs the roads, and completely takes over the town.

They are black, strong, rough country folks who are nice and simple. They talk a lot but are still quieter and more thoughtful than crowds in places like the Rhine-pfalz, Naples, or Cracow. They drink a good amount of whiskey but don’t get very drunk. Sometimes they laugh and talk loudly, but they hardly ever fight.

They walk up and down the streets, meet friends and gossip, look at store windows, buy coffee, cheap candy, and clothes. At sunset, they go home—not exactly happy, but definitely feeling better than if they hadn’t come.

So Albany is a real capital—a typical Southern county town, the center of life for ten thousand people. It’s their link to the outside world, their source of news and gossip, their place to buy and sell things, borrow and lend money, and where justice is served. Long ago, people knew country life well but not city life, so they thought of cities like crowded country areas. Now, most people forget what country life is like. You have to picture a small city of black people spread out over three hundred quiet square miles of land, with no trains or trolleys, surrounded by cotton fields, cornfields, patches of sand, and dark soil.

It gets really hot in Southern Georgia in July—a kind of steady, heavy heat that doesn’t seem to depend on the sun. It took us a few days to get brave enough to leave the porch and explore the long country roads to see this strange world. Finally, we started. It was about ten in the morning, bright with a light breeze, and we slowly drove south through the Flint valley. We passed the scattered box-shaped cabins of brick workers and a long row of houses jokingly called “The Ark.” Soon we were out in the open country, near the edges of big plantations from long ago. There was the “Joe Fields place”; he was a tough old man who had killed many black people in his time. His plantation stretched for twelve miles—a real kingdom.
