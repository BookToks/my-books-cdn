Sam Hose was a farm worker accused of killing his boss in Palmetto, Georgia, near Atlanta. A mob also said he raped the boss’s wife. Hose admitted to killing his boss after they argued about money but said he didn’t commit rape. In April 1899, a mob tortured and killed him in a public lynching watched by over 2,000 people. Du Bois, who was a professor at Atlanta University then, was very upset by this. When he went to deliver a letter protesting the lynching to a newspaper, he found out that Hose’s body had been burned and cut apart. His burnt fingers were even shown in a store window downtown.
