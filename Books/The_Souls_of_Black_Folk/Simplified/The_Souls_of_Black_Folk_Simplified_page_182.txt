This is the story of a black boy who, many years ago, started to fight with life so he could understand the world and himself. He faced three big challenges on those dark, sad hills in front of him: Hate, which appeared at the red dawn; Despair, which came at noon and made everything dark; and Doubt, which sneaks in with the evening. You also need to know about the hard times he went through, called the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

I first saw Alexander Crummell at a busy Wilberforce graduation event. He was tall, thin, and black, standing with simple dignity and a clear sense of good manners. I talked with him away from the loud young speakers so we could speak quietly. At first, I spoke politely, then with curiosity, and finally with excitement as I began to see how great his character was—his calm politeness, quiet strength, and honest hope for life. I naturally respected this man, like someone respects a wise prophet. He seemed like a wise person who didn’t come from the old past or the unknown future, but from the busy present—a world that felt both bright and dark, amazing and messy.
