The big, dark preacher moved back and forth as he spoke with powerful words that filled the air. People groaned and moved around, and then the thin brown woman next to me suddenly jumped up and screamed like she was lost. Around us, there were cries, wails, and loud sounds of strong feelings that I had never seen before.

If you have never seen a crazy Negro revival in the deep Southern woods, you can’t really understand the religious feelings of the slaves. When you read about it, it might seem strange or funny, but seeing it in person is shocking. This slave religion had three main parts: the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy. The Preacher was a special person the Negroes created in America. He was a leader, a speaker, a kind of boss, a planner, and a dreamer, all at once. He was always the center of a group that could be small or huge.

The Preacher was smart and serious, with skill and ability that made him stand out and stay important. This kind of preacher changed depending on where and when he lived — from the West Indies in the 1500s to New England in the 1800s, and from places like Mississippi to big cities like New Orleans or New York.

The Music in Negro religion was a sad, rhythmic tune with emotional sounds that, even though sometimes copied or changed, stayed the most original and beautiful way people expressed their feelings in America. It started in African forests, where similar music still exists, and was changed and made stronger by the painful lives of slaves. Under harsh laws and punishment, it became the true way to show a people’s sadness, pain, and hope.

The last part was the Frenzy, or “Shouting,” when the Spirit of the Lord took over someone and made them wild with joy. This part was the most deeply believed in. It could look like quiet, peaceful faces or soft sounds, but sometimes it was loud and wild — stamping feet, screaming, shouting, running around, waving arms, crying, laughing, seeing visions, or going into trances. This kind of religious excitement isn’t new; it’s as old as religion itself, from ancient places like Delphi and Endor.
