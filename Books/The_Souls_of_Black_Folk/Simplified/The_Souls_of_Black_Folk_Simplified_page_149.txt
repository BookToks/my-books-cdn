In the 20th century, all good people want to make sure that when different races compete, the best things—like goodness, beauty, and truth—win. We want to keep everything that is really great and strong for the future, not encourage greed, rudeness, or cruelty.

To make this happen, we need to study how different races interact honestly and fairly, without letting our hopes or fears change the facts. The South is a perfect place to study this because it has many complicated race issues. Even though many scientists don’t want to study it and most people think they already know about it, we have to pay serious attention. We have to ask: what are the real relationships between white and black people in the South? And we need honest answers, not excuses or blaming.

Today, how people live and relate depends on a few main things. First, where they live and how neighborhoods are arranged. Second, and most important now, how people work together to earn money and meet their needs. Third, politics—how people work together to run their communities, make laws, and pay taxes. Fourth, the exchange of ideas through talking, reading, and sharing opinions, which shapes what people think as a group. This also includes social activities like traveling, going to theaters, visiting friends, and marriage. Finally, there are religious and moral activities and helping others.

These are the main ways people living in the same area come into contact with each other. My job now is to explain, from my point of view, how black people in the South mix and interact with white people in these everyday ways.
