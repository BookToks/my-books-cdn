He wasn’t a bad guy, just a bit spoiled and used to getting his way, and as stubborn as his proud dad. He looked like a nice young man as he sat on a big black tree stump by the pine trees, swinging his legs and smoking.

“Why, there isn’t even a girl worth flirting with,” he grumbled. Then he saw a tall, thin girl coming quickly down the narrow path. At first, he watched her with interest, then laughed and said, “Well, if it isn’t Jennie, the little brown kitchen-maid! I never noticed how slim she is. Hey, Jennie! You haven’t kissed me since I got home,” he said cheerfully. The girl looked at him surprised and confused, said something unclear, and tried to walk past. But he was in a stubborn mood and grabbed her arm. Scared, she slipped away, and he ran after her through the tall pine trees, half teasing.

Far away, near the sea at the end of the path, John was coming slowly with his head down. He had just left school feeling tired and sad. He wanted to protect his mother by meeting his sister as she finished work to tell her he was kicked out of school. “I’ll leave,” he said slowly. “I’ll find a job and send for them. I can’t live here anymore.” Then anger inside him grew strong. He waved his arms and hurried up the path.

The big brown sea was calm and quiet. The air was still. The setting sun covered the twisted oak and tall pine trees with black and gold light.

There was no wind or sound from the clear sky. Only a dark-skinned man hurried along, heavy-hearted, not seeing the sun or sea. Suddenly, a scared cry broke the silence and woke the pine trees. He saw his dark-skinned sister struggling in the arms of a tall, fair-haired man.

He didn’t say anything. He grabbed a fallen tree branch and hit the man with all his anger and strength. The man’s body lay white and still under the pines, all covered in sunlight and blood. John looked at it like in a dream, then walked back to the house quickly and said softly, “Mom, I’m leaving—I’m going to be free.” She looked at him with blurry eyes and asked, “North, honey, are you going North again?” He looked at the North Star shining faintly over the water and said, “Yes, mom, I’m going North.” Then, without saying more, he went out to the narrow lane by the straight pines, sat on the big black stump, and looked at the blood where the body had been.
