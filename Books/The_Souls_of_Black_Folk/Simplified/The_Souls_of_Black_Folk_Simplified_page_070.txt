From birth until death, enslaved; in words and actions, powerless!

Hereditary slaves! Don’t you know that those who want to be free must fight for it themselves?

The most important thing about the history of African Americans since 1876 is the rise of Mr. Booker T. Washington. His influence started when people were beginning to forget the war and its ideas, and when big business was growing fast. At that time, young Black people felt unsure and confused—this is when he stepped up to lead.

Mr. Washington came with a simple, clear plan at the exact moment when the country felt a little embarrassed for giving so much sympathy to Black people and was now focusing on making money. His plan focused on teaching practical skills, making peace with the South, and accepting silence when it came to civil and political rights. This wasn’t a totally new idea; free Black people since 1830 had tried to build trade schools, and groups like the American Missionary Association had been teaching trades for a long time. Others had tried to work respectfully with Southern leaders.

But Mr. Washington was the first to connect these ideas fully. He put all his energy, hope, and faith into this plan, turning it from just an option into a real way of life. The story of how he did this is a really interesting look at human life.
