These numbers show what college-educated Black people do in their communities.

They are the leaders, the ones who set goals for the community, guide its ideas, and lead social changes. The Black community especially needs strong leaders because they donâ€™t have many traditions, customs, or strong family ties to rely on. These things have to be built over time.

Before the war, preachers were the leaders and the church was the most important social place for Black people. But many preachers then were not well-educated and sometimes behaved badly. It has been hard to replace those preachers with better-educated ones.

College-educated preachers can help a lot by working directly in the community and influencing other preachers and church members. Their work to improve society and inspire people is very important and valuable.
