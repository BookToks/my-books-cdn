A long time ago, he had played with that dead boy, running around under the big, quiet trees. The night got darker; he thought about the boys in Johnstown. He wondered how Brown was doing, and Carey? And Jones,––Jones? Wait, he was Jones! He wondered what they would all say when they found out, when they found out, in that huge dining room full of happy faces.

Then, as the starlight shined on him, he thought about the fancy ceiling of the big concert hall and heard soft, sweet music coming to him like a gentle breeze. Was it music, or the noise of people shouting and running? Yes, it was! The soft melody rose and fluttered like it was alive, making the ground shake like horses running and people yelling.

He leaned back and smiled at the sea, where the strange music was coming from, away from the dark shadows with the sounds of horses galloping fast. He tried to focus, leaned forward, and quietly hummed the "Song of the Bride"––“Freudig geführt, ziehet dahin.”* In the dim morning light, he watched shadows moving among the trees and heard horses thundering toward him. At last, they came rushing like a storm, and he saw a tired old man with white hair and angry red eyes. Oh, how he felt sorry for him,––really felt sorry––and wondered if he had the twisted rope. Then, as the storm surrounded him, he slowly stood up and closed his eyes, facing the sea.

And the world whistled loudly in his ears.
