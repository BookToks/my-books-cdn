Inside, there is a fireplace that is black and smoky, and usually shaky because it’s old. There is a bed or two, a table, a wooden chest, and a few chairs. A stray poster or newspaper is often the only decoration on the walls.

Sometimes, you might find a cabin that is very clean, with a warm fireplace and a friendly door. But most cabins are dirty and falling apart. They smell like food and people sleeping, don’t have good air, and don’t feel like a real home.

These cabins are very crowded. We usually think crowding only happens in cities, but that’s because we don’t know much about country life. In Dougherty County, families of eight or ten live in just one or two rooms. For every ten rooms meant for Black families, there are twenty-five people living there. In New York City, the worst crowded places have about twenty-two people for every ten rooms. Even though a small city room without a yard can be worse in some ways, the country homes still have serious problems.

But some things are better in the country. The homes have glass windows, a decent chimney, and a solid floor. The biggest plus for Black farmers is that they can spend most of their time outside in the fields instead of stuck inside small rooms.

There are four main reasons these homes are so bad: First, because of slavery’s history, Black people have always been given poor homes. White workers would get better housing and might work harder because of it. Second, Black people are used to these bad homes and usually don’t ask for better ones because they don’t know what better means. Third, landlords don’t realize that improving homes step by step is good business. A Black worker who has a bigger home and earns fifty cents a day would work better and make more profit than one crammed into one room and paid thirty cents. Finally, living in such bad conditions doesn’t encourage workers to become better farmers. If they want more, they move to town or look for other jobs. As tenant farmers, they feel stuck and just take the housing they get without complaining.

So, these Black farmers live in those kinds of homes. Families can be small or big. There are many single people, like widows and bachelors, and some broken families too.
