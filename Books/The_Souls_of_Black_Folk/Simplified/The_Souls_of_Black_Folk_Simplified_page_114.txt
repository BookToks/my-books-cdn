vii Of the Black Belt I am dark but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.

Don’t look down on me because I am dark, Because the sun has made my skin dark. My mother’s children were angry with me; They made me watch over the vineyards; But I did not take care of my own vineyard.

The Song of Solomon* A train from the North thundered by, and we woke up to see the red soil of Georgia stretching out flat and boring on both sides. Here and there were small, ugly villages, and thin men relaxed slowly at the train stations; then again came stretches of pine trees and clay. But we didn’t get sleepy or tired of looking; this place has history. Right across our tracks, three hundred and sixty years ago, Hernando de Soto* and his group wandered, searching for gold and the Great Sea; he and his tired followers disappeared into the dark forests to the west.

Here is Atlanta, the city of a hundred hills, with a mix of Western and Southern vibes, and its own busy life. Just a bit past Atlanta, to the southwest, is Cherokee land, and near where Sam Hose* was killed, you can stand on a spot that is now the center of the Negro problem—the heart of the nine million black people who are America’s legacy from slavery and the slave trade.
