Education isn’t just one thing, and it’s not just about schools. It’s the whole process of teaching and helping people learn, both inside and outside of school, to shape and grow them.

If we want to teach people who don’t know much and have bad habits, our education system needs to focus on two main goals. One is about giving knowledge and building good character. The other is about teaching kids the skills they need to get a job and make a living today. We try to do this with regular schools and trade or industrial schools.

But that’s not enough. We also need to train the teachers who work in these schools. They have to be smart, skilled, and understand the world we live in. There need to be teachers, and teachers who train other teachers. Trying to run schools without first training great teachers is just wasting money. Buildings and machines don’t teach—people do. It’s the well-trained, thoughtful teachers who really bring learning to life for kids, no matter their race or background.

Many thoughtful Black people have lost faith in education lately because some people criticize the colleges that train Black teachers. Schools like Fisk, Atlanta, Howard, and Straight were started by people who believed in freedom and equality. These colleges trained over 30,000 teachers who now work in Black schools. If schools like Hampton and Tuskegee succeed in training Black workers, it’s mainly because of the teachers trained at these colleges in the North and South.

Once, people thought the best education was just a boy sitting with a great teacher, like Mark Hopkins, and nothing else. But now, it seems like we need more than that—we need tools like sawmills and hammers, and sometimes we don’t even need a great teacher to get things done.
