Our songs, our hard work, our happiness, and our warnings have been shared with this country like a close friendship. Aren’t these things worth giving? Isn’t this effort important? Would America be America without Black people?

The hope that my ancestors sang about is still alive today.

If there is something good and powerful in the world, then one day America will break free from its problems, and those who are trapped will be free. Free like the sunshine coming through my windows in the morning, free like the fresh young voices singing to me from the city below—full of life and music.

My children, my little ones, are singing to the sunshine, and this is what they sing: The Sorrow Songs. The traveler gets ready, faces the morning, and keeps going on their journey.
