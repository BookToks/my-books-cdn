Even with all this, many important parts of how Black and white people work together for jobs and money are often ignored or not fully understood.

Most Americans can easily imagine a rich land ready to be developed, full of Black workers. They think the Southern problem is just about turning these workers into skilled employees by giving them training and money to invest. But the problem isn't that simple. These workers were trained for hundreds of years as slaves. Because of this, they have both good and bad habits from that time. They are willing and friendly but not very independent, careful, or good at planning ahead.

If the South’s economy grows quickly, these workers will have to compete hard with workers from all over the world. But they are at a disadvantage because their training is the opposite of what modern, independent workers need. What Black workers really need is good personal guidance and leaders who care about them, to teach them to be thoughtful, careful, and honest. You don’t need complicated ideas about race to see why this kind of group training is necessary after 250 years of being taught to obey, be careless, and steal.

After slavery ended, someone had the clear responsibility to lead and train Black workers. I won’t argue now about whether it was the job of the white former owners, the Northern helpers, or the government that freed the slaves. But I do believe someone should have made sure these workers were not left alone, without money, land, skills, organization, or even basic protection from law and order. They were left in a big land, not to slowly and carefully improve their lives, but to face tough competition from the best workers in a system where everyone fights for themselves and often ignores the rights or well-being of others.

We must remember that the Southern economy today is not like the old systems in the industrial North, England, or France. Those places had unions, laws, business customs, and lots of experience. The South’s new system is very different.
