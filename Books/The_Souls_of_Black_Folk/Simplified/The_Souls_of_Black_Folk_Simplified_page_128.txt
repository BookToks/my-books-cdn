There aren’t many signs of a romantic past here anymore. Instead, there’s a lot of modern land grabbing and people trying to make money. More white people are seen around, and farmers and hired workers have taken over from the old landlords who didn’t live here and charged high rents. The crops don’t look as rich as on better land, but they aren’t neglected either. There are fences and meadows here and there. Most of this land was poor and ignored by slave owners before the war. Since then, their nephews, poor white people, and Jewish people have taken it.

The farmers don’t make enough money to pay many workers, but they don’t want to sell their small farms. For example, there’s a Black man named Sanford who has worked as an overseer for fourteen years on the Ladson farm. He has spent a lot on fertilizer—enough to have bought a farm—but the owner won’t sell any land.

Two kids, a boy and a girl, are working hard in the fields on the farm where Corliss works. Corliss is young and brown-skinned, and he’s fixing the pig pens. He used to run a cotton gin, but a big company made ginning prices so low it’s barely worth it. He points to a fancy old house nearby and says it belongs to “Pa Willis.” Pa Willis was a strong and important Black leader who helped Black people for many years. He was a Baptist preacher, and when he died, two thousand Black people came to his funeral. They still remember him every year. His widow lives there now; she’s a small, sharp-looking woman who politely greeted us. Nearby lives Jack Delson, the richest Black farmer in the county. He’s a big, strong, happy man who owns 650 acres and has eleven Black farmers working for him. His home is clean and surrounded by flowers, and he has a little store next to it.

We passed the Munson place where a brave white widow is renting land and working hard, and the large Sennet plantation with a Black overseer. After that, the farms start to look different. Almost all the land belongs to Russian Jewish people; the overseers are white, and the houses are simple wooden cabins spread out. The rents are high, and many people work as day laborers or on contracts. Life is tough here, and people don’t have much time to talk. After a long, tiring ride, we were happy to reach Gillonsville. It’s a quiet group of farmhouses at a crossroads, with one store closed and the other run by a Black preacher.
