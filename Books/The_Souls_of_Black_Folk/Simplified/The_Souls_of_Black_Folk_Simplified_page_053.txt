This essay is about the time from 1861 to 1872 and how it affected African Americans in the United States. It tells the story of the Freedmen’s Bureau, a government group that tried to handle big problems about race and society during that time.

At first, Congress, the President, and the country said the war had nothing to do with slaves. But as the armies moved into Virginia and Tennessee, escaped slaves started showing up near the soldiers. They came at night, when campfires lit up the dark sky. There were old men, scared women with hungry kids, strong men, and girls—all homeless, hungry, and desperate.

Two leaders treated these escaped slaves differently. Ben Butler in Virginia said slaves were “contraband of war” and made them work. Fremont in Missouri said slaves were free under military law. Butler’s idea was accepted, but Fremont’s was quickly canceled. Then Halleck, the next leader, said no slaves should be allowed near the army, and if their owners came for them, they should be returned.

This rule was hard to follow. Some escaped slaves said they were free, some showed their owners had left them, and some were captured with forts and farms. Slaves were also helping the Confederate army by working and producing goods. The Secretary of War said slaves were a military resource and shouldn’t be given to the enemy. So, the army leaders changed their minds. Congress said escaped slaves couldn’t be returned to their owners, and Butler’s “contrabands” were accepted as workers for the army. This made things more complicated because more and more escaped slaves kept coming as the armies moved.

Then, the smart man in the White House saw what was coming and freed the slaves of rebels on New Year’s Day, 1863.
