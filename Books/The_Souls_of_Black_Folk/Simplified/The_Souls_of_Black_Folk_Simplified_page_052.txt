ii Of the Dawn of Freedom Careless seems the great Avenger; History’s lessons but record One death-grapple in the darkness ’Twixt old systems and the Word; Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne; Yet that scaffold sways the future, And behind the dim unknown Standeth God within the shadow Keeping watch above His own.
 
 Lowell.* The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the colorline,*––the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea. It was a phase of this problem that caused the Civil War; and however much they who marched South and North in 1861 may have fixed on the technical points of union and local autonomy as a shibboleth, all nevertheless knew, as we know, that the question of Negro slavery was the real cause of the conflict. Curious it was, too, how this deeper question ever forced itself to the surface despite effort and disclaimer. No sooner had Northern armies touched Southern soil than this old question, newly guised, sprang from the earth,––What shall be done with Negroes? Peremptory military commands, this way and that, could not answer the query; the Emancipation Proclamation 16 The Souls of Black Folk seemed but to broaden and intensify the difficulties; and the War Amendments* made the Negro problems of to-day.
