The big problem of the 1900s was about race — how darker-skinned and lighter-skinned people got along in places like Asia, Africa, America, and islands in the ocean. This problem was part of what caused the Civil War. Even though people fighting in 1861 talked a lot about whether states should have more power or stay united, everyone really knew the real issue was slavery.

It was strange how this problem kept coming up again and again, no matter what people said. As soon as the Northern armies entered the South, the question popped up: What should be done with Black people? Orders from the military didn’t solve this. Even the Emancipation Proclamation made things harder, and the changes to the law during the war created the race problems we still deal with today.
