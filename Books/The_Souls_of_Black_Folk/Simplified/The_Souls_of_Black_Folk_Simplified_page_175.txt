This is how things naturally are. The deaths of Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner showed Black people that using force to defend themselves is hopeless right now.

Political protection is getting harder to find, and money can only help a little. But there is one clear way to protect yourself—by tricking others, flattering them, being nice, and sometimes lying.

This is the same way Jewish people in the Middle Ages survived, and it affected how they acted for a long time. Today, a young Black person in the South who wants to do well can’t be open and honest or confident. Instead, they have to be quiet and careful, smart and sneaky; they must flatter people, smile through small insults, and ignore unfairness. Often, they even see lying as a way to get ahead.

They have to keep their real thoughts and dreams secret; they can’t complain or criticize. Patience, humility, and cleverness must replace boldness and courage. By doing this, they might find some chance to make money and live in peace. If not, there could be riots, moving away, or crime. This isn’t just a Southern problem—it’s how many less powerful groups have managed to join modern society.

The cost of joining culture is a lie.

In the North, things are different. Pushed out of their homes in the South, where their bold nature was shut down, Black people now live where it’s tough to find good jobs because of hard competition and racism. But through schools, newspapers, talks, and books, their minds start to open up. Their spirit, once trapped and small, grows free.

It’s no surprise that many react strongly—complaining loudly, wanting big changes, or staying angry and silent. Some fall into crime or bad habits and leave the church for gambling and brothels, filling poor neighborhoods in Chicago and Baltimore. Others, from better backgrounds, separate themselves from both white and Black groups and become a kind of upper class. They are educated but often hopeless, criticizing loudly without offering a way out. They look down on Southern Black people for being so obedient but don’t show how poor and oppressed people can live alongside those in power.
