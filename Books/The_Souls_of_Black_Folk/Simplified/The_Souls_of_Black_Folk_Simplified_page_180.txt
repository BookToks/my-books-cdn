The storm raged loudly above my head like a harsh, uncaring voice, and the wild forest seemed full of the angry curses of those who were weak. But I didn’t care, because I was safe at home with my wife and baby boy. Were you really so jealous of our little bit of happiness that you had to come here, Death?

His life was perfect, full of joy and love, with tears that made it even more beautiful—like a warm summer day by the Housatonic River. Everyone loved him; women kissed his curly hair, men looked seriously into his amazing eyes, and children gathered happily around him. I can still see him now, changing like the sky—from bright laughter to serious frowns, then thoughtful looks, as he watched the world. He didn’t see people as black or white, poor kid—the Veil that shadowed him hadn’t yet dimmed his bright spirit. He loved the white woman who cared for him and his black nurse too; in his little world, everyone was just a soul, not judged by color. I—and all people—are richer and better because of that small life. A wise woman who can see beyond the stars said after he died, “He will be happy There; he always loved beautiful things.” And I, more confused and blinded by my own troubles, sit here alone, whispering, “If he is still alive, and if There really is a There, then I hope he is happy, Fate!” The morning of his burial was bright and cheerful, with birds singing and sweet flowers blooming. The trees whispered to the grass, but the children were quiet and serious. Still, the day felt strange and unreal—as if it were just a shadow of life. We walked down a strange street behind a small white bundle of flowers, with a faint song in our ears. The busy city made noise around us, but the pale-faced men and women barely looked at us; they just glanced and said, “Niggers!” We couldn’t bury him in Georgia because the earth there is oddly red, so we took him north with his flowers and folded hands. But all this was for nothing! Where, God, under your wide blue sky, can my dark-skinned baby rest in peace—where respect, goodness, and true freedom live?

All day and all night, I felt a strange kind of happiness deep in my heart—don’t blame me if I see the world as dark through the Veil. My soul keeps whispering to me, “He is not dead, not dead, but escaped; not a slave, but free.” No mean cruelty will ever hurt his baby heart again, no teasing will spoil his joyful childhood.
