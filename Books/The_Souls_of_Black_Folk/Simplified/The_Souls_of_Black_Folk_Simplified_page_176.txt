People today really feel the times they live in, and it hurts them deeply when a barrier, like the Veil, keeps them apart. This pain is natural and makes their feelings even stronger and more frustrating.

Most Black people, both in the North and South, are somewhere between two very different ways of thinking about right and wrong. Their religious lives show this struggle too. Their churches are changing. Some are like cold, fancy groups that look like white groups except for skin color. Others have become big social and business places where people go for fun and news, avoiding hard questions inside and outside their community. They seem to say, “While we live, let’s enjoy life.”

But deep down, there is still a strong, real religious feeling in Black people’s hearts. Many powerful souls feel lost without the old guidance and are searching for new meaning in a dark time. One day, there will be a big change when the energy of millions pushes forward toward freedom, justice, and fairness—things now marked “For White People Only.”

O sister, sister, your first child,  
The hands that hold on and the feet that follow,  
The voice of the child’s blood still crying,  
Who remembers me?
