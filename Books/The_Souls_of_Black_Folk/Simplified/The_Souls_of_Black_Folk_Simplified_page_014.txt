Is America my only real goal? Should I try to push down everything about being Black inside me to fit in as just American? Does having Black blood mean I have a bigger duty to prove my identity than if I had German, Irish, or Italian blood?

This kind of constant questioning and doubt is causing many Black Americans to feel confused and unsure about who they are right now.

In ‘Strivings of the Negro People’, which later became the first chapter of The Souls of Black Folk, Du Bois changes how he thinks about this. Instead of focusing on personal doubt, he talks about something he calls ‘double consciousness’. He stops trying to define ‘race’ and instead looks closely at how prejudice affects Black people’s minds when they deal with others.

Du Bois shares a story from his childhood about the first time he felt the unfairness of racism. He calls it a ‘strange experience’ and says it’s better explained by a picture, like a ‘vast veil’, rather than just by the word race.

One of the most famous parts of his writing describes Black people as if they were born with a veil and a special ability to see two worlds. This American world doesn’t let them fully understand themselves. Instead, they see themselves through how others view them.

This feeling of ‘double consciousness’ is like always looking at yourself through other people’s eyes, judging your own soul by how the world looks at you with a mix of pity and amusement. Black people feel like they have two identities at once—American and Black. They have two different thoughts, two different goals, and two clashing ideas inside one person, and only their strong will keeps them from falling apart.

The history of Black Americans is the story of this struggle between these two sides.
