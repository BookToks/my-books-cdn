This place is like a copy of England from the early 1800s, before they made laws to protect workers. Back then, life was really hard and unfair, and people like the writer Carlyle were angry about it. 

After 1865, the control of the South didn’t go back to the old Southern gentlemen. Instead, it went to new people who ran the big businesses in the New South. These were poor white men who wanted money and power, careful and greedy Yankees, and clever but dishonest Jewish businessmen. 

The workers, both white and black, ended up under these new bosses, and it was bad for them. These bosses didn’t care about the workers’ feelings or needs—they only cared about making money. Because of this, all workers had to suffer. Even the white workers were not smart or skilled enough yet to protect themselves from the rich business owners. They had to work long hours, get low pay, have their kids work, and had no protection from being cheated or charged too much.

But black workers had it even worse. They faced racism that ranged from distrust by some white people to hatred from others. On top of that, their history of slavery made it hard for them to take advantage of new chances. The new opportunities mostly went to white people. 

The best people in the South left black workers with little help or protection. By law and tradition, they ended up victims of the worst and most dishonest people in their towns. The system of sharecropping, where farmers work land they don’t own, is not just because black people are lazy. It’s also because sneaky laws about debts and crimes were made to trap them so they could never escape. 

For example, in Georgia, I saw an honest, uneducated black man buy a farm by paying in parts three times. But then a clever Jewish man who sold him the farm took the money and the papers and left the black man without land—forcing him to work on his own farm for only thirty cents a day.
