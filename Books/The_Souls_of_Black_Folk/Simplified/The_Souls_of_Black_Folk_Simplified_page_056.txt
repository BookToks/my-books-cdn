There was a military plan that said: “The islands from Charleston going south, the empty rice fields near the rivers for thirty miles from the sea, and the land near the St. John’s River in Florida, are set aside for freed Black people.” This was called “Field-order Number Fifteen.” All these plans and rules confused the government and the country. Right after the Emancipation Proclamation, a man named Representative Eliot tried to create a Bureau of Emancipation, but it never moved forward.

The next June, a group chosen by the Secretary of War said yes to creating a temporary office to help freed Black people with jobs and protection. People sent letters to President Lincoln asking for a big, organized plan to help freed Black people move from forced work to free work in a kind and smart way. Some small steps were taken, like letting Treasury agents handle the freed people’s needs. Laws in 1863 and 1864 told these agents to take care of empty lands for up to a year and to make sure freed Black people had jobs and were looked after.

Most army officers were glad to have help with “Negro affairs,” and in July 1864, Secretary Fessenden made good rules that General Howard later followed. Treasury agents rented out lots of land in the Mississippi Valley and gave many Black people work. But in August 1864, these new rules were stopped for “public policy” reasons, and the army took control again.

At the same time, Congress was working on the issue. In March, the House passed a bill by just two votes to create a Bureau for Freedmen in the War Department. Charles Sumner, who handled the bill in the Senate, thought freed people and empty lands should be managed by the same department, so he suggested moving the Bureau to the Treasury Department instead.
