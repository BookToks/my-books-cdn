People believed that if it was wrong or useless for the country to protect Black people, then the only choice was to let Black people protect themselves by giving them the right to vote. Politicians thought the same way; they said if they couldn’t fix the South using white votes, they could do it with Black votes. So fairness and power worked together.

The choice wasn’t really between full or limited voting rights for Black people. If it were, most people, Black and white, would have chosen limited rights. Instead, it was a choice between voting rights and slavery, after so much blood and money had been spent to end slavery. No Southern lawmakers wanted Black people to vote no matter what. They didn’t believe Black people could work freely without strict limits. Most white Southerners thought freeing Black people was a mistake and felt it was their duty to undo it. In this situation, giving Black people the vote was necessary. It was the least a guilty nation could do for a wronged group, and the only way to force the South to accept the end of the war. So, Black voting rights ended the Civil War but started racial conflict. Some felt thankful to Black people who were hurt in this process, while others didn’t care or looked down on them.

If politics had been less stressful, and people less against helping Black people, a better plan could have been made. This might have been a permanent Freedmen’s Bureau with schools for Black children, fair job offices, protection in courts, and places to help people save money and build homes. This big effort could have been a great way to teach citizenship and solve the hard problems Black people faced—problems we still haven’t solved today.

But in 1870, this idea was impossible partly because the Freedmen’s Bureau itself thought its work was only temporary. It believed giving Black people the vote was the final solution to all the problems.
