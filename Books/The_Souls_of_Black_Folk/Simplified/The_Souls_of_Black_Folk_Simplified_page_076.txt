Booker T. Washington and others focus a lot on work and money, almost like it’s the most important thing in life. At the same time, people from more advanced races are meeting those from less developed races more often, which makes feelings about race stronger. Mr. Washington’s plan kind of accepts the idea that Black people are less than others. Also, in America, after the war, there was more racism against Black people, and Mr. Washington asked them to give up many of their rights as citizens. In the past, when people faced strong racism, Black people usually fought back with pride. But now, Mr. Washington says they should accept their situation. Usually, when a group faces hard times, they believe it’s more important to respect themselves than to own land or houses. If a group stops fighting for respect, they might lose their chance to be treated fairly.

Some say the only way Black people can survive is by accepting their place. Mr. Washington clearly asks Black people to give up three things for now: political power, fighting for civil rights, and higher education for young Black people. Instead, they should focus on learning trades, making money, and trying to get along with the South. He has been asking for this for over fifteen years, and for about ten years, his ideas have been popular. But what has happened in return?

During these years, three things happened: 1. Black people lost the right to vote. 2. Laws were made that treated Black people as second-class citizens. 3. Support for schools that gave higher education to Black people was taken away.

These things didn’t happen directly because of Mr. Washington, but his ideas helped make them happen faster. So the big question is: Can nine million Black people really get ahead economically if they don’t have political rights, are treated like servants, and barely get chances to develop their best leaders?
