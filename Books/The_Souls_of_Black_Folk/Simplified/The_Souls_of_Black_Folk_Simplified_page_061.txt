The act of 1866 gave the Freedmen’s Bureau its final shape—the way people will remember it. It extended the Bureau’s life until July 1868 and allowed more assistant commissioners, kept army officers who left regular service, and let freedmen buy some lands cheaply. It also allowed the sale of Confederate property to fund schools for Black people and gave the Bureau more power to interpret laws.

The government in the South, which hadn’t fully rebuilt yet, was mostly controlled by the Freedmen’s Bureau. In many places, the military leader was also the assistant commissioner. This made the Bureau like a real government. It made laws, enforced them, collected taxes, punished crimes, used military force, and took whatever steps it thought were needed to reach its goals.

Of course, the Bureau didn’t always use all its powers all the time. But as General Howard said, almost every important issue in society needed the Bureau’s help at some point. To understand and judge this huge job, we have to remember what was happening in the late 1860s. Lee had surrendered, Lincoln was dead, and President Johnson and Congress were fighting. The Thirteenth Amendment had passed, the Fourteenth was waiting, and the Fifteenth came into effect in 1870.

Violent raiding, a leftover from the war, mostly targeted Black people. The South was waking up from a bad dream, facing poverty and big social changes.

If everything had been calm, with neighbors getting along and money flowing, helping four million freed slaves become independent and equal members of society would have been a huge challenge. But when you add the hate and pain from the war, the cruelty, suspicion, and hunger, this kind of social change was almost doomed to fail. The very idea of the Bureau was shocking to many in the South, where people had refused to even think about living alongside free Black people for over two hundred years—they saw it as a crazy experiment.
