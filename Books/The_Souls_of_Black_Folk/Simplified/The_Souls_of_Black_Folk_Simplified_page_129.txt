People tell stories about how busy Gillonsville used to be before all the railroads came to Albany. Now, it’s mostly just a memory. Riding down the street, we stop at the preacher’s house and sit on the porch.

It was one of those scenes you don’t forget easily: a small, wide house with a cozy roof that covered a little porch. After the long, hot drive, we sat there drinking cool water. The talkative little storekeeper, who I see every day, was there. So was an old black woman quietly fixing some pants without saying a word. A ragged, unlucky-looking person stopped by just to see the preacher. Finally, the neat and smart preacher’s wife joined us. She was plump and yellow-skinned.

“Do you own land?” the wife asked. “Well, only this house,” she said. Then she added quietly, “We did buy seven hundred acres up there and paid for it, but they cheated us out of it. Sells was the owner.”

“Sells!” repeated the ragged person leaning on the porch rail and listening. “He’s a real cheat. I worked for him for thirty-seven days this spring, and he paid me with cardboard checks that were supposed to be cashed at the end of the month. But he never cashed them and kept making excuses. Then the sheriff came and took my mule, corn, and furniture.”

“Furniture?” I asked. “But the law says furniture can’t be taken.”

“Well, he took it anyway,” said a hard-faced man.
