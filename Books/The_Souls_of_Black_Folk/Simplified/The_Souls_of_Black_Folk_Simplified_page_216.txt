Du Bois talks about ideas that he later explained more in the first chapter of *The Souls of Black Folk*, called “Of Our Spiritual Strivings.” This speech was published by the Academy in 1897 as one of their Occasional Papers.

Black Americans have always cared deeply about talks on where races come from and where they’re going. This is mostly because many discussions about race assume things about their natural abilities, political rights, intelligence, and morals that they felt were wrong. Because of this, they have tried to ignore race differences, believe strongly that all people come from the same blood created by God, and talk about human brotherhood as if a better future is already coming.

Still, when we think clearly, we have to admit that people are divided into races. In the U.S., two very different races have come together, and figuring out how these groups will live together in the future is very important and marks a big moment in human history.

So, when planning how to move forward and grow, we sometimes need to look beyond smaller problems like separate schools, unfair pay, and lynching. We should look at the bigger question of race in human life and use broad knowledge and careful thinking to create big ideas and rules that can help us handle everyday problems. We know that all efforts must follow natural laws, and no matter how hard we try, going against how the world works won’t succeed. The question we need to seriously think about is: What does race really mean? What has been the rule for how races develop in the past? And what can the history of race development teach Black people today?

When we try to understand what makes races different, it’s hard to find a clear answer right away. In the past, people have suggested many ways to tell races apart, like by skin color, hair type, skull shape, and language.
