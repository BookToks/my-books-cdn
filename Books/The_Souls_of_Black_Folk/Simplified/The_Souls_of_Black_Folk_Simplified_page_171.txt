Let’s shift our focus from the church’s outside appearance to the more important inner moral life of the people in it. The Black community has often been described as very religious, with deep feelings that naturally turn toward the supernatural. With a rich imagination and a strong connection to nature, the African people who were brought here believed in a world full of gods, spirits, and magic. 

For them, slavery was like evil winning over them. All the bad powers seemed to be against them, and they felt angry and wanted revenge. They used their traditional beliefs and practices, like magic, witchcraft, and strange rituals, to try to fight back. Sometimes these rituals even included human sacrifices. Nighttime ceremonies and spells were common, with witch doctors and spiritual leaders playing a big role in their community. This mix of superstition became even stronger over time.

Even though some groups, like the Maroons and Danish blacks, fought hard, the slave owners’ power eventually wore down the rebellion. By the mid-1700s, slaves had accepted their low place in a new economic system and were ready for a different way of thinking. The ideas in Christianity about patiently accepting suffering fit their situation well.

Slave owners understood this and supported spreading religion within limits. The harsh treatment of slaves made the qualities that made them useful to masters even stronger: politeness turned into humility, inner strength became obedience, and their natural love for beauty turned into an ability to suffer silently. Losing hope in this life, slaves clung to the promise of the next life. They believed in a powerful Spirit who told them to be patient now, through pain and hardship, until the day came when He would bring them freedom. Their preachers reminded them of this, and their songs said, “Children, we all shall be free when the Lord appears!”
