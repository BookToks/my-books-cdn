The Black community can’t just say that racism is the only reason for their situation, and white people in the South can’t just say that the Black community’s situation is why they are prejudiced. Both ideas are connected like cause and effect. Changing only one side won’t fix the problem. Both sides need to change, or nothing will get much better.

Black people can’t keep facing unfair treatment and strict racial divisions without feeling discouraged and falling behind. And people use the Black community’s struggles as a reason to treat them even worse. Only by working together with understanding and kindness between races at this important time in our country can justice win.

“Mind and soul working together can create something even greater.”

The idea of true beauty is something that touches everyone everywhere. It’s so perfect that it’s hard to fully see. Even when things seem lost or broken, real peace can only come from that beauty.
