I could see this might lead to a big mix-up between races, where everyone just tries to grab whatever they can.  

The Souls of Black Folk is known for its special opening quotes, which mix poems from Europe with bits of songs. In the ‘Forethought,’ these songs are described as a kind of haunting music that came from Black people in America a long time ago.  

At first, Du Bois wanted to end the book with a short story called ‘Of the Coming of John.’ But his editor, Francis Fisher Browne, convinced him to add a chapter about ‘The Sorrow Songs’ instead. This chapter says that Negro spirituals are the music of a sad people who have faced a lot of pain and hope for a better world.  

The title ‘Sorrow Songs’ might come from Frederick Douglass’s 1845 book, where he said that hearing these songs would show people how terrible slavery really was, even more than reading many books about it. Du Bois called these songs ‘the clear message of the slave to the world.’  

There’s a story about a song sung by Du Bois’s great-great-grandmother. The important thing is that the music itself carries this message of hope and struggle, even if people don’t fully understand the words. The song was passed down for over 200 years, and even today, we sing it knowing its music’s meaning, even if the words are unclear.  

The two opening quotes in the book are hopeful because they suggest that poetry and music can come together in a way that connects different experiences.
