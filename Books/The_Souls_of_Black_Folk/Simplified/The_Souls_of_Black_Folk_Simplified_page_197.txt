It was noon on a gray, cloudy day when he arrived. The Black people filled the train station, with a few white people around the edges—a happy crowd saying “Good morning” and “Howdy,” laughing, joking, and bumping into each other.

Mother sat by the window watching, but sister Jennie stood on the platform, nervously touching her dress. She was tall and slim, with soft brown skin and loving eyes hidden behind messy hair. John stood up sadly as the train stopped because he was thinking about the "Jim Crow" car. He stepped onto the platform and paused: a small, dirty station, a colorful but messy Black crowd, and a long row of broken-down shacks next to a muddy ditch. He felt overwhelmed by how dirty and small everything was. He looked for his mother but couldn’t find her, kissed the tall, strange girl who called him brother without much feeling, said a few short words, and then started walking quietly up the street. He just tipped his hat to one eager old lady, surprising her. The people were confused. Was this cold, quiet man really John? Where was his smile and friendly handshake? “He looked kind of down,” said the Methodist preacher. “Seemed really stuck up,” said a Baptist woman. But the white postmaster, standing nearby, spoke for his people clearly. “That damn Nigger,” he said while carrying the mail and chewing tobacco, “has gone North and got full of foolish ideas; but those won’t work in Altamaha.” Then the crowd slowly left.

The welcome meeting at the Baptist Church didn’t go well. Rain ruined the barbecue, and thunder spoiled the ice cream.

That night, when the speeches began, the church was packed. The three preachers had prepared well, but somehow John’s attitude made everything feel dull—he seemed cold and distracted, and so controlled that the Methodist preacher couldn’t get excited or hear anyone say “Amen.” The Presbyterian prayer got only weak responses, and even the Baptist preacher, who stirred up a little excitement, got so mixed up in his favorite sentence that he had to stop about fifteen minutes earlier than he wanted.
