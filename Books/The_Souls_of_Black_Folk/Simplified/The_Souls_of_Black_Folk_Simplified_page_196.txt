When the soft, sad sound of the violins finally played, John suddenly saw a picture in his mind of his far-away home—the big eyes of his sister and his mother’s tired, serious face. His heart felt heavy, sinking down deep like the sand by the shore at Altamaha, but then it lifted up again with the last, gentle cry of a swan that faded into the sky.

John sat so still and focused that at first he didn’t notice the usher gently tapping his shoulder and politely saying, “Will you come this way, please, sir?” Surprised, he quickly stood up when the usher tapped him again. As he turned to leave, he looked straight at a fair-haired young man. For the first time, the young man saw that John was his old friend from childhood, and John realized he was the Judge’s son. The white John was shocked and froze, while the black John smiled a little and then followed the usher down the aisle. The manager felt very sorry and explained that there had been a mistake selling John a seat already taken. He promised to give the money back and apologized again, but before he finished, John had already left, walking fast across the square and down the wide streets. Passing the park, he buttoned his coat and said to himself, “John Jones, you’re a natural-born fool.” Then he went home, wrote a letter, tore it up, wrote another, and threw it in the fire.

Finally, he grabbed a piece of paper and wrote: “Dear Mother and Sister—I am coming—John.” As he got on the train, John thought to himself, “Maybe I’m to blame for fighting against what’s meant to be, just because it seems hard and unpleasant. My duty is clear now; maybe they’ll let me help with the problems in Altamaha, maybe not. ‘I will go in to the King, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.’” Then he dreamed and made plans for his life’s work, as the train sped south.

Down in Altamaha, after seven long years, everyone knew John was coming. The homes were cleaned and tidied up, especially one. The gardens and yards looked neat, and Jennie bought a new gingham dress. After some careful talking, all the black Methodists and Presbyterians agreed to join in a big welcome at the Baptist Church. As the day got closer, people talked warmly on every street corner about exactly what John had done and what he might do next.
