They showed what Black people could achieve. Their own hard lives and strong culture spoke louder than any speeches. These were the people who helped end American slavery. As Maria Weston Chapman once said, many talented Black authors, editors, lawyers, speakers, and gentlemen have proved themselves. This gave hope and big dreams to both Black and white people. It helped white people accept Black freedom, and made Black people hate the idea of being slaves, just like white people do where this influence reached.

We need to make that strong influence even stronger! Before groups like the American Anti-slavery Society existed, the only enslaved Black people anyone saw were rare examples like Cudjoe or Dinah, who stayed strong even in slavery. Now, thanks to this society, Black people, like white people, can be leaders and build great things. Where did these Black abolitionists learn? Some, like Frederick Douglass, taught themselves but learned a lot. Others, like Alexander Crummell and McCune Smith, went to famous universities abroad. Most studied in Black schools in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, taught by college-educated teachers like Russworm from Dartmouth, and white teachers like Neau and Benezet. After slavery ended, new smart leaders like Langston, Bruce, Elliot, Greener, Williams, and Payne helped their people through politics, writing, and raising morals. Today, some people make fun of them, saying that after freedom, Black leadership should have started with farming, not politics. This is a silly and harmful lie. For 250 years, Black slaves worked hard on farms, but it didn’t help until laws gave them freedom and rights. Even now, if Black people don’t have political rights and proper protection, they will stay poor and uneducated, controlled by bad people. Everyone who thinks clearly knows this, even if they don’t say it.

Now, we live in a time when people are scared and unsure, where loud wrong ideas and weak compromises happen. People don’t always stand up for Truth and Right. Who leads Black people today? The talented few, of course. But when these smart leaders are noticed, people who only follow the average get scared and say, “These leaders are rare; look at all the death, sickness, and crime—that’s normal.” Of course, those bad things are common because a foolish nation made them that way. For 300 years, this country hurt Black people who tried to be brave, hurt Black women who tried to be good, crushed young Black people who tried to dream, and encouraged weakness, bad behavior, and not caring.
