A young Black man sat in the wagon, driving without much energy, his elbows resting on his knees. His dark-skinned wife sat next to him, quiet and serious.

“Hello!” shouted my driver, who often talks to people in a bold way, though they seem used to it. “What do you have there?” The man stopped and said, “Meat and meal.” The meat was a big, thin piece of fatty pork covered in salt, lying uncovered in the wagon. The meal was in a white bag.

“How much did you pay for the meat?” “Ten cents a pound.” It could have been bought for six or seven cents if paid in cash.

“And the meal?” “Two dollars.” The cash price in town was one dollar and ten cents.

This man was paying five dollars for things he could have bought for three dollars if he had cash. He could even have grown these things himself for one to one and a half dollars.

But it’s not all his fault. Black farmers started off behind, already in debt. This wasn’t their choice but the result of a careless country that ignored the problems after slavery ended. Once in debt, it’s very hard for a whole group of people to get ahead.

In 1898, a year when cotton prices were low, out of 300 tenant families, 175 ended the year owing $14,000; 50 broke even, and 75 made only $1,600 total profit. The total debt of Black tenant families in the county was at least $60,000. In better years, things improve, but usually most tenants finish the year in debt or just breaking even, meaning they work only for food and clothes. This system is clearly unfair. Who is to blame?

The reasons are complicated but clear. One big cause, besides the country’s mistake of letting former slaves start with nothing, is that many shop owners and bosses in the Black Belt think they must keep Black workers trapped in debt to make them work. At first, some pressure was needed to get lazy workers moving; even today, many Black laborers need more supervision than most workers in the North.
