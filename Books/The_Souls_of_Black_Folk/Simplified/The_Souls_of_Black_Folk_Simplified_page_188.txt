But Alexander Crummell said slowly and with great feeling, “I will never enter your church in those conditions.” Then he turned and walked into a very dark and scary place. You might have only seen his body getting weaker, with coughs and sickness; but inside, his soul was hurting even more. He found a small church in New York, the same church his father went to. He worked there even though he was poor and hungry, and other priests treated him badly. Feeling almost hopeless, he traveled across the ocean, asking for help. Some English men, like Wilberforce and Stanley, helped him. Sir Benjamin Brodie even let him rest at Queen’s College in Cambridge, where he stayed until he got his degree in 1853. But he still felt restless and unhappy, so he decided to go to Africa. There, among the people hurt by the slave trade, he searched for a better life.

This man was trying to find hope and meaning. What he went through wasn’t really living — it was like his soul was lost and looking for itself. He struggled to find where he belonged in the world, always feeling haunted by a deep sadness — like his soul had failed its purpose. He wandered for over twenty years, always asking himself, “Why am I here on Earth?” In his small New York church, he felt trapped. In the fancy English university, he heard the cries of millions far away. In the dangerous swamps of West Africa, he felt alone and powerless.

You won’t be surprised by his strange journey — especially if you’ve ever faced life’s hard questions and felt confused. If life’s problems are hard for you to handle, imagine how much harder they are for a black boy like him. If it’s tough for you to find your purpose, it’s even tougher for him. If you feel sick from fighting your battles, remember his fights were even harder. No wonder many travelers like him give up! No wonder there are so many criminals and broken people in the world. The dark valley of death rarely lets travelers come back.

But Alexander Crummell did come back. After facing hate, despair, doubt, and humiliation, he finally returned home. He was humble but strong, gentle but determined.
