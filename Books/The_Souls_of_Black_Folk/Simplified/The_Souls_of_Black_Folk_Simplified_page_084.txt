They were real with each other. The mother would tell the father off for being too soft; Josie would scold the boys for being careless; and everyone knew it was really hard to make a living farming on a rocky hillside.

I got the job as the teacher. I remember riding a horse to the commissioner’s house with a friendly young white man who wanted to teach at the white school. The road ran along a stream; the sun was shining and the water made a pretty sound as we rode. “Come in,” said the commissioner, “Have a seat. Yes, that certificate will work. Stay for dinner. How much do you want to be paid?” I thought, “This is great,” but then I felt the sad truth: they ate first, and I ate alone.

The schoolhouse was a small log cabin, once used to store corn. It stood in a fenced yard with thorn bushes, near a really nice spring. The door was missing, but there was a big, old fireplace inside. The logs had big gaps that acted like windows. There wasn’t much furniture. A faded blackboard sat in the corner. My desk was made from three boards held together carefully, and the chair I borrowed from the landlady had to be given back every night. I wasn’t sure what to do about seats for the kids. I dreamed of neat desks and chairs like back home, but instead there were rough wooden benches, sometimes without legs or backs. They made it hard to nap without falling, especially since the floor wasn’t very safe.

One hot morning in late July, school started. I was nervous when I heard little feet coming down the dusty road, and saw a line of serious faces and bright eyes looking at me. First came Josie and her brothers and sisters. Josie worked hard and wanted to learn, dreaming of going to a big school in Nashville even though she had a lot to do at home. Then came the Dowell family from their farm near Alexandria—Fanny, with her smooth dark skin and curious eyes; Martha, who was brown and quiet; the pretty wife of a brother; and the younger kids.

Then there were the Burkes—two boys with brown and yellow skin, and a tiny proud little girl. Fat Reuben’s chubby little girl came too, with golden skin and hair, serious and loyal.
