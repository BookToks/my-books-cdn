When a nation or a social group tries to get ahead, it often means a tough and painful fight that many lucky people don’t understand.

In this part of the Black Belt, life is hard. Only six percent of the people have been able to own their own small farms. Even those owners don’t always keep their land because it depends a lot on how well cotton sells.

Ninety-four percent have tried to get land but failed. Half of these people live like workers who have no hope of owning land. Many of them are moving to towns to find a way out.

Looking at how land is owned by Black families shows this trend. In 1898, there were many small farms near towns where people could be part of town life. The number of small farms grew a lot compared to 1890, when there were fewer small farms and more big ones.

For every landowner who left the tough country life for town, many workers without land followed. It’s strange how problems from the countryside end up in the towns. But maybe, in places like Dougherty County, towns can solve these problems better than cities can.
