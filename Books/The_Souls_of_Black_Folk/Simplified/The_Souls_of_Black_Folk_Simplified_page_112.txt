I won’t say these arguments are completely right, and I won’t say there isn’t another side to the story. But I do believe that almost every one of the nine million Black people in this country faces these issues every day like they are harsh realities.

The big question for the future is how to stop these millions from getting stuck thinking about the wrongs of the past and the problems they have now. Instead, they should focus all their energy on working happily and together with their white neighbors to build a bigger, fairer, and better future.

One smart way to do this is by connecting Black people more closely to the big job opportunities in the South. Schools, trade schools, and hands-on training are helping with this. But that’s not enough. Real knowledge has to come from colleges and universities to build a strong, lasting foundation.

Black people will face many social problems, like work and pay, family and home life, morals, and understanding what really matters in life. Because they are often separated from others, they will have to solve a lot of these problems on their own. Can these problems be solved without study, deep thinking, and learning from past experiences? It’s much more dangerous to have half-trained minds and shallow thinking than to have too much education or too much refinement.

We have the intelligence to create a Black college that is well-run and prepared to avoid making mistakes or being too casual. Black people won’t believe that having a full stomach is all that matters if their minds are empty.

They already have a sense that the path to peace, honest work, and true dignity needs smart guidance. There needs to be a caring, respectful connection between less educated Black people and those who have been freed by education and culture.

So, the role of a Black college is clear: it must keep good education standards, help improve the lives of Black people, and assist in solving problems between races and working together. Most importantly, it must help develop strong, capable people.

Above all the ideas of modern socialism and the power of the masses, there must be a respect for the individual person who wants to understand themselves and the world. This person wants freedom to grow and develop, to love, hate, and work in their own way, free from old and new limits.
