Right away, nine assistant commissioners were chosen. They were told to hurry to their work areas, slowly close the relief centers, and help poor people support themselves. They acted like judges where there were no courts or where Black people weren’t treated as free. They also set up marriage records for former slaves, made sure freedmen could pick their own bosses, and helped create fair work contracts. The instructions ended by saying that simple good faith from everyone involved would make the assistant commissioners’ jobs easier and help everyone’s well-being.

As soon as the work started and the system and local groups began to form, two big problems showed up that changed the whole plan. First, there were abandoned lands in the South. The North had hoped that freed slaves could be given the land their old owners lost, which some thought was fair. But this idea meant either taking away a lot of private land or spending a lot of money. Congress hadn’t given any money, and once general amnesty was announced, the 800,000 acres of abandoned land controlled by the Freedmen’s Bureau quickly disappeared.

The second problem was organizing the Bureau’s work across such a large area. Creating a new system and sending out qualified officials to do this big job was hard. It was even harder because they had to fit this new system into a messy, already existing one that helped and controlled former slaves. Plus, the agents had to be found from an army still busy fighting a war—soldiers who weren’t really suited for sensitive social work—or from questionable followers of the army. So after a year of hard work, the problem seemed even harder to solve than before.

Still, that year’s work did three important things: it eased a lot of physical suffering; it helped 7,000 runaways leave crowded cities and go back to farms; and best of all, it started the important work of schoolteachers from New England.
