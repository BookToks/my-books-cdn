Mother and child are sung, but seldom father; fugitive and weary wanderer call for pity and affection, but there is little of wooing and wedding; the rocks and the mountains are well known, but home is unknown.

Of deep successful love there is ominous silence, and in one of the oldest of these songs there is a depth of history and meaning: A black woman said of the song, “It can’t be sung without a full heart and a troubled sperrit.” The same voice sings here that sings in the German folk-song: “Jetz Geh i’ an’s brunele, trink’ aber net.”* Of death the Negro showed little fear, but talked of it familiarly and even fondly as simply a crossing of the waters, perhaps––who 174 The Souls of Black Folk knows?
