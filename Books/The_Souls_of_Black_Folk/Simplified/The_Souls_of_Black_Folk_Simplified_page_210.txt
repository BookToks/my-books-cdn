Mothers and children are often sung about, but fathers are not mentioned much. People who are tired and running away ask for sympathy and care, but there isn’t much talk about falling in love or getting married. The rocks and mountains are well known, but what home really is remains a mystery.

A strange mix of love and helplessness comes through in the song: “There’s my old mother, been waiting at the hill so long; about time she crosses over, gets home soon.” Sometimes, you hear the sad cries of those without mothers and goodbyes to a child. Love songs are rare and usually either happy and light or very sad. Songs about deep, true love are almost never heard. One of the oldest songs has a lot of history and meaning. A black woman once said, “You can’t sing this song without feeling it deeply and having a troubled heart.” 

The same kind of voice is heard in German folk songs too. When it comes to death, Black people didn’t fear it much. They talked about it simply, even kindly, as if it were just crossing a river—maybe no one really knows.
