Camp life and the new freedom were making life hard for the freedmen in different ways. New ways to organize work started to appear here and there, depending on chance and local situations. One idea, Pierce’s Port Royal plan, involved leasing plantations and guiding workers, showing a basic way to manage things.

In Washington, the military governor, after being asked by the superintendent, opened up confiscated estates for the fugitives to farm. Black farm villages grew there near the Capitol. General Dix gave land to freedmen at Fortress Monroe, and similar things happened in the South and West. The government and kind groups provided tools and supplies, and the freedmen slowly started working again.

These early systems of control grew into small governments. For example, General Banks in Louisiana managed 90,000 black people, 50,000 workers, and a yearly budget over $100,000. His government made 4,000 paychecks a year, registered all freedmen, listened to complaints and fixed problems, collected taxes, and set up public schools. Colonel Eaton, in Tennessee and Arkansas, took care of 100,000 freedmen, leased 7,000 acres of cotton land, and fed 10,000 poor people each year. In South Carolina, General Saxton took over from Pierce and the Treasury officials. He sold seized estates, leased abandoned plantations, supported schools, and welcomed thousands of poor followers after Sherman’s tough march to the sea.

During Sherman’s raid through Georgia, you could see three main groups: the Conqueror (the army leader), the Conquered (those who lost), and the Negro (the freedmen). Some people focus on the strong soldiers or the defeated Southerners, but to me, the most important were the freedmen who followed behind the army. They moved like a dark cloud, sometimes making the army twice as large and almost stopping it. Even when ordered to go back or when bridges were destroyed, they kept moving forward. Finally, they reached Savannah as a starving, naked crowd of tens of thousands.
