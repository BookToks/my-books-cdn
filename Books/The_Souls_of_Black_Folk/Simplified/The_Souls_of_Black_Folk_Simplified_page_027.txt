I just read parts of it again for the first time in years. In chapters VII, VIII, and IX, there are five times when Jews are mentioned. Years ago, Jacob Schiff wrote to me about these mentions, saying they seemed unfair. I said I didn’t mean to be racist or prejudiced and promised to check those parts in future editions. But new editions came out without me seeing them, and I forgot about it.

Now that I read it again, I see these words could cause harm if left as they are. First, I’m not even sure if the “foreign exploiters” I talked about in the Black Belt were really Jews. I just believed what people told me, but now I wonder if Russian Jews were even in Georgia then. Even if some were, I was talking about unfair treatment, not about the whole race or religion. I didn’t realize that by focusing on the group’s name, I was unfairly blaming all of them, just like how my own people were and still are wrongly blamed.

Because of this, and because it’s even more important to be fair now, I want to change these parts if the book is published again.

When Du Bois told Blue Heron what to fix on March 16, 1953, he wrote a paragraph to add at the end of Chapter VII, ‘Of the Black Belt’. It said: In the last chapter, ‘Jews’ are mentioned five times, and Jacob Schiff once said this looked like anti-Semitism. I denied it then, but now I see how it could seem that way. What I wanted to criticize was the unfair treatment of Black workers, and that some immigrant Jews were involved was just a small part, not the main point. I showed my support for Jewish people better on page 152. This shows how easy it is to accidentally blame a whole group.

This paragraph wasn’t added to the 1953 edition, probably because the mentions were already changed in the text.
