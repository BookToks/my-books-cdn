NOTE ON THE TEXT  
This version of The Souls of Black Folk uses the same text as the first edition, which came out on April 18, 1903, by A. C. McClurg and Company.

Nine of the fourteen chapters were updated versions of essays that were first published in different magazines. The first chapter, "Of Our Spiritual Strivings," is a changed version of "Strivings of the Negro People" from Atlantic Monthly in August 1897. Chapter II, "Of the Dawn of Freedom," is a new version of "The Freedman’s Bureau" from Atlantic Monthly in March 1901. Chapter III, "Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others," is a longer and updated version of "The Evolution of Negro Leadership" from The Dial on July 16, 1901. Chapter IV, "Of the Meaning of Progress," is based on "A Negro Schoolmaster in the New South," from Atlantic Monthly in January 1899. Chapter VI, "Of the Training of Black Men," is a revised essay with the same title from Atlantic Monthly in September 1902. Chapters VII and VIII, "Of the Black Belt" and "Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece," come from one essay called "The Negro as He Really Is" from World’s Work in June 1901. Chapter IX, "Of the Sons of Master and Man," updates "The Relation of Negroes to the Whites in the South" from Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, July–December 1901. Chapter X, "Of the Faith of the Fathers," revises "The Religion of the American Negro" from New World: A Quarterly Review of Religion, Ethics and Theology, December 1900.

Chapters V, "Of the Wings of Atalanta"; IX, "Of the Passing of the First-Born"; XII, "Of Alexander Crummell"; XIII, "Of the Coming of John"; and XIV, "The Sorrow Songs," were written just for this book.

The book became very popular. McClurg published 24 editions between 1903 and 1940. In 1935, the publisher told Du Bois that they had sold 15,000 copies. In January 1949, Du Bois bought the original printing plates from McClurg for $100. In the fall of 1953, a special Fiftieth Anniversary Jubilee Edition of The Souls of Black Folk was published by Blue Heron Press in New York.
