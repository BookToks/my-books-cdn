This strong belief in religion, shown clearly in “Uncle Tom,” soon led to two kinds of people: those who accepted their suffering and those who wanted to enjoy life as much as they could. On plantations, where marriage didn’t mean much, being lazy was seen as okay, and owning things wasn’t really respected, this kind of religion made some people give up and others to act badly.

Many bad habits seen in Black communities today started back then. Homes were broken even near churches for both Black and white people. People stopped trying hard and became hopeless and lazy.

When the movement to end slavery began and some Black people became free, things started to change. We often forget how important free Black people were before the war because there weren’t many of them and they didn’t have much power in the country.

But their biggest impact was inside the Black community. They became leaders in how people lived and thought. Even though most free Black people were poor and unhappy in cities like Philadelphia, New York, and New Orleans, some stood out. These leaders cared deeply about ending slavery. Freedom was very real to them, not just a dream. Their religion became more serious, and they started hoping for revenge and justice soon. The idea of “The Coming of the Lord” became something they wanted to happen now, before death.

Stories from escaped slaves and talks about freedom inspired the millions of enslaved Black people to want freedom more than anything. Black poets began to sing songs about freedom, like:

“O Freedom, O Freedom, O Freedom over me!  
Before I’ll be a slave I’ll be buried in my grave,  
And go home to my Lord  
And be free.”

For fifty years, Black religion changed and became closely connected to the dream of ending slavery. What was once a small idea in the North and seen as dangerous in the South became a powerful belief for Black people everywhere.
