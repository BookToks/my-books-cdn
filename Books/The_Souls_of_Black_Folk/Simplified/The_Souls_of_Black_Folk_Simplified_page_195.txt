When he finally realized that he had paid five dollars to get into something he didn’t even understand, he stood still, surprised. “Be careful,” a quiet voice said behind him. “Don’t just hate the Black man because he’s in your way.” A girl looked up with a playful smile at her blond companion. 

The boy looked a little annoyed. “You won’t get how we are in the South,” he said, a bit impatient, like he was still arguing. “Even though people say otherwise, you don’t see the close friendships between white and Black people in the North like we have here every day. I remember my best friend as a kid was a little Black boy named after me, and no two friends were closer than us.” 

He stopped talking and turned red with embarrassment when he saw the Black man sitting right next to the fancy orchestra seats he had just bumped into. He hesitated, got pale with anger, called the usher, gave him his ticket with a few sharp words, and sat down slowly. The girl quickly changed the subject.

John didn’t notice any of this because he was lost in thought, watching everything around him. The hall was beautiful, with a soft smell in the air. People moved around wearing fancy clothes, and the low buzz of talking made it feel like a different world from his own, way more beautiful than anything he had ever seen. He felt like he was dreaming until the music started — loud and clear, the sound of Lohengrin’s swan.

The deep, endless sound touched every part of his body and made him feel connected. He closed his eyes and grabbed the arms of his chair, accidentally touching the lady’s arm. She moved away. A strong feeling grew inside him, wanting to rise up with the music and leave behind the dirty, hard life that trapped and hurt him. If only he could live in the fresh air where birds sang and sunsets weren’t stained with pain! Why was he chosen to be a slave and a joke? And if he was chosen, why, when a world like this was open to everyone?

Then the music changed, becoming bigger and stronger. He looked across the hall and wondered why the beautiful old gray-haired woman looked so tired and what the little man was whispering to her. He didn’t want to feel tired and bored like that because the music made him feel strong inside. If only he had a big, important job to do in life — something hard, really hard — but without needing to bow down or feel hurt and angry inside.
