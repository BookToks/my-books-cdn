The song called “My way’s cloudy” starts the chapter “The Meaning of Progress.” The ninth song is “Wrestlin’ Jacob, the day is a-breaking,” which is a hopeful fight song. The last important song is “Steal away,” which comes from “The Faith of the Fathers.” There are many other strong and typical Negro folk-songs, like some in chapters three, eight, and nine. Others could pick songs based on more scientific ways. There are also songs that seem a little more advanced than the oldest ones: for example, “Bright sparkles,” which is part of “The Black Belt”; the Easter song, “Dust, dust and ashes”; the sad song, “My mother’s took her flight and gone home”; and a beautiful melody from “The Passing of the First-Born” called “I hope my mother will be there in that beautiful world on high.” These show a third stage in the growth of slave songs. The first stage is African music, like “You may bury me in the East.” The second stage includes songs like “March on” and “Steal away.” The third stage mixes Negro music with music from the new country.

This mix is still clearly Negro music, and the way they blend is original, but it uses both Negro and white elements. You could even find a fourth stage where white American songs were clearly influenced by slave songs or used parts of Negro melodies, like “Swanee River” and “Old Black Joe.” At the same time, there were also many bad copies and imitations—like Negro “minstrel” songs, lots of “gospel” hymns, and some “coon” songs. These kinds of music can confuse someone new who wants to find the real Negro songs.

In these songs, the slaves talked to the world. Their message is often hidden and only partly clear. Words and music sometimes don’t match well, and new strange words about a confusing religion have replaced older feelings. Sometimes, a strange word from another language appears, like “Mighty Myo,” which means a river of death. More often, simple or silly words are put with very sweet music. There are not many purely fun songs because many were changed into hymns by changing the words, and because the fun songs were not often seen by outsiders, and the music was rarely recorded.
