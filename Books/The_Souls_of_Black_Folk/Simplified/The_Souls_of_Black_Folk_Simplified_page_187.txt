Bishop Onderdonk quickly read the letter and frowned. Luckily, he already knew what to think about it. He relaxed a bit and looked at Crummell. Then he said slowly and seriously, “I will accept you into this diocese only if no Black priest can sit in my church meetings, and no Black church can ask to be represented there.”

I sometimes imagine the scene: the thin Black man nervously adjusting his hat in front of the big Bishop Onderdonk. His worn coat hangs against the dark wooden bookcases filled with serious books like “Lives of the Martyrs” and “The Whole Duty of Man.” I picture the Black man’s wide eyes looking past the Bishop’s fancy clothes to the glass doors of a cabinet shining in the sunlight. A small blue fly is trying to get through a big keyhole. It walks up, looks inside surprised, rubs its feelers thoughtfully, tries to go deeper, but it seems endless, so the fly pulls back. The Black priest wonders if the fly is facing its own tough moment and if it will jump in—but then the fly spreads its tiny wings and happily flies across, leaving the priest feeling stuck and alone.

Then the full weight of what he faced hit him. The rich walls seemed to disappear, and all he saw was the cold, rough land stretching out before him, split by a giant rocky ridge—on one side, the Valley of Humiliation; on the other, the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

I don’t know which valley is darker—no, I don’t. But I do know this: in the Valley of Humiliation today stand millions of dark-skinned men who would gladly “...bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s insults, The pain of unreturned love, the delays of justice, The rudeness of officials, and the insults That patient goodness receives from the unworthy,”* and even more would they bear if they believed it was a true sacrifice and not something less. This thought filled that lonely Black man’s heart. The Bishop cleared his throat, maybe trying to say something, but then, realizing there was nothing to say, he said nothing and just tapped his foot impatiently.
