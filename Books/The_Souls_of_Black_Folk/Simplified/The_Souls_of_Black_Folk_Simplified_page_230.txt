But even with all the hardships, black people didn’t lose their pride, honesty, and dreams. A strong group of them kept going, working hard, showing their skills and good character. This group is special because it proves how capable black people are and what they can achieve.

Do people in America ever think about the fact that there are a million well-educated black men here? These men own homes, their women are respected, and they have important jobs. By any standard, they represent the best of modern culture. Is it fair or right to ignore these facts, to look down on their dreams, or to try to push them back into the crowd from which they worked so hard to rise?

Can the whole black community rise faster than by following the example of these talented and strong leaders? Has any nation ever become civilized from the bottom up? No, culture always spreads from the top down. The “Talented Tenth” lifts up those who can be saved. This is how humanity has always progressed. Two big mistakes have slowed progress: thinking only a few can rise, or trying to bring down those who have risen.

So how should leaders be trained and how can those who have risen be supported? There’s only one answer: The best and smartest young people must go to college. We don’t need to argue about what they should learn—every group needs its own special lessons. But a university is the best way to pass on knowledge and culture, by teaching sharp minds and good hearts. No other school, not even trade or industrial schools, can do this as well.

Not everyone can go to college, but some must. Every group or nation needs a “yeast,” a small group of talented people trained in places where they aren’t too busy just trying to survive to have bigger goals or dreams beyond money.
