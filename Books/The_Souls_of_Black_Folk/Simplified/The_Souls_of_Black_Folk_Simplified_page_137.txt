One of them still lives there—a short, stocky man with a dull brown face full of wrinkles and gray-white curly hair. The crops? He said they were just okay, nothing special. Is he doing well? No—he’s not doing well at all. A man named Smith from Albany “furnishes” him, and his rent is eight hundred pounds of cotton. He can’t make any money that way. Why didn’t he buy land?

He laughed and said, “It takes money to buy land,” then turned away. Free! The saddest thing in all the black ruins from the war, with broken dreams of the rich and poor, was the black freedman who stopped working because the world said he was free. What did that kind of freedom even mean?

No money, no land, not even enough food, and not even the clothes on his back. Free! Before the war, the old master gave his workers bacon and meal once or twice a month. After the first excitement of freedom faded and the freedman realized how helpless he was, he came back to work with his hoe. The old master still gave out bacon and meal. The way they worked was different on paper, but in real life, the slave became more like a tenant who shared the crop, but really was just a worker with no steady pay.

Still, cotton prices dropped, and landlords slowly left their plantations. Then the merchants took over. The merchant in the Black Belt is a strange mix—part banker, part landlord, part boss. His store used to be at the crossroads where the village met weekly, but now it’s in town. The tenant follows him there. The merchant has everything—clothes, shoes, coffee, sugar, pork, meal, canned and dried food, wagons, plows, seed, and fertilizer. If he doesn’t have something, he can order it from another store nearby.

Here comes the tenant, Sam Scott. After making a deal with a landlord’s agent to rent forty acres, he nervously waits for the merchant to finish chatting with Colonel Sanders. Then the merchant asks, “Well, Sam, what do you want?” Sam wants the merchant to “furnish” him—meaning to give him food, clothes, seed, and tools for the year until his crop is grown and sold.
