It's easy now to see that the man who lost his home, money, and family all at once, and watched his land being controlled by “mules and Black people,” actually ended up better off when slavery ended. It’s also not hard to tell the young freed slave, who was treated badly and saw his father hurt and his mother abused, that the kind and gentle people will inherit the earth. Most of all, it’s very easy to blame the Freedmen’s Bureau for all the problems of that time and say it was a total failure.

But this is easy to say, not fair or smart. Someone made mistakes, but those happened long before Oliver Howard was even born. There was wrong violence and careless neglect, but without some kind of control, things would have been much worse.

If the control had come from Black people themselves, they would have been put back into slavery in all but name. Since the control came from outside, even though the people and methods were not perfect, the work they did was still worth praising.

This was the start of Freedom and the work of the Freedmen’s Bureau. In short, for about fifteen million dollars, plus money spent before 1865 and help from kind groups, the Bureau started a system of paid work, helped Black people become landowners, made sure freed slaves were treated fairly in court, and created free public schools in the South. But it failed to build good relationships between former slave owners and freed people, sometimes acted like it was controlling instead of helping, which made people less independent, and didn’t give much land to freed slaves like it promised. Its successes came from hard work, help from kind people, and Black people’s own determination. Its failures came from bad local workers, how hard the job was, and the government ignoring it.

Because it had so much power, responsibility, money, and was always visible, it was often attacked. In 1870, Congress, led by Fernando Wood, investigated it closely. In 1872, its records and some work were taken away from Howard without much respect and given to the Secretary of War Belknap.
