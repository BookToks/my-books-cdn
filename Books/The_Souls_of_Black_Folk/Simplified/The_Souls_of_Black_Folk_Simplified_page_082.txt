Send out your spirits!

The immortal, the pure,  
Those who don’t feel, those who don’t cry!

Don’t choose the gentle girl,  
Nor the soft-hearted shepherdess!

Schiller.* Once, I was a teacher in the hills of Tennessee, where the wide, dark valley of the Mississippi starts to rise and meet the Allegheny Mountains. Back then, I was a student at Fisk, and all Fisk men believed that Tennessee—beyond the Veil—belonged only to them. During vacation, they went out in strong groups to meet the county school leaders. Young and happy, I went too, and I will never forget that summer, seventeen years ago.

First, there was a Teachers’ Institute at the county seat. Important guests invited by the superintendent taught the teachers about fractions, spelling, and other tricky subjects—white teachers in the morning, Black teachers at night. Sometimes there was a picnic or a supper, and the hard world felt softer with laughter and songs. I remember how—but I’m getting off track.

One day, all the teachers left the Institute and started looking for schools. I heard from others (because my mom was scared of guns) that hunting ducks, bears, and people is very exciting. But I’m sure anyone who hasn’t hunted for a country school has a lot to learn about the fun of the chase.
