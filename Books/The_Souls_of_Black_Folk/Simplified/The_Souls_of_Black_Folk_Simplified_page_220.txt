What will the role of this race be in the future? Clearly, some of the big races today—especially the Black race—haven’t yet shared all the important ideas and culture they can offer to the world.

I won’t say the Black race has given nothing to the world because scientists still debate how much Egyptian civilization was Black in origin. Even if it wasn’t completely Black, it was closely connected. Still, the full message of the entire Black race hasn’t been shared yet. The same goes for the yellow race, which hasn’t finished sharing its ideas, and the powerful Slavs, who are just starting to show their strength. So the question is: How will these messages be shared? How will these goals be reached?

The answer is simple: These groups need to grow and develop not as individuals, but as whole races. For Japanese talent, art, and spirit to fully grow, only Japanese people united by a big shared goal can bring it out. For Black talent, art, and spirit, only Black people united by a strong shared goal can fully develop the great message they have for the world. We can’t change history. We follow the same natural rules as other races. If Black people want to be a real part of world history—if a strong Black presence is to be part of civilization’s proud symbols—then it must be created by Black people themselves, with their own hands, minds, and hearts all working together in one joyful effort.

Because of this, the leading group of Black people—the 8 million Black Americans—must soon understand that if they want to be leaders of the Pan-Negro movement, they can’t just blend in and lose their identity with white Americans. If America is going to show for the first time that Black people can create great leaders like Toussaint, the Savior,* and have a rich culture, then their future is not to copy Anglo-Saxon culture, but to follow strong, original Black ideas.

Some might say this is impossible in America. They might say the only way to be safe is to lose their race identity by mixing with others. They might also say this would stop the fighting between the many races and the race prejudices people have fought against for so long.
