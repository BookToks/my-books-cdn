He had spent eighty years living in this same world of mine, hidden behind a kind of invisible barrier.

He was born when the Missouri Compromise was in place and was almost dying when the battles of Manila and El Caney happened. Those were exciting times to be alive, but dark times to remember and even darker times to face ahead. The black boy, who stopped to play with mud and marbles seventy years ago, saw confusing things as he looked out at the world. Slave ships still crossed the Atlantic Ocean, faint cries could be heard in the Southern air, and a scary, angry father told cruel stories to the boy’s young ears. From the low doorway, his mother quietly watched him play, and at night she searched for him, afraid that the shadows might take him away to the land of slaves.

His young mind thought hard and felt pain as he tried to understand life. In the middle of everything, one dark figure always stood alone—the bitter father with a hard face and a big, shapeless body. Hate slowly grew inside the child, sneaking into his laughter, fading into his play, and grabbing his dreams both day and night with rough force. The black boy asked the sky, the sun, and the flowers the question “Why?” but never got an answer. As he grew up, he didn’t love the world or its rough ways.

You might think it’s strange for a child to feel this way; but even today, thousands of dark-skinned children face the same feeling and feel its cold, scary hold. Maybe someday, someone will lift the invisible barrier for them—someone who will come kindly and cheerfully into their sad lives and wipe away their hate, just like Beriah Green did for Alexander Crummell. When the kind and brave man appeared, the darkness didn’t seem so bad. Beriah Green had a school in Oneida County, New York, with about twenty mischievous boys. “I’m going to bring a black boy here to learn,” said Beriah Green, as only a determined abolitionist would say. The boys laughed and said, “Oh really!”

“Yes,” his wife agreed; and Alexander came. Before this, the black boy had tried to find a school, traveling cold and hungry four hundred miles up to free New Hampshire, to a place called Canaan. But the farmers there, who cared a lot about religion, dragged the schoolhouse into the swamp using ninety oxen because they didn’t want the school. The black boy walked away.
