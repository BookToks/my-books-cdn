Du Bois’s way of thinking changed because of two terrible events in 1899. In April, he was shocked by the brutal lynching of Sam Hose, a farm worker accused of murder in Palmetto, Georgia, near Atlanta. Du Bois had written a careful letter against the lynching and was on his way to give it to a newspaper when he found out that Hose had been tortured, burned, and torn apart by a mob of over 2,000 people. This horrible event made Du Bois lose faith in using sociology, or the study of society, as a way to fight racism in the South.

Then, on May 24, Du Bois’s baby son Burghardt died after being sick for a short time. These two tragedies deeply affected how Du Bois saw his work. He said that after this, two things bothered him: first, it was impossible to stay calm and scientific while Black people were being lynched, killed, and starved; and second, there wasn’t much interest in the kind of scientific work he was doing, even though he had expected people to want it.

In his book The Souls of Black Folk, these events show up as a repeated criticism of a certain kind of sociology. The first chapter calls this the work of the “cold statistician.” The strongest criticism is in Chapter 8, called “Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece,” where he makes fun of the “car-window sociologist” — someone who tries to understand the South by only spending a few hours on a quick trip.

Instead, Du Bois says we need a method called “intimate contact.” This means slowly and carefully studying people face-to-face to understand the complicated parts of human life. It’s not enough to make broad guesses about social groups from far away. He explains that people don’t study the lives of Black Americans honestly or carefully today because it’s easier to just assume they already know everything. Sometimes people don’t want their ideas changed by real facts. But we actually know very little about millions of Black people — their daily lives, hopes, happiness, sadness, real problems, and why some commit crimes. The only way to truly learn about them is by close contact with the people themselves, not by making big generalizations about millions of different individuals who live in different times and places and have different backgrounds and cultures.
