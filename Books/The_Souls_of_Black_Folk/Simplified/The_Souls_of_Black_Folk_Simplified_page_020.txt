The idea of the ‘Talented Tenth’ was very important to Du Bois. This means he believed that the smartest and most skilled black people should lead the way. This made sense because, at that time, black people were often separated from white people and didn’t have many professionals like teachers, lawyers, or doctors to help their communities. Without these leaders, black people would struggle against unfair treatment from white people in power.

But Du Bois’s idea also had a problem. He believed that only a small group of talented people could help the whole race, and this sounded kind of elitist, which means thinking some people are better than others. Du Bois himself noticed this was a risky way of thinking. He asked if any country ever became civilized from the bottom up, and said it always happens from the top down. He thought the best people should lift up those who are worth saving.

In an earlier article, he said that a rising race must be like an aristocracy, where the good don’t mix with the bad, and even the best don’t mix with those who are less good. This sounds harsh, but it shows how much he believed in social ranks. In his book The Souls of Black Folk, he also made some strict comments about black people, like talking about ‘criminality’ and ‘sexual impurity.’ For example, he said that some black youth were meant to learn, and some were meant to do manual work. 

Later, in a speech from 1948, Du Bois gave a powerful criticism of his own idea about the Talented Tenth. He said that when he started working, he realized that training a group of talented people might just create selfish leaders who only cared about their own freedom and enjoyment. These leaders might not really care about the struggles of most black people or other groups. This showed that Du Bois understood the limits of his idea and that leadership should care about everyone, not just themselves.
