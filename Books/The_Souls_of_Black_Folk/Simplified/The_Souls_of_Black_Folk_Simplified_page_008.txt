The book is made up of fourteen pieces, with an introduction and a conclusion. It quickly became very important in American politics, surprising people like fireworks going off in a quiet place.

It made the author, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, famous around the world. He was a 35-year-old African American professor at Atlanta University who wanted to solve what people then called the ‘Negro problem’. The book mixes many styles like autobiography, history, politics, sociology, stories about people, and even fiction.

This book greatly influenced all African American writing that came after it. A famous critic, Arnold Rampersad, said that if all a country’s literature starts from one book, then Afro-American creative writing started from Du Bois’s book, The Souls of Black Folk. You can see its style and bold ideas in later novels like James Weldon Johnson’s The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man, Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, and Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon.

Du Bois’s work is also very important in African American non-fiction and studies about race, history, and politics. Ten years after the book came out, another black thinker, William H. Ferris, called The Souls of Black Folk “the political Bible of the negro race.” It is one of the rare books that marks the start of its time period, which Du Bois called the “dawning of the Twentieth Century.”
