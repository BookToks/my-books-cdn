Behind this common and honest opinion, dishonesty and cheating by uneducated workers have a good chance to hide.

Also, the fact that many black people come from a history of slavery and hard work without fair pay hasn’t made them more skilled or patient. This isn’t just about black people; it’s true for many groups in history who have been treated badly. This is the situation for most black people in the Black Belt today, and they are thinking about it. Crime and dangerous ideas about society are natural results of this thinking. I remember seeing a ragged black man sitting on a log, carving a stick without purpose. He quietly told me, “White man sits all year; black man works day and night to grow crops; black man barely gets bread and meat; white man just sits and gets everything. It’s wrong.” So, what do the better-off black people do to improve their lives?

They do one of two things: if they can, they buy land; if not, they move to the city. Long ago, it was hard for peasants to escape to freedom in towns, and today it’s still hard for county workers to do the same. In many parts of the Gulf States, especially Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas, black people on plantations in rural areas are still forced to work with little or no pay.

This is especially true in places where farmers are poor and uneducated white people, and black workers don’t have access to schools or contact with others who are making progress. If a worker tries to run away, the sheriff, chosen by white voters, usually catches him and sends him back without asking questions. If he escapes to another county, they can accuse him of small theft to bring him back. Even if someone insists on a trial, neighbors usually make sure he is found guilty, and then the owner can buy back the labor he needs. This kind of system doesn’t happen in more developed parts of the South or near big towns and cities. But in remote areas without telegraphs or newspapers, the spirit of the Thirteenth Amendment that ended slavery is sadly ignored. This shows the lowest level of economic life for black farmers, and to understand how black landowners rose up, we have to look at their progress from this modern form of slavery.
