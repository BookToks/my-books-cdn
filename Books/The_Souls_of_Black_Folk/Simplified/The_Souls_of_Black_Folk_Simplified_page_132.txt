The war caused a big money problem. In 1860, farms were worth five and a half million dollars, but by 1870, they were worth less than two million. At the same time, Texas started growing a lot of cotton, which made cotton prices drop from about fourteen cents a pound in 1860 to just four cents in 1898.

This money trouble put a lot of cotton farmers into debt. If the owners had it bad, think about how the workers felt.

The plantations in Dougherty County during slavery were not as fancy as those in Virginia. The Big House was smaller, usually only one story, and it sat close to the slave cabins.

Sometimes the cabins spread out on both sides like wings; other times they were only on one side, making a double row or lining the road that led to the plantation. Even today, these cabins look a lot like they did during slavery. Some people still live in the same old cabins, others live in cabins rebuilt on the same spots. These cabins are scattered in small groups around the land, usually near a run-down Big House where the main tenant or agent lives. The homes are mostly the same as before. In 1898, outside the town of Albany, there were about fifteen hundred Black families. Only one family had a house with seven rooms, and only fourteen families had five or more rooms. Most lived in homes with one or two rooms.

The size and style of homes tell us a lot about people’s lives. When we look closer at these Black homes, we see many problems. All over the land, there are one-room cabins. Sometimes they stand near the Big House, sometimes facing the dusty road, or sitting quietly in the green cotton fields. These cabins are usually old and plain, made with rough boards, and they don’t have plaster or ceilings.

They get light and air from just one door and a small square hole in the wall with a wooden shutter. There’s no glass, porch, or decoration outside.
