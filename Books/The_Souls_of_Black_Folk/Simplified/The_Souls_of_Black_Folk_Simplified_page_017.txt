In the second sentence of the ‘Forethought,’ Du Bois speaks in a strong and serious way to the ‘Southern Gentlemen’ in Chapter VI, ‘Of the Training of Black Men.’ He says that many Black people clearly see how unfair their situation is and how wrong the actions of white people are. Even if white people criticize Black people, the Black people’s responses, though not always perfectly logical, have important truths that can’t be ignored.

Most of the time, Du Bois uses this style to make readers face the real lives of Black people in the South. He often invites readers to join him on a journey ‘within the Veil’ to see the truth, especially in the middle chapters of the book. One famous example is near the start of Chapter VII, ‘Of the Black Belt,’ where Du Bois says: If you want to come with me, you have to get on the ‘Jim Crow Car.’ There are already four white men and a little white girl with her nurse inside. Usually, races mix in that car, but the white car is only for white people. This car isn’t as nice as the others, but it’s still clean and comfortable. The real discomfort is felt by the four Black men and me.

With parts like this, The Souls of Black Folk makes readers ‘fellow travelers’ to help them change their deep, automatic ideas about race. It forces them to see Black life through Black eyes.

This kind of moral and historical learning for the reader happens alongside Du Bois’s work to educate Black people. It also shows how he thought we should study the ‘Negro problem.’ In the late 1890s, Du Bois focused on studying race in a careful, scientific way. This started with his work The Philadelphia Negro and grew into a big project with the Atlanta University Studies. Later, he said that the ‘Negro problem’ was something that needed serious research and understanding. People were thinking the wrong way about race because they didn’t have enough knowledge. The biggest problem was ignorance, and the solution was learning based on careful research.
