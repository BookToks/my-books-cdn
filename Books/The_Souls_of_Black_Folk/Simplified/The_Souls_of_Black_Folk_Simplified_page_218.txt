So, what is a race? It’s a big group of people who usually share the same family background, language, history, traditions, and feelings. They are working together, sometimes by choice and sometimes not, to reach certain life goals they believe in.

Looking at real history, it’s clear that the idea of race, the spirit of race, and the goals of race have been everywhere and very important for human progress. People like us, who grew up with ideas about individual freedom and free markets, don’t always want to admit this obvious fact. We think about famous leaders like Pharaohs, Caesars, and Napoleons and forget the big groups of people they came from. Sometimes, Americans think that because the U.S. is a mix of many peoples, we have changed everything and don’t need the old ideas about race to make progress. But this idea, especially popular among Black people, can’t be proven by a careful look at history.

Today, there are eight clearly different races in the world, based on what history tells us. These are: the Slavs from eastern Europe; the Teutons from central Europe; the English from Great Britain and America; the Romance nations from southern and western Europe; the Negroes from Africa and America; the Semitic people from western Asia and northern Africa; the Hindoos from central Asia; and the Mongolians from eastern Asia. There are also smaller groups like American Indians, Eskimos, and South Sea Islanders.

Each big race includes many smaller groups. For example, the Slavs include Czechs, Magyars, Poles, and Russians. The Teutons include Germans, Scandinavians, and Dutch. The English group includes Scots, Irish, and Americans. The Romance nations include French, Italians, Sicilians, and Spaniards. The term Negro is a bit unclear and includes mixed-race people in America and different groups in Africa like Egyptians, Bantus, and Bushmen. The Hindoos cover many different nations, while the big Mongolian group includes Chinese, Tartars, Koreans, and Japanese.

So, what really makes these nations different? Is it their blood, skin color, or skull shape? Physical differences do matter a lot, and with some exceptions, these eight big races today generally match physical traits. The English and Teutons are white; the Mongolians are yellow; and the Negroes are black.
