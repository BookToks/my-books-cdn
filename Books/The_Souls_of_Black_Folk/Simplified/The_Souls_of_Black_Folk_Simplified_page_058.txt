With just one signature, a government was created for millions of Black men—men who had been kept powerless by a harsh system of slavery for hundreds of years. Suddenly, during a time of war and strong emotions, they were given new rights. This happened while the people who used to own them were angry and hurt. Anyone would have been nervous about taking on such a huge job, with big responsibilities, unclear rules, and little money. Probably only a soldier would have accepted the challenge quickly, and in fact, only a soldier could, since Congress didn’t approve money for salaries or expenses.

Less than a month after the leader who freed the slaves died, his replacement gave Major-General Oliver O. Howard the job of running the new Freedmen’s Bureau. Howard was from Maine and only 35 years old. He had marched with Sherman during the war, fought well at Gettysburg, and recently led the Department of Tennessee. He was honest and believed in people, but wasn’t very good at business or details. He had seen a lot of the problems he needed to fix up close. People say that the Freedmen’s Bureau was one of the most important steps in history for political and social progress.

On May 12, 1865, Howard was officially given the job. He started working right away on May 15 and began looking at the situation. What he saw was a big mess: small groups acting like dictators, experiments in sharing everything, slavery, forced labor, shady business deals, organized help, and random charity—all mixed together. Everything was happening under the cover of helping freed slaves, but it was also full of war’s chaos and the anger and silence of upset people.

On May 19, the new government—because that’s what it really was—wrote its rules. Commissioners were to be chosen for each Southern state that had left the Union. These commissioners would handle everything about refugees and freed slaves. No help or food could be given without their approval. The Bureau invited kind organizations to keep helping and said that all commissioners should work to create fair paid jobs and start schools.
