Life steps on life, and heart touches heart;  
We stand too close in church and market  
To keep a dream or a grave apart.  

The world has always seen different races meet, and this will happen even more in the new century. Today, European civilization is coming into contact with many less developed peoples around the world.  

In the past, this contact didn’t always end well. There were wars, killings, slavery, destruction, and bad behavior when people tried to bring their ideas and religion to new places.  

It’s not enough to say this was all right or meant to happen, like a battle between good and evil or strong and weak. It would be easier if we could believe that, but many harsh facts don’t fit that simple story.  

We understand there are many small differences between races and changes in society that are hard to measure, which explain some of history and how people develop.  

But even with that, these ideas don’t fully explain or excuse how often force and trickery have won over weakness and innocence.
