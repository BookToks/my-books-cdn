The Black race, like all races, will be saved by its best and smartest people.

The main education problem for Black people is about the Talented Tenth. This means developing the best 10% of the race so they can lead the rest away from bad influences and failure, both in their own race and others. Teaching people is hard and needs experts, but the goal needs a clear vision. If schools only focus on making money, they will create money-makers but not real leaders. If they only teach technical skills, they will make workers but not true men. Real men come from schools that teach not just skills, but also intelligence, understanding, and knowledge about the world and how people relate to it. This kind of higher education is the base of a good life. On this base, people can learn how to earn money and work quickly, without confusing those things with the real purpose of life.

If this is true—and no one can deny it—then I have three jobs: first, to show that the Talented Tenth of Black Americans have been good leaders; second, to explain how these men can be educated and grown; and third, to show how they connect to the Black race’s problems.

You don’t understand us because you don’t really know us. From the start, the educated and smart Black people have led and helped the rest. The only things that stopped them were slavery and racism. Slavery was like a system that kept the weak alive and stopped natural leaders from rising. So, Black leaders have always tried to get rid of slavery so that the strongest and best could lead the race forward.
