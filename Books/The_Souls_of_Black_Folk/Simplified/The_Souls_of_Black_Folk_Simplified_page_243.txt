In the fall of 1904, Du Bois was asked to write a short review of his own work for an important magazine called The Independent. He honestly talked about what he had done, especially how well his book fit together and how many different ideas it included.

When someone is born with a strong cause, they often see things in a narrow way but also have a clear vision within that view. My book shows both the problems and strengths of this situation. Because I am Black, I don’t see things as broadly as people from other backgrounds do. At the same time, I feel very strongly about my ideas, which can both attract and push away people. Sometimes my words make things clearer, and sometimes they confuse people.

The Souls of Black Folk is made up of fourteen essays written at different times and for different reasons over seven years. Because of this, there is a lot of variety in the book. It includes history, personal stories, descriptions of people and places, debates, criticism, some statistics, and some storytelling. This causes sudden changes in style, tone, and point of view, and it can make the book feel unfinished or incomplete.

But the book does have a kind of unity. It’s not just about one big topic, but each essay shares a personal and honest feeling. I tried to write from inside my experience, showing the world as we who live in it see it. By giving up the usual objective style of most authors, I lost some authority but made the writing more vivid. I believe readers will want to judge my ideas, but they will also get a sense of how I see the world.

That doesn’t mean the style and writing always make the meaning clear. Most readers get the main message, but around it there is some confusion and hidden meaning that makes some people impatient. I’m not sure if this is my fault or just the nature of what I’m trying to say. It’s very hard to put the deeper feelings of people into words.
