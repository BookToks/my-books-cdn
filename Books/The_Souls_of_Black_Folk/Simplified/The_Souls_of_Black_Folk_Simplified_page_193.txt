Then the Dean spoke slowly and clearly, reminding him about being late, careless, doing bad work, and making noise. The boy hung his head, feeling confused. Then the Dean quickly said, “But you won’t tell your mom and sister, right? You won’t write to your mom? Because if you don’t, I’ll go into the city, work hard, and come back next term to show you I can do better.” The Dean promised he wouldn’t tell, and John picked up his small trunk. He didn’t say a word or look at the boys who were laughing, and he walked down Carlisle Street to the big city, looking serious.

Maybe we imagined it, but it seemed like the serious look on his young face never went away after that afternoon. When he came back, he worked with all his strength. It was tough because things didn’t come easy to him. He didn’t have many memories or lessons to help him now, but the world he wanted was something he had to build himself, slowly and with hard work. As he started to see the results of his work, he sat quietly, lost in thought, or walked alone around the green campus, looking beyond the world of people into the world of ideas.

Sometimes his thoughts confused him a lot. He couldn’t understand why a circle wasn’t a square, and one night he worked on it with numbers all the way to fifty-six decimal places—he would have gone further if the matron hadn’t told him to turn off the lights. He caught bad colds lying on his back outside at night, trying to figure out the solar system. He doubted the reasons for the Fall of Rome and thought the Germans were probably thieves and troublemakers, even though his textbooks said otherwise. He spent a long time thinking about every new Greek word, wondering why it meant what it did and how it felt to think in Greek. So he thought and puzzled through things by himself—getting stuck where others moved on happily, and working hard through problems where others gave up.

That’s how he grew stronger in body and mind. His clothes seemed to grow and fit better too; his coat sleeves got longer, cuffs showed up, and his collars got cleaner. Sometimes his boots even shined, and he started to walk with more confidence. We who saw him every day noticed a new seriousness in his eyes and began to expect something great from this slow, steady boy.
