So, he finished prep school and went to college. We who watched him saw him change a lot over the next four years. The tall, serious guy who bowed to us on graduation day was almost a different person. He left his strange way of thinking behind and came back to a world full of movement and people.

Now, for the first time, he really looked around and wondered why he hadn’t noticed so much before. He slowly started to feel the “Veil” between him and the white world. He saw how unfair things were—things that didn’t feel unfair when he was a kid. He noticed rules and insults that used to seem normal or funny. Now, he got mad when people didn’t call him “Mister,” got angry about the “Jim Crow” train cars, and hated the color barriers that kept him and his people trapped. His speech got a little sarcastic, and he felt a quiet bitterness in life. He spent long hours thinking and planning how to get around these problems.

Every day, he felt himself shrinking from the small, limited life of his hometown. Still, he always planned to go back to Altamaha and work there. But as the day got closer, he felt a strange fear. Even the day after graduation, he jumped at the chance when the Dean offered to send him North with the singing group for the summer.

“A little break before the big step,” he told himself quietly.

One bright September afternoon, the streets of New York were full of busy people. Watching them, John thought of the sea—always moving but never the same. He looked at their nice clothes, how they held their hands, the shape of their hats, and the fast carriages. Then, leaning back with a sigh, he said, “This is the World.” Suddenly, he wanted to see where the world was going, since many rich and bright people seemed to be rushing in one direction.

When a tall, light-haired young man and a chatty woman walked by, John stood up, a bit unsure, and followed them. They went up the street, past stores and fancy shops, across a big square, until they joined a crowd entering a huge building.

He was pushed toward the ticket office with the others and felt in his pocket for the new five-dollar bill he had saved. There wasn’t really time to think, so he bravely took it out, handed it to the busy clerk, and got a ticket—no change given.
