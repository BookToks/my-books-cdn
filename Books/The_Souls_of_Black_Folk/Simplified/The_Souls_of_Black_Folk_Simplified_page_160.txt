Big changes have been happening all around, both good and bad. People have been trying to make life better, but there have also been times of breaking apart and sadness. Life has been full of ups and downs, mixing happiness and pain, with lots of excitement and problems.

At the center of all this is the millions of black freedmen and their children, whose future is closely tied to the country’s future. But if someone just visits the South, they might not see much of this at first. They’ll notice more black faces as they travel, but otherwise, everything seems calm and peaceful, like any other place. 

When it comes to the big issue—the "Negro problem"—people don’t talk about it much. Newspapers rarely mention it, and when they do, it sounds distant and academic. Most people seem to ignore the black part of the country, making visitors wonder if there’s really a problem at all. But if they stay longer, they start to notice. Maybe it hits them all at once with strong feelings, or maybe it comes slowly as they see things they missed before.

They begin to see the color line—the clear division between black and white people. Sometimes they see crowds of both races together. Other times, they notice no black faces at all. Or they might end up in a place where almost everyone is black, and feel like an outsider. They realize that the world around them is split into two separate groups. These groups mix in everyday life, but then stay apart again. This separation happens quietly, and if anyone tries to cross the line, like a black man and a white woman talking on a street in Atlanta, the law quickly steps in.

If you look closely, you’ll see that even though black and white people live close to each other and meet every day, their ways of thinking and feeling don’t really connect. They don’t share true understanding or sympathy with each other.
