This is real training, and at first, the best young men who loved freedom got this training. After the war, from Northern colleges came Ware, Cravath, Chase, Andrews, Bumstead, and Spence. They worked to build knowledge and civilization in the Black South.

Where should they have started? At the very bottom, of course, says the mole who lives underground. Yes, truly at the bottom, deep down where the roots of justice grow in the soil of truth. That’s exactly where they began. They started colleges, then normal schools grew from those colleges, and teachers came from the normal schools. Those teachers then taught in public schools. About 2,000 college-trained men taught 50,000 others about morals and manners. Those 50,000 taught 9 million people basic skills like reading and saving money. Today, those 9 million people own $300 million in property. It was an amazing success, the greatest peaceful fight of the 19th century. But now, some people laugh at it and say it was a mistake. They say the best way to start education is to gather children, give them spelling books and tools, and then maybe find teachers. Some even say work and life are not connected.

Was the work of these college founders successful? Did it last? Did the college graduates with their ideas about life really live well? Did they help others become better? Let’s look. Ignoring schools that haven’t graduated students, there are now thirty-four schools in the US that offer more than high school education to Black students.

Three of these schools started in border states before the war. Thirteen were created by the Freedmen’s Bureau from 1864 to 1869. Nine were set up by churches between 1870 and 1880. Five were started by Black churches after 1881. Four are state schools supported by US agricultural funds. Usually, college programs are small parts of schools that also teach high school and lower grades. Six schools—Atlanta, Fisk, Howard, Shaw, Wilberforce, and Leland—are the most important Black colleges because of their work and number of students. Together, these schools have 750 Black college students. Compared to smaller New England colleges, these schools are about a year behind. For example, at Atlanta University, students finish three years of high school and then take a college course that lasts 136 weeks.
