Here’s the problem, and it’s a tricky one, I admit. Every Black person who thinks seriously about the situation of their people in America has, at some point, asked themselves: What am I really? Am I American or Black? Can I be both? Or should I try to stop being Black as soon as possible and just be American? If I try to succeed as a Black person, am I just keeping alive the divide that separates Black and White America? Should I try to forget everything Black about me to be American? Does having Black blood mean I have to be proud of my race more than someone with German, Irish, or Italian blood?

This constant questioning and doubt is making this time confusing for Black Americans. Because of it, working together as a race is hard, people avoid their responsibilities to the race, Black businesses and projects struggle, and the best and brightest Black people don’t come together to help their community. Instead, they step back and let dishonest people take advantage of race pride for their own selfish reasons.

Is this right? Does it make sense? Is it a smart idea? Do we have a special mission or role as Black people in America? Or is giving up our Black identity the best we can hope for?

If we think about what race prejudice really is, it’s just the tension between different groups of people. It’s the differences in goals, feelings, and ideas between races. If these differences affect things like land, laws, language, or religion, then it’s clear these groups can’t live together without serious conflict. But if they agree on laws, language, and religion, and have a fair way to live economically, then there’s no reason why different races can’t live in the same country and even the same neighborhood, each growing their own culture and working together for their people’s goals, maybe even better than if they lived separately.

This, to me, is the answer to the confusing question many of us face. We are Americans, not just by birth and citizenship, but because we share political ideas, language, and religion. Beyond that, our American identity stops. At that point, we are Black people, part of a huge historic race that has been half asleep in Africa for a long time. We are the first signs of a new Black future that will change the mostly White world we live in now.
