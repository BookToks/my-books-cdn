He put his arm around her and let her cry on his shoulder.  

They stood together for a long time, looking out over the gray, restless water.  

“John,” she said, “does learning a lot make everyone unhappy?” He stopped and smiled. “I’m afraid it does,” he said.  

“And, John, are you glad you studied?” “Yes,” he answered slowly but definitely.  

She watched the flickering lights on the sea and said thoughtfully, “I wish I was unhappy, and…” She put both arms around his neck, “I think I am, a little, John.”  

A few days later, John went to the Judge’s house to ask if he could teach at the Negro school. The Judge met him at the door, looked at him closely, and said sharply, “Go around to the kitchen door, John, and wait.”  

John sat on the kitchen steps, looking at the corn, feeling confused.  

What was happening to him? Every step he took seemed to upset someone. He had come to help his people, but already he had hurt them. He tried to teach at the church but had offended their feelings. He had trained himself to be polite to the Judge, but then he made a mistake by going through the front door. He meant well, but it was hard and strange to fit back into his old life. He couldn’t remember having any trouble before, when life was happy and easy.  

Maybe things were easier then. Just then, his sister came to the kitchen door and said the Judge was waiting for him.  

The Judge sat in the dining room with his morning mail and didn’t ask John to sit down. He got straight to the point.  

“You’ve come about the school, I guess. Well, John, I want to be honest with you. You know I’m a friend to your people. I’ve helped you and your family, and I would have done more if you hadn’t decided to leave. I like the colored people and understand their hopes. But you and I both know, John, that in this country, Black people have to stay below white people and can’t expect to be equal. In their place, your people can be honest and respectful; and I’ll do what I can to help them.”
