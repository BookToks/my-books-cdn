When Emancipation finally happened, freed slaves felt like it was a true miracle, almost like the Lord himself had come.

Their imagination was fired up more than ever by the sound of armies marching, the violence of battles, and the chaos of big social changes. They stood still and silent, unsure what to do. Wasn’t this God’s work? They were happy and confused, waiting for more amazing things to come until the country's backlash brought the problems we see today.

It’s hard to clearly explain the current tough time for Black religion. First, remember that Black people live close to a big modern country and share, even if not fully, the spirit of that nation. So, they are affected by the religious and moral ideas moving the United States today. But these ideas are overshadowed by the much bigger issue for them: their civil, political, and economic position. They constantly have to deal with the “Negro Problem” – it’s part of everything they do and how they see the world. 

On top of that, they face special challenges in their private lives—like the role of women, keeping families together, raising kids, building wealth, and stopping crime. All this causes a time of deep moral struggle, serious religious questioning, and mental confusion. Every Black American has to live a double life: as a Black person and as an American, pushed forward by the modern world but still caught in old ways. This creates a painful self-awareness, a kind of doubt about who they are that hurts their confidence.

The world inside and outside the “Veil of Color” is changing fast but not in the same way or speed. This makes people feel torn and confused inside. Living with double thoughts, double responsibilities, and two social classes leads to double meanings and conflicting ideas. It can push someone toward pretending to be something they’re not, or rebelling, being fake, or going too far.

In some of these confusing words and ideas, you can see the special moral problem that Black people face today, which is shaping and changing their religious life.
