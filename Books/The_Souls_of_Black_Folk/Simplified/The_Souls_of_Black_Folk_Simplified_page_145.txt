Arthur Young said, “Wherever a country is poor, it’s because metayers run things,” and “their lives are worse than day-laborers.” He was talking about Italy 100 years ago, but this could also describe Dougherty County today. Especially true is what he said about France before the Revolution: “Metayers are seen almost like servants, who can be kicked out whenever the landlords want, and have to do whatever the landlords say.” Half or more of the Black people in Dougherty County are living this hard way today.

A little better off are workers who get paid money for their work. Some get a house and a small garden, plus food and clothes on credit, and at the end of the year they get wages from $30 to $60. But they have to pay back for the supplies with interest. About 18% of people are like this, called semi-metayers. Another 22% are workers paid by the month or year. They usually pay for their own things or buy on credit from a store that hopes they will pay back. These workers usually make 35 to 50 cents a day during work season. Most are young and not married, some are women. When they get married, they often become metayers or sometimes renters.

Renters pay a fixed money amount to farm land and make up about 5% of families. Their main advantage is they can choose what crops to grow and have more responsibility because money changes hands. Some renters are not much better off than metayers, but mostly they are smarter and more responsible. These renters are the ones who usually become landowners later.

Because they are smarter, renters can get better deals on rent. Farms they rent are usually 40 to 100 acres and cost about $54 a year. The men who farm like this don’t stay renters for long. If they don’t do well, they become metayers again. But if they have good harvests, they can become landowners.

In 1870, the tax records for Dougherty show no Black people owning land.
