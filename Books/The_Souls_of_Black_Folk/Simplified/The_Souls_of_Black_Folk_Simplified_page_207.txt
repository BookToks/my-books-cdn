This was primitive African music; it may be seen in larger form in the strange chant which heralds “The Coming of John”: “You may bury me in the East, You may bury me in the West, But I’ll hear the trumpet sound in that morning,”* ––the voice of exile.
 
 Ten master songs, more or less, one may pluck from this forest of melody––songs of undoubted Negro origin and wide popular currency, and songs peculiarly characteristic of the slave. One of these I have just mentioned. Another whose strains begin this book is “Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.” When, struck with a sudden poverty, the United States refused to fulfil its promises of land to the freedmen, a brigadier-general went down to the Sea Islands to carry the news. An old woman on the outskirts of the throng began singing this song; all the mass joined with her, swaying. And the soldier wept.
 
 The third song is the cradle-song of death which all men know,–– “Swing low, sweet chariot,”––whose bars begin the life story of “Alexander Crummell.” Then there is the song of many waters, “Roll, Jordan, roll,” a mighty chorus with minor cadences. There were many songs of the fugitive like that which opens “The Wings of Atalanta,” and the more familiar “Been a-listening.” The seventh is the song of the End and the Beginning––“My Lord, what a mourning! when the stars begin to fall”; a strain of this is placed The Sorrow Songs 171 before “The Dawn of Freedom.
