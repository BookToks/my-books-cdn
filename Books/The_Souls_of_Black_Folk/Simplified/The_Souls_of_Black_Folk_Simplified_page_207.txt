This was early African music. You can hear it more clearly in the strange chant that announces “The Coming of John”: “You may bury me in the East, You may bury me in the West, But I’ll hear the trumpet sound in that morning.” This shows the feeling of being far from home.

There are about ten main songs you can find in this collection of melodies. These songs definitely come from Black culture and were popular among slaves. One of these songs I already mentioned. Another one, which starts this book, is “Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.” When the United States suddenly didn’t give promised land to freed slaves, a general went to tell people in the Sea Islands. An old woman began singing this song, and everyone joined in, moving together. The soldier even cried.

The third song is a lullaby about death that everyone knows, called “Swing low, sweet chariot.” Its tune begins the story of “Alexander Crummell.” Then there’s “Roll, Jordan, roll,” a powerful song with a deep, serious sound. There were many songs about escaping, like the one that starts “The Wings of Atalanta,” and the well-known “Been a-listening.” 

The seventh song talks about the End and the Beginning—“My Lord, what a mourning! when the stars begin to fall.” A part of this song is placed before “The Dawn of Freedom.”
