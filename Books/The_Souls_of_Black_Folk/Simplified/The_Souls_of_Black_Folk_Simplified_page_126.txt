The black men we met in this area were not happy. They didn’t have the fun and carefree attitude we usually think about when we imagine plantation workers. At best, they were polite but complained a little, or they seemed quiet and sad. Sometimes, their anger showed through quietly but strongly.

I remember one big man with red eyes we met by the road. He had worked on the same farm for 45 years, starting with nothing and still having nothing. He had sent four kids to regular school, and maybe if a new law hadn’t stopped him from keeping animals, he could have done better. But now, he was stuck in debt, disappointed, and bitter. He asked about a black boy in Albany who was said to have been shot by a policeman for talking too loud on the sidewalk. Then he said slowly, “If a white man touches me, he dies. I don’t brag about this or say it loud, especially not around kids, but I mean it. I’ve seen white men whip my father and mother in the cotton fields until they bled.” Then we moved on.

Next, we met Sears, who was very different. Was he happy? Well, yes. He laughed, tossed pebbles, and seemed to accept life as it was. He had worked here for twelve years and only owned a mule that was still mortgaged.

He had seven kids, but none had been to school this year because they couldn’t afford books or clothes, and the kids had to work instead.

Some of the kids were going to the fields now—three big boys riding mules and a strong girl with bare brown legs. Here, we saw some people who were lazy and ignorant, and others who were full of hate and anger. These were the two extreme sides of the problems faced by black people that day, and we didn’t know which was worse.

Sometimes, we met unique people who stood out. One old man came out of a newly cleared patch of land, carefully avoiding snakes. He had a thin face with deep lines and a brown skin tone. He had a strange but funny way about him, mixed with serious and sharp thoughts that were hard to understand. He said, “The other black folks were jealous of me on the other land, so me and my wife begged for this patch of woods, and I cleared it myself. I didn’t make anything for two years, but I think I have a crop now.”
