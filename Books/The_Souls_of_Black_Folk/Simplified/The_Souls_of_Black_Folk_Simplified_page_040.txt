This idea is important for you to understand because the big problem of the 20th century is the problem of race.

Please read my little book kindly. Study my words with me, forgive my mistakes, and look for the truth hidden inside.

I have tried to describe, in a rough way, the spiritual world where millions of Americans live and work. First, in two chapters, I explain what freedom after slavery meant to them and what happened afterward. In the third chapter, I talk about the slow rise of leaders and honestly criticize the main leader of his race today. Then, in two chapters, I quickly describe the two worlds separated by the Veil and talk about the main problem of preparing people for life. Going deeper, in two chapters I study the struggles of many black farmers, and in another, I explain the current relationship between the children of masters and servants.

Leaving the world of white people, I step inside the Veil, lifting it so you can see a little of its deep parts—the meaning of its religion, the pain of its people, and the fight of its greatest souls. I finish with a story told twice but rarely written down.

Some of these ideas have been shared before in other forms. I thank the publishers of The Atlantic Monthly, The World’s Work, The Dial, The New World, and the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science for letting me use them again here, changed and longer.

Before each chapter, there is a line from the Sorrow Songs—some echo of haunting music from the only American music that came from black souls in the dark past.
