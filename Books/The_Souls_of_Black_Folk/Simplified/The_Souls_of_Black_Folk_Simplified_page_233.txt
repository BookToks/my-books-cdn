Sometimes, people say that a Black college graduate works in low-paying jobs. But luckily, a big study from Atlanta shows what most college-educated Black people actually do for work. The study included almost 60% of all graduates.

This helps us understand what jobs most Black college graduates have. Out of 1,312 people, the jobs were:

Teachers: 53.4%  
Clergy (like preachers): 16.8%  
Doctors and similar jobs: 6.3%  
Students: 5.6%  
Lawyers: 4.7%  
Government workers: 4.0%  
Business people: 3.6%  
Farmers and skilled workers: 2.7%  
Editors, secretaries, and clerks: 2.4%  
Other jobs: 0.5%

More than half are teachers, about one-sixth are preachers, and another one-sixth are students and professionals. Over 6% work as farmers, skilled workers, or merchants, and 4% work for the government.

Hereâ€™s a closer look at some jobs:

Teachers include presidents and deans (19), music teachers (7), and professors, principals, and teachers (675), totaling 701.  
Clergy include a bishop (1), army chaplains (2), missionaries (9), presiding elders (12), and preachers (197), totaling 221.  
Doctors include medical doctors (76), pharmacists (4), and dentists (3), totaling 83.  
There were 74 students and 62 lawyers.
