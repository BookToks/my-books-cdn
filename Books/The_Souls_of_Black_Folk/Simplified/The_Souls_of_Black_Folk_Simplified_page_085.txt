Thenie always showed up early. She was a happy, not-so-pretty but kind girl who secretly used snuff and took care of her little brother who had bow legs. When her mom could let her go, ’Tildy came too. She was really pretty at night, with bright, star-like eyes and slim arms and legs. Her brother, though, was pretty plain-looking. Then there were the big boys—the strong Lawrences; the lazy Neills, who didn’t have a dad; Hickman, who had hunched shoulders; and the others.

They all sat there, almost thirty kids, on rough benches. Their skin color ranged from light cream to dark brown. Their little bare feet swung back and forth, their eyes were full of hope, sometimes with a cheeky sparkle, and they held tightly to Webster’s blue-back spelling book. I loved my school, and it was amazing how much the kids trusted their teacher. We read and spelled words together, wrote a bit, picked flowers, sang songs, and listened to stories about places beyond the hill. Sometimes the school would get really small when kids stopped coming, so I would go visit them.

I went to see Mun Eddings, who lived in two very messy rooms. I asked why little Lugene, whose bright red hair looked wild, hadn’t come all week, or why I hadn’t seen Mack and Ed with their usual torn clothes. Then the dad, who worked on Colonel Wheeler’s farm and shared the crops, told me they needed the boys to help out. The mom, who looked pretty when she was clean but was usually messy, said Lugene had to watch the baby. “But they’ll come back next week,” she promised. When the Lawrences stopped coming, I knew the grown-ups had again decided school wasn’t worth it. So I climbed the hill, got as far inside the cabin as I could, and explained Cicero’s “pro Archia Poeta” in the simplest English with examples they could relate to. Usually, I convinced them to send the kids back—for a little while.

On Friday nights, I often went home with some of the kids—sometimes to Doc Burke’s farm. Doc Burke was a tall, loud, skinny Black man who worked hard and was trying to buy seventy-five acres of land with hills and valleys where he lived. But people said he wouldn’t make it and that white folks would take all the land. His wife was a strong, impressive woman with yellowish skin and shiny hair. She didn’t wear a corset or shoes, and their kids were healthy and beautiful. They lived in a small cabin in a hollow on the farm, near a spring.

The front room had big, soft white beds that were kept very clean. There were some bad pictures on the walls and a worn-out table in the middle. In the tiny back kitchen, I was often invited to help myself to fried chicken, wheat biscuits, “meat,” corn bread, string beans, and berries.
