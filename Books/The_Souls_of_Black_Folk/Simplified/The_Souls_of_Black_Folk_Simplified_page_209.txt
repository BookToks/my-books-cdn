Most of the songs sound really sad. The ten main songs I talked about tell stories with both words and music about hard times, being forced away from home, fighting, and hiding. They reach out for some unknown power and wish for peace in the end.

The words we still have are interesting. If you look past the obvious stuff, they hide real poetry and meaning under usual religious ideas and meaningless excitement. Like many early people, the slaves felt very close to nature. Life was like a rough and rolling sea, like the brown ocean near the Sea Islands. The “Wilderness” was where God lived, and the “lonesome valley” was the path to life. To them, “Winter’ll soon be over” meant life and death in a tropical way.

The sudden loud storms in the South amazed and scared the Black people. Sometimes the thunder sounded sad, and other times it felt powerful: “My Lord calls me, He calls me by the thunder, The trumpet sounds it in my soul.” The long, hard work and being outside all the time is described in many songs. You can see the farmers working in the hot, wet fields, singing: “There’s no rain to wet you, There’s no sun to burn you, Oh, push along, believer, I want to go home.” The tired old man cries out three times: “O Lord, keep me from sinking down,” and he warns against the devil of doubt who says: “Jesus is dead and God’s gone away.”

Even so, there is a deep hunger in the soul, a restless feeling like a wild person, and the sad cry of someone who wanders. This sadness is shown in a simple phrase. Fear was always around the slaves and how they related to each other, so we only get small bits and pieces of their true feelings, along with powerful silences and things left unsaid.
