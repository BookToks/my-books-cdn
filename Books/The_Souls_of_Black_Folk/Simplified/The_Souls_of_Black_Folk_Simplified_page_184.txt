The 1800s were the first time people really started to feel for each other. It was the time when we began to see a special spark in others that made us realize, "Hey, they’re just like me." People from all walks of life—farmers, poor folks, rich people, and sometimes Black people—were seen as real, feeling humans. We were surprised and asked, "You too? Have you felt sadness and hopelessness? Have you really lived?"

We looked into their worlds and wondered, "How can we all come together as one?" At a small school in Oneida, some boys discovered that there was deep thought and feeling beneath dark skin, something they never knew before. 

For one lonely boy, this was a new beginning filled with understanding and hope. The scary feeling of Hate between him and the world became less strong. It didn’t go away completely, but it faded and stayed only at the edges. Through it, the boy saw the bright and beautiful side of life—the sunny path that seemed to connect earth and sky far away. 

He dreamed of life in a magical, amazing way. He stood tall, took a deep breath of fresh air, and heard strange noises beyond the forest. Far away, he saw a group of people calling out to him. He heard the painful noise of their chains and felt their suffering. Inside him grew a feeling of protest and a promise to fight for them. He prepared himself to face the world.

A voice and vision told him to become a priest and a leader to help free people from slavery. He saw a crowd moving toward him like a wild river. He reached out his hands eagerly, but then the feeling of Despair came over him.

The men he met weren’t bad people. The problem wasn’t about evil men. They were calm and kind bishops of the Church trying to do what was right. They said slowly, "This is natural and even good, but the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church cannot accept a Black student." When the boy kept coming back, they put their hands gently on his shoulders and said, "We know how you feel, but it’s just not possible yet. It’s too soon."
