Is this a small problem that doesn’t affect the main issue of how Black people grow in jobs and education?

Can we have lots of Black workers, craftsmen, and landowners in the South who, by law and what people think, have no say in making the rules they live and work by? The way industries work now depends on a free government where workers can demand respect and fair treatment. But can this happen in the South when half the workers have no voice in government and can’t protect themselves? Today, Black people in the South have almost no say about how much tax they pay or how the money is spent. They don’t get to decide who enforces the laws or how, or who makes the laws. It’s sad that at important times, Black people have to work really hard just to get lawmakers to listen to their side. Every day, Black people are starting to see laws and justice not as protection, but as things that hurt and humiliate them. Laws are made by people who don’t care about them; laws are enforced by people who don’t treat Black people with respect; and if a Black person breaks the law, they are often judged by people who would rather punish many innocent Black people than let one guilty person go free.

I’m not saying Black people don’t have problems or weaknesses. I also feel sorry for white Southerners trying to solve tough social problems. Sometimes, it’s okay—and even best—for a less developed group to be guided by stronger neighbors until they’re ready to stand on their own.

I’ve already said how much the freed Black people needed help with money and spirit. I agree that if the best white leaders in the South were in charge today, things might be better. But the point I keep making is that the best opinions in the South are not the ones in charge right now.
