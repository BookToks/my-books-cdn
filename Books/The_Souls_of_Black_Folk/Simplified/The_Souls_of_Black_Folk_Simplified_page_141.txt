Even in the better-organized country areas of the South, it’s hard for farm workers to move around freely because of rules against migration agents. The “Associated Press” recently reported that a young white man in Southern Georgia was arrested for trying to persuade workers to leave a turpentine farm. He worked for the “Atlantic Naval Supplies Company.” The problem is that employment agents have to pay a big fine—five hundred dollars for each county—if they try to recruit workers to go outside the state. Because of these laws, Black workers often don’t learn about job opportunities outside their local area.

There’s also an unwritten rule in small Southern towns and rural areas: any Black person who isn’t known by the community must have a white person vouch for them. This idea is like an old Roman custom where a freed slave needed a protector. Sometimes, this was helpful to Black people, especially when white families who once owned them helped guide them to do better in life. But other times, this rule meant entire communities refused to let Black people move freely or control their own lives. For example, a Black stranger in Baker County, Georgia, can be stopped on the road and questioned by any white person. If the stranger doesn’t give a good answer or acts too confident, they might be arrested or forced to leave right away.

So, in Southern country areas, whether by written laws or unwritten rules, there were systems that kept people tied down, stopped workers from moving, and put white people in control. Also, the chances of unfair treatment and illegal actions were much higher in the countryside than in cities. Most serious race conflicts in the last ten years happened because of fights between workers and employers in these rural places—like the Sam Hose incident. Because of this situation, two things happened: first, the creation of the Black Belt, and second, the migration of Black people to towns. The Black Belt wasn’t just about finding better weather for farming; it was mostly about Black people coming together to protect each other and create a peaceful place where they could improve their lives.
