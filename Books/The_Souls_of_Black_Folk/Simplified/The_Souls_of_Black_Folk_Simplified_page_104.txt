Today, people ask about education more than ever because of some worrying signs in how schools are changing. The way things are going, influenced by the history of slavery and the wild ideas of imperialism, people are starting to see humans as just resources to be trained for future benefits. Racism, which keeps brown and black people in low positions, is being seen as helpful to this way of thinking, even though it hurts the dreams and feelings of those who are struggling. Most of all, we keep hearing that education that inspires big dreams and focuses on culture and character is something only white people should have, and that it’s risky or unrealistic for black people.

People have especially criticized the old efforts to help black people get an education. In the history I talked about, there were four stages: first, lots of excitement and sacrifice; then, training teachers for many public schools; next, starting and growing those schools despite many problems; and finally, teaching workers skills for new industries. Some people have made fun of this progress, saying it doesn’t make sense. They claim it should have started with teaching black people manual work, then basic reading and writing, and only much later should there be higher schools for advanced learning.

But this plan never really worked in real life, and it’s easy to see why. Progress usually happens when a few special people push forward, and others slowly catch up with them. For example, universities came before common schools long ago, like how Harvard was built early in America. In the South, after the war, most freed black people didn’t have the skills needed for modern jobs. They first needed basic schools to learn reading, writing, and math, and they also needed higher schools to train teachers for those basic schools. White teachers came South to set up these basic schools. At first, almost no one thought about starting colleges, and most would have laughed at the idea.
