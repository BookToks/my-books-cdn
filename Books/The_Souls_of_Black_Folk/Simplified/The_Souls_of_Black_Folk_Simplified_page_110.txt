All this work is really important. Who would do it if Black people didn’t? How could Black people do it if they weren’t trained properly? If white people need colleges to provide teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, don’t Black people need the same?

If there are many Black young people who have the right character and talent to get higher education, and if the two and a half thousand who have already had some training have mostly helped their race and generation, then we have to ask: what role should Black colleges and educated Black people have in the future of the South?

It’s clear that the current separation between races and the strong feelings about race will eventually change as the South becomes more developed. But this change will need a lot of wisdom and patience. If the races are going to live side by side for many years, working together, following the same laws, understanding each other’s feelings, but still keeping some distance in personal matters, then this tough and unusual situation must be handled very carefully.

This will need open-minded and honest people, both white and Black. When it finally happens, American civilization will succeed. White people in the South are starting to understand this now, and it looks like university education will get better. But strangely, many of the people who support this good work don’t support higher education for Black people.

This is strange because no strong society can be built in the South if Black people stay uneducated and angry workers. If we try to fix this by making them only workers and nothing more, they won’t accept it. They are smart, they have learned about life, and they will keep thinking and trying to understand the world.

If you take away their best teachers and leaders, and close the door to chances for their smartest and boldest minds, do you think they will be happy with their situation?
