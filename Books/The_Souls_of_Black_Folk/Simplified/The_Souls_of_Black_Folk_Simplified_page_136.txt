More than eighty-eight percent of the people here—men, women, and kids—are farmers. Farming is pretty much the only job around. Most kids go to school only after the crops are safely stored, and very few stay in school once the spring planting starts.

Child labor is a big problem here. It keeps kids from learning and hurts their growth. Most grown men have the same kinds of jobs: about thirteen hundred are farmers, and two hundred work as laborers, drivers, and a few other jobs like artisans, shop owners, preachers, and teachers. Women’s work is even more limited: thirteen hundred fifty are farm workers, one hundred are servants or washerwomen, and only a small number are housewives, teachers, or seamstresses.

There is no group of people here who don’t work. In the U.S., many young people and adults don’t work because they’re learning, resting, or taking care of their homes. But here, ninety-six percent of people are working hard. There’s no one with free time to make their cabin feel cozy, no old people to share stories by the fire, and not much time for kids to just be kids or for teenagers to dream. Their boring daily work is only broken up by fun moments or a trip to town on Saturdays. Farming work is always the same and tough because there aren’t many machines or tools to help. But at least the work is done outside in fresh air, which is rare nowadays.

The land is still good for farming, even though it’s been used a lot. For most of the year, crops grow if you plant them: vegetables in April, grains in May, melons in June and July, hay in August, sweet potatoes in September, and cotton until Christmas. But most of the land grows only one crop, which keeps the farmers in debt. Why is that?

Far down the Baysan road, where big flat fields are next to huge oak forests, there is a big plantation. It used to cover thousands of acres here and beyond the woods. Thirteen hundred people worked there, all controlled by one owner who had power over their bodies and mostly their souls.
