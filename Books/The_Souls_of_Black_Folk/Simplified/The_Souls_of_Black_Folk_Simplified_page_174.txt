Feeling like his rights and most important beliefs are being ignored, and that people don’t listen to his fair demands anymore, the Black man faces a tough problem. Every day, the forces of prejudice, greed, and revenge seem to get stronger and find new supporters.

Knowing he feels powerless and often feeling hopeless, he can become bitter and angry. His religion, instead of bringing hope, turns into complaints and curses, more like sadness than faith. But some people are smarter and more clever. They see that the people against Black rights have weaknesses, and they try to use those weaknesses to help Black people, even if it means bending some rules. So, there are two main ways of thinking: one risks chaos, the other risks being fake. One group is almost ready to give up entirely, while the other sometimes betrays what’s right and fears standing up to power. The first group holds onto ideals that might be impossible, while the second forgets that life is about more than just survival. But maybe this is just the struggle of the times, shown through the Black experience—the fight between lies and violence.

Today, the two groups of Black people, one mostly in the North and the other in the South, show these different attitudes. The Northern group tends to be more extreme, while the Southern group often tries to make fake compromises. The white South feels sad about losing the old kind of Black person—the honest, simple servant who represented a time of submission and humility.

Even though he was lazy and didn’t have many qualities of true manhood, he was open-hearted, loyal, and sincere. Now he’s gone, but who is responsible for that? Isn’t it the same people who feel sorry for him? Isn’t it because after the Civil War and the backlash, society was built on lawbreaking and lies? This broke the honest spirit of a naturally straightforward people until whites became cruel rulers and blacks became criminals and fakers. Lying is a natural way for the weak to protect themselves against the strong. The South used it for many years against those in power, and now it has to face the fact that Black workers might use that same tricky tool against themselves.
