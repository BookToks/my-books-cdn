At that time, no one thought that former slaves could use their right to vote wisely or well; but people believed that giving such power to a large group would push others to help educate them to use it smartly.

Meanwhile, new problems came to the country: after every war, there’s usually a time when things get worse morally and there’s lots of political cheating. The scandals got so bad that honest people stopped getting involved in politics, and politics became seen as something bad. People started feeling proud about not caring about their government, and they agreed that public office was just a way to get personal benefits. Because of this attitude, it became easy to ignore the fact that Black people’s right to vote in the South was being stopped, and some even told proud Black people to stay out of politics. Good and respectable northern citizens who didn’t do their own civic duties laughed at how much importance Black people placed on voting. So, more and more, the better Black citizens stopped caring about politics, leaving only careless or dishonest people to vote.

The Black vote that was left wasn’t educated or trained, but instead was corrupted by open bribery, force, and lies. Black voters started to believe that politics was just a way to gain money or power through bad behavior.

Now, today, as we realize that the future of our government depends on cleaning up voting, teaching voters, and making voting a serious duty for every patriotic citizen, what should we say to Black voters in the South? Should we still tell them that politics is bad and useless? Should we let the best Black people lose interest in government and give up their right to care about it without fighting back? I’m not against trying to stop ignorant, poor, or criminal people from voting. But almost everyone agrees that the real goal of the new laws in the South is to keep Black people out of politics completely.
