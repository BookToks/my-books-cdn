There are many mixed groups where Mongolian and Teuton people have combined with Slavs, and other mixes have created the Romance nations and the Semites.

Race differences are mostly about physical traits, but these donâ€™t fully explain the deeper differences between groups. The real differences are about spirit and mind, which are connected to physical traits but go way beyond them. What holds the Teuton nations together is first their shared race and blood, and more importantly, their common history, laws, religion, ways of thinking, and goals in life. The way these race differences formed is a long process, where spiritual and mental differences grew while physical differences became less important.

Long ago, tribes were made up of close family groups, showing the most physical differences. They were like big families, with many separate groups. When families joined to make cities, physical differences became less important. Blood purity was replaced by living in the same place, so anyone living in the city was seen as part of the group. This slowly broke down physical barriers. But at the same time, spiritual and social differences grew between cities. One city might focus on farming, another on trading, another on fighting. Their goals and values were different.

Later, when cities joined to form nations, barriers between people broke down even more. Big physical differences like skin color and hair were still noticed, but many small differences disappeared. The social and historical races started to look more like the races we know today. At the same time, spiritual and physical differences between groups became very important. For example, the English nation valued freedom and business, the German nation focused on science and philosophy, and the Romance nations cared about art and literature. Each group tries to bring its own special ideas to help make the world better, moving closer to a perfect human life that everyone hopes for. This is what race differences have done so far.
