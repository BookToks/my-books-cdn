The book starts by talking about the political goals, cultural achievements, and deep hopes of a whole group of people. At the same time, it sets the main ideas for a national conversation about what race means after the time of slavery.

William H. Ferris said that Du Bois was a rare man who became well-known as a thinker and leader because he shared his personality through his writing. From the very beginning, in the ‘Forethought’, Du Bois brings the reader in with a strong reference to the Bible’s Book of Genesis. He asks if he needs to say that he is part of the people living “within the Veil.” The book, The Souls of Black Folk, is driven by Du Bois’s unique point of view.

Du Bois says that all the parts of the book are connected by a clear goal and a personal way of sharing himself. But the book is not just about his own life. Throughout the book, the way he talks changes. Sometimes he talks about himself alone, sometimes about the struggles of a whole group, sometimes he talks about others, and sometimes he speaks directly to the reader, asking them to be kind to his book.

Because of these changes, the idea he talks about—the “spiritual world” where many Americans live and try to succeed—is hard to pin down. It’s like a rough sketch that keeps changing because of history. The book shows that even smart people who study others can’t be completely unbiased. Instead, it’s important to admit where you stand and how you see the world.
