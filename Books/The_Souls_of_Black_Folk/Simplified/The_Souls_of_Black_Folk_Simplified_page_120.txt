Across from the door is a square desk made at home. In one corner, there are the broken remains of a stove, and in the other, a dark blackboard. This is the happiest schoolhouse I have seen in Dougherty, except for the one in town. Behind the schoolhouse is a two-story lodge that isn’t finished yet. Groups meet there—groups “to take care of the sick and bury the dead.” These groups grow and do well.

We had reached the edge of Dougherty and were about to turn west along the county line when a kind old man, black, white-haired, and seventy years old, showed us all these sights.

He had lived here for forty-five years and now supports himself and his old wife with the help of a steer tied nearby and the kindness of his black neighbors. He showed us the Hills’ farm just across the county line in Baker—a widow and her two strong sons who grew ten bales (you don’t even have to say “cotton” here) last year. There are fences, pigs, and cows, and the soft-spoken, smooth-skinned young Memnon, who shyly came over to say hello, is proud of his home. Now we turn west along the county line.

Huge broken pine trees stand over the green cotton fields, their bare twisted branches reaching toward the edge of the living forest beyond. This area isn’t very pretty; it feels rough and wild, showing power—a kind of raw greatness. The houses are plain and simple; there are no hammocks or comfy chairs, and very few flowers. So when, like here at Rawdon’s, you see a vine climbing a little porch and home-like windows looking over the fences, you take a deep breath. I think I never really understood how important fences are for civilization. This is the Land of No Fences, where on both sides there are many ugly one-room cabins, gloomy and dirty. This is where the Negro problem is clear in its dirt and poverty. And here, there are no fences. But sometimes, fences made of crisscrossed rails or straight boards appear, and then you know some culture is nearby. Of course, Harrison Gohagen—a quiet young yellow man, smooth-faced and hardworking—is the owner of about a hundred acres. We expect to see nice rooms, soft beds, and laughing children because he has good fences. And those fences over there—why do they build fences on rented land? It will only make their rent higher.

We keep going, winding through sand, pines, and glimpses of old plantations, until we see a group of buildings—wood and brick, mills and houses, and scattered cabins.
