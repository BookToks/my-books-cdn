Besides the people who officially belong to the church, there are many others who go to church activities and join in even if they’re not members. Across the country, there is one organized Black church for about every sixty Black families, and in some states, there’s one for every forty families. Each church owns about a thousand dollars’ worth of property on average, adding up to nearly twenty-six million dollars in total.

So, the Black church has grown a lot since Emancipation. Now, the question is: what were the important steps in this history, and what is happening now?

First, we need to understand that the Black church didn’t just appear out of nowhere. The social history of Black people didn’t start in America. They came from a specific social background — a polygamous clan led by a chief and influenced strongly by a priest. Their religion was about worshiping nature and believing in invisible forces, both good and bad. Their worship involved chants and sacrifices.

The first big change came with the slave ships and the West Indian sugar plantations. The plantation system replaced clans and tribes, and the white master took the place of the chief, with much stronger control. Hard, forced work became the norm, old family ties broke apart, and new complicated family situations appeared, sometimes nearly chaotic. This was a huge social change, but some parts of the old group life stayed. The most important figure left was the Priest or Medicine-man. He showed up on plantations as the healer, the one who explained the unknown, comforted those who were sad, got revenge in a spiritual way, and spoke out the feelings of a stolen and oppressed people.

So, acting as a storyteller, doctor, judge, and priest within the limits of slavery, the Black preacher emerged. Under him, the first Black American institution, the Black church, was born. At first, this church wasn’t really Christian or well-organized. Instead, it was a mix of pagan rituals practiced by people on each plantation and was roughly called Voodooism.
