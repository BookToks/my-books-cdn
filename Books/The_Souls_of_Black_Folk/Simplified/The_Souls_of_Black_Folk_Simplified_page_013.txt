Both pieces try to understand the situation of African-descended people around the year 1900 and think about what role African American thinkers should play as leaders and supporters of their communities. Even though they share some ideas and phrases, the two writings have very different styles.

Some experts recently have said that "The Conservation of Races" shows Du Boisâ€™s belief in a tricky idea of race based on biology. Although Du Bois admits that the word "race" is unclear, he still thinks the idea of race is important because it helps people work together and make progress. In the writing, Du Bois struggles to explain race in a way that goes beyond just biology, trying to include things like shared blood, family history, and physical traits, but also other more subtle reasons that divide people into groups. He can't fully explain these deeper differences and describes them vaguely as spiritual or mental qualities that go beyond just physical traits.

Because of this, African Americans feel confused about where they fit in America. Du Bois talks about this problem honestly and says any serious African American thinker has faced these tough questions: Am I American or am I Black? Can I be both? Or should I stop identifying as Black and just be American? If I focus on being Black, am I making the divide between Black and White worse?
