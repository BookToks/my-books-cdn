He is six feet tall, with a serious face that smiles softly. He walks very straight, not like a tenant––he owns two hundred and forty acres. “The land has gotten worse since the good days of 1850,” he says, and cotton prices are low. Three Black tenants live on his land, and in his small store, he sells a little tobacco, snuff, soap, and soda for the neighborhood. Here is his cotton gin with new machines. Last year, three hundred bales of cotton were processed there. He has sent two kids to school. He says sadly that he is getting older, but cotton costs only four cents now; he knows how debt keeps bothering him.

Wherever the King is, the parks and big houses of the Cotton Kingdom haven’t totally disappeared. We walk through big oak and tall pine trees, with bushes and plants underneath. This was the main house of the Thompsons––slave owners who used to drive fancy coaches long ago. Now it’s quiet, with ashes and weeds everywhere. The owner put all his money into cotton in the 1850s, but when prices dropped in the 1880s, he left. Over there is another grove, with an untended lawn, huge magnolia trees, and grass-covered paths. The Big House is half ruined, its front door staring empty at the street, and the back part oddly fixed up for its Black tenant. He is a well-built but unlucky Black man who works hard to pay rent to the white woman who owns the rest of the land. She married a policeman and lives in Savannah.

Sometimes we see churches. Here’s one called Shepherd’s––a big whitewashed building on stone stilts, looking like it might just move down the road at any moment. But it’s the center of about a hundred small homes, and on Sundays, up to five hundred people come to talk, eat, and sing together.

Nearby is a schoolhouse––a light, empty building. This is better than usual because most schools are held inside the church.

The churches range from simple log huts to buildings like Shepherd’s, and the schools from nothing at all to this small house sitting quietly on the county line. It’s a tiny wooden building, about ten by twenty feet, with two rows of rough benches inside, sometimes supported by legs, sometimes by boxes.
