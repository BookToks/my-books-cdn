He faced all the teasing, unfair judgments, hate, and discrimination with a special kindness that comes from a pure heart. He stood up against selfish and evil people, always staying strong and fair like a true hero. He never gave up or complained much; he just kept working, encouraging young people, correcting older ones, helping those who needed it, and guiding the strong.

Because of this, he grew and brought many good people under his influence. People outside didn’t understand or even imagine the great power and inspiration he had inside, hidden by the unfair social rules that kept most people from knowing it. Now that he’s gone, I want to reveal his true spirit and say, here is the soul I remember. I can still see his face, dark and lined with age under his white hair, sometimes glowing with hope, sometimes hurt by human cruelty, sometimes sad from painful memories. The more I met Alexander Crummell, the more I realized how much the world lost because it barely knew him. In another time, he might have been honored as a great leader; in another place, mothers might have sung songs about him to their babies.

He did his work nobly and well, but I feel sad that he worked mostly alone, with little support from others. Today, his name doesn’t mean much to most people in this big country, and millions don’t remember or try to learn from him. This is the real sadness of our time: it’s not that people are poor—everyone knows poverty; it’s not that people are bad—who is truly good? It’s not that people don’t know much—what really is truth? No, the tragedy is that people don’t understand each other.

One morning, he sat looking out at the sea. He smiled and said, “The gate is rusty on the hinges.” That night, a wind blew open the gate, and the soul I loved left like a flame across the seas, and in its place came Death.

I wonder where he is now? I wonder if, in that dark world beyond, as he arrived, a King—maybe a dark-skinned Jew who knows the pain of the suffering—rose on a pale throne and said, “Well done!” as he gave back the talents he was given, while the morning stars sang around him.
