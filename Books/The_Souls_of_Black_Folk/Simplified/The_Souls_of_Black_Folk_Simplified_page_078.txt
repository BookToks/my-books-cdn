People respect Mr. Booker T. Washington for advising patience and politeness when asking for rights. They don’t want uneducated black men to vote if uneducated white men can’t, and they agree that some fair rules about voting are okay. They know that many black people face unfair treatment because of their low social standing, but they also know that most of the problems come from strong racial prejudice, not the other way around.

They want this unfair prejudice, which is old and cruel, to stop. They don’t want it to be supported or ignored by important groups like the news or the church. Like Mr. Washington, they support good schools for black children with strong job training. But they are surprised that Mr. Washington doesn’t see that good education needs good colleges and universities too. They believe the South should have a few of these schools to train the best black students to become teachers, professionals, and leaders.

This group respects Mr. Washington for trying to make peace with white people in the South. They agree with his “Atlanta Compromise” in a broad way and see hope in the South. They know that the South has a hard job because it already struggles a lot. Still, they believe the best way forward is honesty, not just praising everyone. They think good people in the South should be praised, but bad actions should be called out clearly.

They believe people should use their chances to improve but always stick to their highest goals. They don’t expect voting rights, freedom, or education to come instantly or for racism to disappear overnight. But they are sure that the way to get fair rights is not by giving them up or saying they don’t want them. They believe respect doesn’t come from putting yourself down. Instead, black people must always say, no matter what, that voting is important, that racism is wrong, and that black boys need education just like white boys do.
