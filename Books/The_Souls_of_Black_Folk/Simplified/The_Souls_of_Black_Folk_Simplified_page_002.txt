W. E. B. Du Bois was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on February 23, 1868. In 1885, he went to Fisk University where he was the editor of the school paper, the Fisk Herald. After he graduated in June 1888, he kept studying at Harvard College and earned a master's degree in history in 1891.

He then studied more at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. In 1894, he came back to the United States to teach classics at Wilberforce University in Ohio. Du Bois was the first Black person to get a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1895. The next year, he moved to Philadelphia to study the lives of Black people there.

After that, he took a job teaching economics and history at Atlanta University. During the next ten years, he became famous as a smart thinker by writing the book The Souls of Black Folk in 1903. He also joined the Niagara Movement in 1905, which was a group of Black leaders fighting for full rights for Black people.

In 1910, Du Bois moved to New York and worked for the NAACP, editing their monthly magazine called The Crisis. In February 1919, he organized the First Pan-African Congress in Paris, bringing people from the U.S., the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa together.

Du Bois kept writing important books like Darkwater (1920), Dark Princess (1928), and Black Reconstruction (1935). After some political problems, he quit The Crisis in 1934 and went back to Atlanta University. There, he started and edited another journal called Phylon.

After World War II, Du Bois became more outspoken about criticizing U.S. foreign policies and race issues. He worked with peace groups and the Council on African Affairs. When he turned 90, he traveled around Europe, the Soviet Union, and China in 1958 and 1959.

In 1961, Kwame Nkrumah, the president of Ghana, invited Du Bois to live in Africa. Du Bois accepted and moved to Ghana. He died there on August 27, 1963, just before the huge civil rights march in Washington, D.C.
