xiii Of the Coming of John What do they bring at midnight,  
Beside the River-sea?  

They bring the human heart where  
No peace comes at night;  
It never falls with the wind,  
Nor dries with the dew;  
Oh God, calm it; your calm is wide  
Enough to cover spirits too.  

The river keeps flowing.  

Mrs. Browning.* Carlisle Street goes west from the middle of Johnstown,  
Crossing a big black bridge, going down a hill and then up again,  
Past small shops and meat markets, and single-story houses,  
Until it suddenly ends at a big green lawn.  

It’s a wide, peaceful place with two large buildings standing out against the west.  
In the evening, when the wind blows from the east,  
And the city’s smoky air hangs tired over the valley,  
The red sky in the west glows like a dream down Carlisle Street.  

At the sound of the dinner bell,  
Students dressed in dark clothes walk by,  
Tall and black, moving slowly,  
Their shadows look like scary ghosts against the sky.  

Maybe they are; because this is Wells Institute,  
And these black students don’t have much contact with the white city below.
