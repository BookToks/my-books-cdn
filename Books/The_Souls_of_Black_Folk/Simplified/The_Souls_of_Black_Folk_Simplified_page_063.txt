These were the saddest sights of that terrible day; no one reached out to help these two people caught between the past and the present. But filled with hate, they went to their final resting place, and with hate, their children’s children live today.

This was the job for the Freedmen’s Bureau. Even though people were unsure about it, the Bureau kept working from 1868 to 1869. Let’s look at what it did in those four years. In 1868, there were nine hundred Bureau workers from Washington to Texas, helping millions of people. Their work focused on seven main things: helping with sickness and pain, starting free labor, buying and selling land, setting up schools, paying bonuses, making sure justice was done, and managing money for all these tasks.

By June 1869, doctors and nurses in the Bureau had treated over half a million patients, and sixty hospitals and care centers were open. In forty-two months, they gave out twenty-one million free food packs, spending over four million dollars. Then came the hard part: work. Thirty thousand Black men were sent from safe places back to farms to try a new way of working. Washington told them that workers could choose their bosses, no set wages were forced, and no one could be forced to work against their will. So far, so good; but because local workers were very different and kept changing, results were mixed. The biggest success was that most freedmen wanted to work. So, they made fifty thousand work contracts in one state alone, helped workers, promised fair pay, and found bosses. The Bureau became a huge job agency—not perfect, with some problems, but mostly better than anyone expected.

The two biggest problems for the officials were the cruel slave owners who wanted slavery to continue in a new form, and the freedmen who thought freedom meant never working—both serious challenges.
