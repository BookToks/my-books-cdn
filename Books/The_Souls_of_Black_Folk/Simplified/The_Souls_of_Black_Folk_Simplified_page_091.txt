Whittier.* South of the North but north of the South is the City of a Hundred Hills. It looks out from the past toward a hopeful future. I have seen her in the morning when she was just waking up; she lay quiet and gray on the red soil of Georgia. Then smoke started to rise from her chimneys, bells rang, whistles blew, and the city slowly woke up. The sounds grew louder until the busy city felt strange in such a calm land.

They say Atlanta used to be sleepy and slow at the base of the Allegheny Mountains. But the harsh war woke her up, making her angry and restless, and she began to listen to the sea. The sea called to the hills, and the hills answered back, until the city stood up like a widow who had lost her husband and stopped wearing black. She worked hard every day for what she needed, working steadily and smartly—maybe a little bitter and proud—but with real effort and sweat.

It’s hard to live with the memory of a broken dream. To watch a big hope turn into ashes and dirt. To feel the pain of losing, but also know that something that shouldn’t have survived was defeated. To understand that with the right that won, some wrong also won—the ugly, small things that weren’t the best or widest part of us.
