In a small wooden schoolhouse, the boys and girls got the idea to buy pretty visiting cards—ten cents for a pack—and trade them with each other. The trading was fun until a tall new girl refused to take my card, looking at me in a way that said no. Then I suddenly realized I was different from the others. Maybe I felt the same inside, but I was kept out of their world by a big invisible wall. After that, I didn’t want to break through that wall. Instead, I looked down on everything beyond it and imagined myself living above it, in a place with blue sky and big moving shadows.

That sky felt brightest when I could beat my classmates at tests, or win a race, or even outsmart them.

But as I got older, those strong feelings started to fade. The worlds I dreamed of, with all their amazing chances, belonged to them, not me. But I told myself I wouldn’t let them keep those chances. I wanted to take some, or all, for myself. I didn’t know exactly how—maybe by studying law, helping sick people, or telling the amazing stories in my head—somehow. Other Black boys didn’t feel this hopeful fight. Their young years turned into fake smiles to please others, or quiet anger and distrust of white people, or a sad cry asking why God made them feel like strangers in their own home. We all felt trapped like in a prison: the walls were hard for everyone, but especially tight and impossible to climb for Black kids. We had to keep moving forward quietly, or angrily hit the walls that wouldn’t break, or keep watching the small bit of blue sky above, feeling half hopeless.

After many groups of people—Egyptians, Indians, Greeks, Romans, Germans, and Mongolians—the Black person is like a seventh child, born with a veil, and able to see things in a special way in America. This country doesn’t let them truly know themselves but only lets them see themselves through how others see them. This feeling is strange—always looking at yourself through other people’s eyes, measuring your soul by a world that watches with a mix of pity and mockery. You always feel two parts inside you—an American and a Black person; two souls, two thoughts, two struggles that don’t fit together; two fighting ideas inside one dark body, whose strong will is the only thing stopping it from breaking apart.
