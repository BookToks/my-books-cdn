Led by Remond, Nell, Wells-Brown, and Douglass, a new time of standing up for themselves and growing as people began. The leaders wanted full freedom and to be accepted by society, but they mainly believed that Black people had to fight for their own rights. John Brown’s raid was the most extreme example of this idea. After the war and freedom from slavery, Frederick Douglass, the greatest Black American leader, still guided the movement.

The main goal was standing up for political rights. After Douglass came leaders like Elliot, Bruce, Langston, and others involved in rebuilding the South. There were also important social figures like Alexander Crummell and Bishop Daniel Payne. Then in 1876, things changed—the Black vote was suppressed, ideas shifted, and people looked for new ways to fight back. Even when he was old, Douglass stayed strong, believing in full acceptance through self-assertion and no other way. For a while, Price appeared as a new leader who seemed ready to keep pushing the old goals in a way the white South might accept. But he died young.

Then a new leader came. Most earlier leaders were chosen by their own people and mostly known only within their race, except Douglass. But Booker T. Washington became a leader for both Black and white people, trying to find a middle ground between the South, the North, and Black communities. At first, many Black people were angry because Washington seemed to give up some civil and political rights in exchange for better job and business opportunities. The rich North was tired of dealing with racial issues and was investing a lot in the South, so they liked Washington’s peaceful approach. Over time, more people accepted Washington’s leadership, and criticism quieted down.

Washington’s ideas show a long-standing attitude of settling and accepting things as they are, but at a special time that made his plan different. This was a time of big economic growth, so Washington’s program naturally fit that moment.
