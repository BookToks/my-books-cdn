The main worry is mostly in the hearts of those four Black men over there—and in mine too.

We head south in a serious way. The bare red dirt and pine trees of Northern Georgia start to fade away, and instead, we see rich, rolling land that looks full of life, with some parts well farmed.

This land used to belong to the Creek Indians, and the Georgians had a tough time taking it. The towns get closer together and more interesting, and new cotton mills pop up everywhere. After we pass Macon, the world seems darker because we’re entering the Black Belt—a strange place that even scared slaves back then, and now only sends quiet, unclear stories to the outside world. The “Jim Crow Car” we ride in gets bigger and a little nicer; three tough field workers and a few lazy white men ride with us, and the newsboy still sells papers at one end. The sun is setting, but we can still see the huge cotton fields as we enter—sometimes the soil is dark and rich, sometimes thin and gray, with fruit trees and old, falling-apart buildings—all the way to Albany.

We stop at Albany, right in the middle of the Black Belt. It’s two hundred miles south of Atlanta, two hundred miles west of the Atlantic Ocean, and one hundred miles north of the Gulf of Mexico. Dougherty County has about ten thousand Black people and two thousand white people. The Flint River comes down from Andersonville, turns sharply at Albany (the county’s main town), and rushes on to meet the Chattahoochee River and the sea. Andrew Jackson knew the Flint River well—he once crossed it to get revenge for the Indian Massacre at Fort Mims back in 1814, not long before the battle of New Orleans. After that, the Creek Indians signed a treaty giving Georgia this land. But settlers didn’t want to move here at first because the Indians were still nearby and were dangerous neighbors. The panic of 1837, which Jackson left for President Van Buren, made planters from Virginia, the Carolinas, and east Georgia look west instead. The Indians were forced to move to Indian Territory, and settlers rushed into this rich land to rebuild their lives. Around Albany, there’s a big, fertile area filled with forests of pine, oak, ash, hickory, and poplar trees; it’s hot and damp with rich black swamp land. This is where the foundation of the Cotton Kingdom was built.

Today, Albany is a calm Southern town with wide streets, lots of stores and bars, and rows of homes—white people usually live to the north, and Black people to the south.
