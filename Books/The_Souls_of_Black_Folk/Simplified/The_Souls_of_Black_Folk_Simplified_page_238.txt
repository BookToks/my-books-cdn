In 1901, the Sixth Atlanta Conference said: “Less than one million out of three million Black children who should be in school are actually going, and they only go for a few months each year.

“We are purposely keeping millions of our people uneducated, while also making it hard for them to have full citizenship because of education rules. This isn’t fair. Half of the Black youth have no chance to learn how to read, write, or do math. When people talk about how to train Black children after public school, they forget that many don’t even have good public schools yet.

“Some places in the South want to make the already small number of schools for Black children even smaller. We are glad the South has resisted this pressure and has spent money on Black education. But it’s fair to say that Black people’s taxes and other money have probably paid for these schools, so white taxpayers likely haven’t spent a single cent on Black schools since the war.

“This is unfair. Black schools should be paid for by the public because they help everyone. Black people have the right to good schooling from the States and the Nation because they can’t afford it themselves.

“What does the South need most to improve Black public schools? Teachers. Everyone who knows the situation agrees. To meet this need, we need colleges and money for school buildings and teacher pay. Some think there are too many schools training Black teachers, but that’s wrong. There are fewer than 3,000 Black college graduates in the whole country and less than 1,000 Black students in college now.

“Also, out of 164 schools for Black students, 95% are teaching only basic and high school subjects, which should be taught in public schools. Most of the so-called 'normal' schools are really just teaching basic or high school work with a little training on how to teach.”
