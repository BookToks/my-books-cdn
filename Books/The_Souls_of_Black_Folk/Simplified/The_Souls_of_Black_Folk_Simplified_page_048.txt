As time went by, he started to understand a new idea. Freedom wasn’t easy to get, and it needed strong tools. The Fifteenth Amendment gave him those tools. Before, he thought voting was just a symbol of freedom, but now he saw it as the main way to get and improve the freedom the war had partly given him. And why not? Didn’t votes help start the war and free millions? Didn’t votes give freed slaves the right to vote? If votes could do all that, what couldn’t they do? A million black men began to vote with new energy, hoping to win their place in the world.

The years passed quickly, the big changes of 1876 happened, and left many half-free people tired and confused but still hopeful. Slowly, a new dream started to take the place of the hope for political power. A strong movement grew, bringing a new goal to follow—learning from books. This was the desire to know, born from being kept ignorant on purpose. Finally, it seemed like they found a hard but clear path to a better life. This path was longer and tougher than the road to freedom and laws, but it led to high places where they could see far ahead.

The first people on this new path worked hard, slowly and steadily. Only those who watched and helped knew how much effort it took for these students to learn. It was tough work. Cold numbers showed small progress here and there, and also where someone slipped or fell. For these tired travelers, the future often looked dark, the challenges were hard, and the goal seemed far away. But even if they didn’t see a clear finish or rest stop, the journey gave them time to think and understand themselves better. It changed them from children of freedom to young people aware of who they were, proud of themselves. In the hard struggle, they saw their own souls, even if unclear, and felt a small glimpse of their power and purpose. They started to feel that to find their place in the world, they had to be true to themselves and not try to be someone else. For the first time, they began to think about the heavy burden they carried—the weight of being looked down on in society, something only partly understood as the “Negro problem.”
