When the Freedmen’s Bureau tried to help Black people become landowners, they faced many problems and eventually were stopped completely.

Some progress was made, and bigger plans were made too. Land that had been left empty was rented out while the Bureau was in charge, bringing in almost half a million dollars from Black tenants. Other lands owned by the government were sold with easy payment plans, and some public lands were opened for a few freedmen who had tools and money to start farming. But the dream of “forty acres and a mule”—the fair hope of owning land that the freedmen were almost promised—often ended in disappointment. The chance to connect Black farmers to the land was lost when the Freedmen’s Bureau had to tell crying freedmen in South Carolina that the land was not theirs after all, that there had been a mistake. By 1874, if Black people in Georgia owned 350,000 acres, it was because they worked hard, not because the government gave it to them.

The biggest success of the Freedmen’s Bureau was starting free schools for Black people and promoting free elementary education for everyone in the South. They sent teachers through kind organizations and built school buildings. They also helped support important educators like Edmund Ware, Samuel Armstrong, and Erastus Cravath. At first, many people in the South hated Black education and tried to stop it with violence and insults because they thought educated Black people were dangerous. And they weren’t totally wrong—education can bring change, unrest, and dissatisfaction. Still, people want to learn. Maybe understanding this helped soldiers calm down some of the hatred toward Black education, which still exists quietly today in the South but not as openly. Schools like Fisk, Atlanta, Howard, and Hampton were started during this time, and six million dollars were spent on education, with Black people themselves giving 750,000 dollars even though many were poor.
