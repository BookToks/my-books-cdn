In the introduction to the Blue Heron edition, Du Bois said he made only a few small changes—less than six words or phrases—in the 1953 version of the book. 

In 1973, historian Herbert Aptheker found seven changes when he prepared another edition. Later, literary expert Henry Louis Gates, Jr., with help from the Black Periodical Literature project, compared the 1903 and 1953 editions line by line. He found two more changes, which were first pointed out in the 1989 Bantam edition. 

All nine changes are listed below. The new words are in italics, and the page numbers match this edition:  
- p. 70 (1903) “And first we may say that this type of college, including Atlanta, Fisk, and Howard, Wilberforce and Lincoln, Biddle, Shaw...”  
- (1953) “Claflin”  
- p. 87 (1903) “The Jew is the heir of the slave-baron in Dougherty...”  
- (1953) “Immigrants are heirs”  
- p. 87 (1903) “... nearly all failed, and the Jew fell heir.”  
- (1953) “... most failed, and foreigners fell heir.”  
- p. 88 (1903) “This plantation, owned now by a Russian Jew...”  
- (1953) “foreigner”  
- p. 88 (1903) “... out of which only a Yankee or a Jew could squeeze more blood from debt-cursed tenants.”  
- (1953) “an immigrant”  
- p. 91 (1903) “Since then his nephews and the poor whites and the Jews have seized it.”  
- (1953) “poor relations and foreign immigrants”  
- p. 115 (1903) “... thrifty and avaricious Yankee, shrewd and unscrupulous Jews.”  
- (1953) “immigrants”  
- p. 116 (1903) “... the enterprising Russian Jew who sold it to him...”  
- (1953) “American”  
- p. 138 (1903) “It is the same defence which the Jews of the Middle Age used...”  
- (1953) “peasants”  

On February 27, 1953, Du Bois wrote a letter to Aptheker. Aptheker shared it in his introduction to the 1973 edition to explain why Du Bois might have made these changes, especially about the word “Jews.” Du Bois said that a friend in Los Angeles gave him a copy of “Souls of Black Folk.”
