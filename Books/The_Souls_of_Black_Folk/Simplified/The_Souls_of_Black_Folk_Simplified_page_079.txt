If the smart and educated Black people in America don’t clearly say what their community needs, even if it means disagreeing with a respected leader, they would be avoiding a big responsibility. They have a duty to themselves, to the people struggling around them, to other dark-skinned races whose future depends a lot on how America does, and especially to the country they all share.

It’s wrong to support something bad just because it’s easier or more popular to stay quiet. The growing peace and friendship between the North and South after the terrible fights of the past generation should make everyone happy, especially those who were treated badly and caused the war. But if that peace means Black people are forced into hard, unfair jobs and treated as less than others by law forever, then those Black men, if they really care about their country, must fight against this in civil ways—even if it means disagreeing with Mr. Booker T. Washington. We can’t just watch quietly while we set up our kids, Black and white, for disaster.

First, Black people should judge the South carefully. The people living in the South now are not to blame for what happened in the past, and they shouldn’t be hated or blamed without thinking.

Also, no one dislikes the South’s current treatment of Black people more than the smartest thinkers in the South. The South is not all the same; it is a place where many different ideas and groups are fighting for control. Praising the bad things happening there now is just as wrong as only blaming the good things. The South needs honest and open criticism to help all its people grow up healthy in mind and character.

Today, even Southern white people don’t all think the same way about Black people. Some uneducated Southerners hate Black people, some workers are scared of losing jobs to them, business owners want to use them as cheap labor, and some educated people have different views.
