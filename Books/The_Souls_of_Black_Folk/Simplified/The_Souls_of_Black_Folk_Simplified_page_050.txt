We are sick and dying, the dark crowds cried; we can’t even vote properly, so what’s the point of learning? Since we’re always stuck cooking and serving, why bother with education? And the Nation agreed with this, saying: Be happy just being servants, nothing more; why should half-people get a good education? Take away the black man’s right to vote, by force or trickery, –– and watch a whole race destroy itself!

But even from this bad situation came something good –– education started to connect more with real life, people realized the responsibilities of Black folks in society, and everyone began to understand what progress really means.

Then came a time of storm and stress: today, our little boat is rocked by wild waves on the huge sea of the world. There’s conflict everywhere, pain inside and out; hope fights with doubt, and faith struggles with tough questions. The bright dreams of the past –– freedom, political power, training the mind and hands –– all have had their ups and downs, and even those hopes seem unclear now. Are they all wrong? No, but each one alone was too simple and incomplete –– like childish dreams or ideas from a world that doesn’t understand our strength. To be true, all these dreams must come together as one.

Today, we need school training more than ever –– training skilled hands, sharp eyes and ears, and above all, a deeper, higher education for gifted minds and pure hearts. We need the power to vote to protect ourselves –– otherwise, what will stop us from being slaves again? We still want freedom –– freedom to live, to work, to think, to love, and to dream. Work, culture, and liberty –– we need all of them together, growing and helping each other, all reaching toward a bigger dream for Black people: the dream of human brotherhood, reached through unity in our race. The goal is to grow and support the talents of Black people, not to fight or look down on other races, but to live with the bigger ideals of America. Someday, on American soil, two great races will share and give each other what they both sadly lack.

We Black people don’t come empty-handed: today, no one shows the true human spirit of the Declaration of Independence better than Black Americans; no true American music exists without the sweet songs of Black slaves; American stories come from Native and African roots; and, all in all, Black people seem to be the only pure place of simple faith and respect in a world full of money and show-offs.
