Negro colleges have played a special role in training teachers. Many people don’t realize how big and important this work has been. In just one generation, these colleges helped provide teachers for over five million Black people. This was really hard to do but very important because it gave Black children role models they could look up to. It also connected many Black people to modern life and made Black men leaders and teachers in their communities. College-educated Black teachers taught others how to teach, too. The education they got wasn’t just about getting a job but also about understanding life and culture, which was something many Black people didn’t know much about before. This kind of teaching helped train these men in a special way.

In the past, most Black college graduates could only become preachers or teachers. But now, there are more job options because life for Black people is changing. These college graduates have not been poor or wasteful. In 1899, 557 college-educated Black people owned property worth over $1.3 million, which is about $2,400 per family. The total value of everything owned by this group might be around $10 million, or $5,000 each. This is small compared to rich oil or steel businessmen, but is having a lot of money the only way to be successful? Sadly, many people think it is, and that causes problems.

Today, training Black people is more complicated because people are arguing about what kind of education is best for any child. These arguments often distract from the real question for Southern Black people: What kind of education will help them move up in society as fast as possible? The answer is clear: education must build strong character, increase knowledge, and teach how to make a living. It’s hard to do all these things at once or quickly, and focusing on just one is not enough. Teaching trades alone won’t fully improve a race of former slaves. Just giving knowledge won’t make people use it honestly. And teaching character without meeting basic needs like food and clothes won’t help either.
