We think that real effort from white people in this country is needed to make important changes in these issues.

Based on this belief, and knowing our great future, we, as African Americans, are determined to work hard in every good way to reach the best goals. 

We want to help build strong men and women and raise a proud community in both America and Africa, to honor God and help African American people grow and succeed.
