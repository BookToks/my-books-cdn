Will America be worse off if she replaces her harsh and confused mistakes with a light-hearted but strong sense of Black humility? Or if she changes her rough and mean jokes to kind and happy humor?

Or if she swaps her rude music for the deep feeling found in the Sorrow Songs?

The Black Problem is really just a real test of the basic ideas of this great country. The spiritual struggle of the freedmenâ€™s children is a heavy burden almost too hard to carry, but they hold on for their historic race, for this land of their ancestors, and for the chance of opportunity for everyone.
