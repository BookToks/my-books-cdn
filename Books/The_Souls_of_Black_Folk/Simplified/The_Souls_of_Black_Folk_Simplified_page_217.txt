People are very different from each other in many ways. For example, skin color can be very different—from the very pale skin of Scandinavians to the dark brown skin of the Zulu. There are also people with creamy skin like Slavs, yellowish skin like the Chinese, light brown skin like Sicilians, and brown skin like Egyptians.

People’s hair is different too. Some have very straight hair, like the Chinese, while others have curly, frizzy hair, like the Bushman. Head shapes change a lot as well. Some have broad heads, like the Tartars, some have medium-sized heads, like Europeans, and some have narrow heads, like the Hottentots. Even language is different—from the complicated Roman languages to the simple, one-syllable Chinese language.

All these differences are easy to see, and if they matched up perfectly, it would be simple to group people into races. But unfortunately, these things don’t always line up. For example, many dark-skinned people have straight hair, and the yellow-skinned Tartars have broader heads than Germans. Scientists haven’t yet figured out how to sort all these differences clearly using language or physical traits. So far, science says there are at least two or maybe three big groups of humans—the white race, the black race, and possibly the yellow race. Other groups likely come from mixing these main groups.

This way of dividing people is more accurate than older ideas that split humans into five races. It shows that physical differences don’t explain everything about how groups of people have lived or acted. As Darwin said, even though people look very different, their similarities are much greater. This idea is the basis for the scientific belief in Human Brotherhood.

Even though the big physical differences like skin color, hair, and bone shape don’t explain why different groups have had different roles in history, there are smaller, harder-to-see differences that have quietly separated people into groups. These small differences usually follow family lines and physical traits, but sometimes they don’t. Still, these groups, called races, may be hard to define scientifically but are clear to historians and sociologists.

If this is true, then world history is really about groups of people, not just individuals. It’s about races more than just nations. Ignoring the idea of race in history means missing the most important part of understanding history.
