He worked hard every week, every day, every month. But the church got smaller and smaller each month. The empty walls felt louder each week. Fewer and fewer people came each day. And every day, a quiet, tricky voice grew louder inside him. It was a tempting voice, calm and smiling but a little mocking. At first, it spoke casually: “Oh, colored folks? Yeah.” Or more clearly: “What do you expect?” The voice showed doubt—the temptation of Doubt.

He hated this voice and fought it angrily! “Of course they can learn and try and succeed,” he shouted. But the temptation whispered back softly, “No, they don’t do that.” Of all the temptations, this one hurt the most. Hate? He had grown past that. Despair? He fought that with all his strength. But doubting the value of his work, doubting the future and abilities of the people he cared about, was almost too much to bear. To see them lazy and hopeless instead of eager and strong, to hear himself thinking, “They don’t care; they don’t understand; why bother?”—this was more than he could handle. He closed the door, sat down on the church steps, threw off his robe, and struggled with his feelings.

The evening sunlight made the dust dance in the dark church when he finally stood up. He folded his clothes, put away the hymnbooks, and closed the big Bible. He walked outside into the dim light, looked back at the small pulpit with a tired smile, and locked the door. Then he walked quickly to the Bishop and told him what the Bishop already knew. “I have failed,” he said simply.

Feeling braver after saying this, he added, “I need a bigger group. There aren’t many Black people here, and maybe they aren’t the best. I have to go somewhere with more people and try again.” So the Bishop sent him to Philadelphia with a letter for Bishop Onderdonk. Bishop Onderdonk lived up six white steps. He was a big, red-faced man who had written some important papers about church leadership. It was after dinner, and the Bishop was ready to relax when suddenly the bell rang, and a letter and a thin, awkward Black man showed up to interrupt him.
