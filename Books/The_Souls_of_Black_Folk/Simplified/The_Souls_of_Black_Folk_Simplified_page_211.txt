He went back to his old forests again. Later on, his sad way of thinking changed, and even when working hard in the dirt and dust, he sang: “Dust, dust and ashes, fly over my grave, But the Lord shall carry my spirit home.” The things he took from the world around him changed in a special way when a slave said them. This is especially true for Bible phrases. For example, “Weep, O captive daughter of Zion,” became “Zion, weep-a-low,” and the wheels from Ezekiel’s story turned into a dream: “There’s a little wheel a-turnin’ in-a-my heart.”

Like long ago, the words of these songs were made up by a leading singer in the group. But the situation, the rhythm, and the allowed ideas kept the songs short, mostly one or two lines. They rarely got longer, except for a few Bible retellings. Three short sets of verses have always caught my attention. The first one is at the start of this chapter. Thomas Wentworth Higginson said about it, “Never, it seems to me, since humans first lived and suffered has the deep wish for peace been said so sadly.”

The second and third sets describe the Last Judgment. One is a newer song with some outside influence: “Oh, the stars in the elements are falling, And the moon drips away into blood, And the saved of the Lord are coming back to God, Blessed be the name of the Lord.” The other is an older, simpler picture from the low coastal lands: “Michael, pull the boat ashore, Then you’ll hear the horn they blow, Then you’ll hear the trumpet sound, Trumpet sound the world around, Trumpet sound for rich and poor, Trumpet sound the Jubilee, Trumpet sound for you and me.”

Through all the sadness in these Sorrow Songs, there is hope—a belief that things will be made right in the end.
