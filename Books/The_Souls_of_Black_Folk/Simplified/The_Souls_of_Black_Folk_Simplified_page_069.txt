Many people who worked for the Freedmen’s Bureau wanted power and got involved in sketchy activities. Because the South held strong unfair beliefs, they ignored all the good things the Bureau did and hated its name completely.

So, the Freedmen’s Bureau ended, but it led to the Fifteenth Amendment.

When a great organization ends before finishing its job, it’s like a person dying too soon. But it leaves behind a hope for future efforts. The Freedmen’s Bureau left a big challenge for today’s generation. Now, as new and bigger problems test the country, we should think carefully about this challenge. Everyone knows this: even after fighting and compromises, Black people are still not truly free. In parts of the South, Black people can’t leave the farms where they were born. In most rural areas, Black farmers are stuck in a kind of economic slavery, only escaping through death or jail. In Southern cities, Black people are treated like a separate, lower class with fewer rights. The law treats them differently, and they have no real political voice. This situation causes crime and unrest. This is the big problem the Freedmen’s Bureau couldn’t fix.

I have seen a sunny, happy land where children sing and hills roll like women full of life and harvest. There, on the King’s Highway, sits a bowed and hidden figure that travelers hurry past. Fear hangs in the air. Three hundred years of thinking have shaped that bowed heart, and now a new century faces its challenge. The main problem of the 20th Century is the problem of racial division.
