The small moments of sadness often change into feelings of victory and calm confidence. Sometimes people believe in life, sometimes in death, and sometimes they trust in a fair world where justice is endless. But no matter what, the meaning is always clear: someday, somewhere, people will judge others by who they really are inside, not by their skin color. Is this hope real?

Do the Sorrow Songs tell the truth?

Right now, many people believe that races have been tested and the ones seen as “backward” today are useless and can’t be helped. This idea is arrogant and shows a lack of respect for history and how people grow. A thousand years ago, this belief would have made it hard for the Teutons to prove they deserved to live. Two thousand years ago, it would have been crazy to think blond races would ever lead the world. We don’t really understand progress, how fast or slow people improve, or what limits there are to becoming better. Why did Æschylus write his plays 2,000 years before Shakespeare? Why has Europe done well while African civilizations have often failed?

As long as the world stays silent about these questions, should this country show its ignorance and unfairness by refusing equal chances to those who brought the Sorrow Songs to powerful places?

Your country? How did it become yours? We were here before the Pilgrims arrived. We brought three gifts and mixed them with yours: the gift of stories and songs—soft, moving music in a land that had no harmony; the gift of hard work and strength to fight the wild land, farm the soil, and build this huge economy two hundred years before your weak hands could have done it; and the third, the gift of Spirit. For three hundred years, history has focused around us; from the nation’s heart, we have called out the best to fight the worst. Fire and blood, prayer and sacrifice have covered this people, and they have only found peace through the God of Right. Our gift of Spirit hasn’t just been quiet. We have actively joined the very fabric of this nation—we fought their wars, shared their pain, mixed our blood with theirs, and for many generations have begged a stubborn, careless people not to hate Justice, Mercy, and Truth, or the nation will be cursed.
