There were two unfair justice systems. One was too easy on white criminals, letting them get away with crimes. The other was too harsh on Black people, treating them unfairly and not giving them a fair chance. The police in the South were not just watching criminals but all Black people. After slavery ended, the courts were used to control Black people by punishing them for almost anything, mostly because of their skin color, not because of real crimes.

Because of this, Black people saw the courts as unfair and felt that those punished were treated like victims.

When Black people did commit serious crimes like robbery, burglary, murder, or rape, both Black and white communities reacted strangely. Black people didn’t trust white witnesses or juries, so criminals didn’t feel shame or fear from their own community. Instead, they were seen as suffering unfairly. Meanwhile, white people often acted too harshly and without fairness, driven by anger instead of justice.

This situation made crime worse. It caused anger and revenge on both sides, making peace and progress very hard.

The biggest problem isn’t punishing criminals but stopping young people from turning to crime in the first place. In the South, this was hard because young kids were put in chains and worked alongside hardened criminals right in front of schools. This mixing of kids and adults made prisons like schools where crime and bad behavior were learned. The fight to create better places for young offenders in some states is a hopeful sign that people are starting to see how harmful the old ways were.
