It surprised the whole country to hear a Black man supporting this kind of plan after many years of angry complaints. People in the South were shocked but also clapped for him. The North was interested and admired him too. After some confused protests, even Black people stopped arguing and mostly agreed with him.

Mr. Washington’s first goal was to get the white people in the South to understand and work with him. When Tuskegee was started, this seemed almost impossible for a Black man. But ten years later, he did it with a speech in Atlanta: “In social life, we can be as separate as fingers on a hand, but together as one in the important things that help us all progress.” This idea, called the “Atlanta Compromise,” was the most important part of Mr. Washington’s work. People in the South saw it in different ways. Some thought he gave up on fighting for equal rights, while others saw it as a smart way to work together. Both groups liked it, and today he is one of the most respected people in the South, with many followers.

After that, Mr. Washington worked to gain respect in the North. Others had tried to be accepted by both the North and South but failed. Mr. Washington knew the South well because he grew up there. He also understood what the North cared about at that time, like business success and making money. He stopped thinking that a poor Black boy studying French in a dirty, forgotten home was a good picture. You might wonder what famous thinkers like Socrates or St. Francis would say about that.

Still, having a clear focus and being in tune with the times is what makes someone successful. It’s like Nature makes people narrow-minded to give them strength. Because of this, many people followed Mr. Washington without question. His work grew a lot, he had many friends, and his enemies were confused. Today, he is the main voice for ten million Black people and one of the most important people in a country of seventy million. So, it’s hard to criticize his life.
