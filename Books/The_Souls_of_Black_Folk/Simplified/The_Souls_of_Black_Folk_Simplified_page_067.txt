In 1874, General Howard was put on trial because the Secretary and his helpers said he had done something wrong. In both trials, the Freedmen’s Bureau leader was officially found not guilty and praised for his work. Still, some bad things came out. The way the Bureau did its work was not good; some money was stolen, and other scams were suspected. Some business deals seemed risky or dishonest. Also, the Freedmen’s Bank was involved in problems.

The Freedmen’s Bank was connected to the Freedmen’s Bureau in spirit and purpose, even though they weren’t legally linked.

With the government’s support and a respected board, the bank started well by helping Black people learn to save money, something slavery had stopped them from doing. But one day, the bank collapsed, and all the freedmen’s savings were lost. This was a big loss, but even worse was the loss of trust in saving money and in people. This hurt the freedmen more than slavery had. Not even ten more years of slavery could have stopped them from saving as much as the bad management and failure of these banks did. It’s hard to know who is to blame—whether the Bureau and Bank failed because of their own friends or their enemies. Maybe history will never fully explain it.

The biggest enemies of the Bureau were those who didn’t just criticize how it worked but questioned why it existed at all. These attacks mostly came from the Border States and the South. Senator Davis from Kentucky said the 1866 law was just a way to cause fights between white and Black people by giving illegal power. This argument was strong in both the South and the North, but its strength was also its weakness.
