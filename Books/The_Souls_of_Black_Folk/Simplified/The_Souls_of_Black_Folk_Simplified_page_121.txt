It looked like a normal village at first. But as we got closer, things changed: the buildings were falling apart, bricks were missing, the mills were quiet, and the store was shut. Only sometimes did you see a little bit of lazy life in the cabins. I thought the place might be under some strange spell, and I almost wanted to find the princess.

An old, ragged black man, honest and simple, told us the story. The Wizard of the North—the Capitalist—came in the 1870s to try to make this land rich. He bought a big piece of land, and for a while, the workers sang, the machines worked, and the mills were busy. But then things went wrong. The agent’s son stole the money and ran away. Then the agent disappeared too. Finally, a new agent stole even the records, and the company got angry. They shut everything down, stopped selling, and let the houses, furniture, and machines fall apart. So the Waters-Loring plantation stopped working because of dishonesty, and now it stands like a sad reminder of a broken place.

That plantation ended our day’s trip because I couldn’t forget how quiet and empty it was. On the way back to town, we passed tall, skinny pine trees and a dark pond with trees around it. The air smelled heavy and sweet, like something dead.

White birds with thin legs flew by us, and the bright red cotton flowers looked nice against the green and purple plants. A peasant girl was working in the field, wearing a white turban and with dark skin. We saw all this, but the strange feeling stayed with us.

This land is really strange—full of stories no one has told, full of sadness and joy, and full of the history of people’s lives. It has a sad past but also a hopeful future! This is the Black Belt of Georgia. Dougherty County is at the west end of the Black Belt, and people used to call it the Egypt of the Confederacy. It has lots of history. First, there’s the Swamp on the west, where the Chickasawhatchee River flows slowly south. At its edge lies the shadow of an old plantation, lonely and dark. Then there’s a pool with gray moss hanging down and salty water, surrounded by forests full of wild birds. In one place, the woods are burning slowly, glowing dull red, but no one cares. After that, the swamp becomes beautiful; a raised road built by chained black convicts dips into it, making a path almost covered by green plants. Huge trees grow from thick undergrowth, and dark green shadows fade into a black background, until it’s all one wild, tangled jungle, amazing in its strange and wild beauty.
