For over 100 years, Oxford World’s Classics have helped people enjoy some of the world’s most famous books. Now, there are more than 700 books in the series, from ancient stories made thousands of years ago to popular novels from the 1900s. The series includes both well-known and less famous writings.

At first, the small hardback books had introductions written by famous writers like Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, and Graham Greene. These introductions made reading the books even better.

Today, the series is known for being trustworthy and carefully put together. It covers all kinds of writing, like world literature, plays, poems, religion, philosophy, and politics. Each book has helpful notes and background information to help readers understand the texts better.
