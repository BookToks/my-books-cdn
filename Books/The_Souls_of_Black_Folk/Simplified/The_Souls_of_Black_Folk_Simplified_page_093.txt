What kind of wings must Atalanta have to fly over all these hills and valleys, through gloomy woods and slow rivers, and across the dry, sun-baked land! How fast must she be if she isn’t tempted by gold to disrespect the Sanctuary!

The Sanctuary of our ancestors doesn’t have many gods—some people even say “too few.” There’s Mercury from New England, Pluto from the North, and Ceres from the West. Also, there’s the half-forgotten Apollo from the South, under whose protection the girl ran. But as she ran, she forgot him, just like Venus was forgotten in Bœotia. She forgot the old idea of the Southern gentleman, who was once polite and honorable like knights and nobles. She forgot his good qualities along with his flaws, and instead reached for golden apples—meaning she chose men who were busier, smarter, more careful, and less honest. Golden apples look nice—I remember when I was a kid and orchards full of red and gold fruit tempted me to sneak in. And the merchant who replaced the planter isn’t a bad person. Hard work and money are the powerful forces that will build this new land. Saving and working hard are the paths to new hopes and chances. But we still need a warning so that clever Hippomenes doesn’t fool Atalanta into thinking golden apples are the main goal of the race, instead of just part of the journey.

Atalanta shouldn’t make the South believe that material wealth is the only way to succeed. This dangerous idea is already spreading. It’s replacing the better kind of Southerner with greedy money-chasers. It’s covering up the nicer parts of Southern life with fake shows of wealth. People say money can fix every problem—money to replace the old slave system, money to help poor white people, money to pay Black workers and keep them working, money as the goal of politics, and money as the rule for law and order. And now, instead of teaching Truth, Beauty, and Goodness, schools are teaching that money is the most important thing.

This isn’t just true for the world Atalanta represents, but it’s also starting to affect the world beyond that—the Black World beyond the Veil. Right now, it doesn’t really matter what Black people think or want in the South. Their feelings and ideas are mostly ignored or forgotten. But when they do start to think and act for themselves—and don’t believe anyone who says that day will never come—the things they say won’t be new. They will be the words and ideas they learned when they were children in their community.
