The way these people see life isn’t selfish or petty. Whether at Oxford, Leipsic, Yale, or Columbia, you won’t find a stronger commitment or more freedom to work hard. They want to help all people, both black and white, reach their full potential. Their goal is to find the best in life and to share the idea of sacrifice with others—that’s what they talk and dream about.

In the middle of a place full of strict social rules and deep racial hate, there’s a green spot where anger cools down. Here, the pain of disappointment is eased by hope and learning. People can relax, listen, and imagine a better future. They hear time saying, “You must learn to give up.” The people who started schools like Fisk, Howard, and Atlanta made mistakes, but not the silly ones people laugh about now. They were right to build new education based on universities. After all, where else do we get real knowledge except from deep, broad learning? Like the roots of a tree, universities provide the strong base for everything else, from ancient times all the way to today.

But these founders did mess up by not realizing how big the problem really was. They thought it would only take a few years or decades, so they rushed and didn’t build a strong foundation. They lowered the standards and ended up with some poorly equipped schools that weren’t true universities. They also forgot something important—out of a million black young people, some were meant to be scholars, and some were meant to do manual work. True training means not making everyone a college student or everyone a worker, but helping scholars spread knowledge to those who don’t have it, and helping workers be free and skilled. Trying to turn a blacksmith into a scholar is almost as foolish as trying to make a scholar into a blacksmith—almost, but not quite.
