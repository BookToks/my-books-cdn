Or will you let untrained troublemakers take charge instead of educated men who know how to think? We shouldn’t forget that even though many Black young people face poverty and get discouraged or laughed at by friends, more and more of them want a good education. From 1875 to 1880, 22 Black students graduated from Northern colleges; from 1885 to 1890, 43 graduated; and from 1895 to 1900, nearly 100 graduated. From Southern Black colleges, the numbers were even higher: 143, then 413, and over 500 graduates in those same periods.

This shows a strong desire for learning. If we don’t give this “Talented Tenth” the chance to get knowledge, who really thinks they’ll just give up and be satisfied with low jobs like carrying wood or fetching water?

No. The Black community’s clear and powerful logic will become even louder when the South gets richer and more complex. The South can’t just stay like a scary place that tries to scare Black people into submission.

The South can’t waste energy like that if it wants to catch up with the rest of the world. As Black people become more careful with money and learn new skills, if they aren’t guided wisely, they will keep thinking about past wrongs and the unfair present. This could lead them to want revenge and stop progress. Even now, many Black people see clearly how unfair their situation is and how wrong the system is. You may blame them, but their answers, even if not perfectly argued, have strong truths you can’t ignore, Southern Gentlemen!

If you hate their presence here, they ask, “Who brought us?” When you fear mixed marriages, they say legal marriage is better than the abuse many Black women have faced. And when you blame Black men for crimes against women, they remind you that many Black women were hurt by your own people, breaking your laws, and the evidence is in millions of mixed-race children. Finally, when you say Black people are criminals, they remind you that slavery was the worst crime, and lynching and lawlessness followed it. Being Black or a certain race is not a crime, but that’s what they face constant blame for all over the country.
