The story of the Ninth Crusade hasn’t been written yet. It was a mission that seemed more like a wild dream to us than the quest of St. Louis did to people back then. Behind the ruins and destruction, women in colorful dresses showed courage. After the loud sounds of the guns, the sound of teaching filled the air. Both rich and poor, serious and curious women came. Some had lost their fathers, brothers, or even more family. They wanted to build schools in the South for both white and Black children. They did a great job. In the first year, they taught over one hundred thousand people.

Soon, Congress had to make new decisions about the Freedmen’s Bureau, which had grown fast and become very important. It was almost as hard to end as it was to start. In early 1866, Congress talked about it again. Senator Trumbull from Illinois introduced a bill to make the Bureau bigger and stronger. This time, Congress talked about it much more carefully. The war was over, so people could think more clearly about what freedom really meant. Supporters said the Bureau was still needed to protect freed slaves, to help enforce the Thirteenth Amendment, and to do the right thing for the ex-slaves without costing the government much money. Opponents said the war was done, so the Bureau’s powers were wrong in peacetime. They thought it would upset the South and make freed slaves dependent on help, costing a lot of money. Both sides had strong points: one worried the Bureau’s powers could hurt everyone’s rights, and the other believed the government had to act now or freed slaves would be re-enslaved. The bill finally passed to make the Freedmen’s Bureau bigger and permanent.

President Johnson quickly said no, calling the bill “unconstitutional,” “unnecessary,” and “extrajudicial.” Because of his veto, the bill didn’t pass at first. But the fight between Congress and the President grew worse. Later, a changed version of the bill passed, even though the President vetoed it a second time, on July 16.
