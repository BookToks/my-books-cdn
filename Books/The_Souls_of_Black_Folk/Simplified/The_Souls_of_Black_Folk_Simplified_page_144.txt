All the workers do is provide their labor. The landowner gives the land, animals, tools, seeds, and a house. At the end of the year, the worker gets about one-third to one-half of the crops. But from their share, they have to pay back for food and clothes they were given during the year. This means the worker has no money saved and no real wages, and the employer’s money mostly comes from the workers’ pay. This system doesn’t work well for either side and usually happens on poor land with struggling owners.

Above these workers are many black farmers who work the land on their own and pay rent with cotton. This system seemed good after the war because it gave freed slaves more freedom and a chance to make extra money. But with the crop-lien system, land getting worse, and heavy debt, these farmers ended up working hard but getting almost nothing back. In the past, tenants had some savings or property, but now, because landlords don’t live there, rent keeps going up, and cotton prices go down, most tenants don’t even own their mules anymore. 

The change from worker to tenant happened by setting a fixed rent. If rent was fair, tenants had a reason to work hard. But if rent was too high or the land got worse, it made the black farmers give up trying. This was true in Dougherty County, where landlords and merchants took all the benefits from cotton prices and tenant efforts through high rent and interest. If cotton prices went up, rent went up even more. If prices dropped, rent stayed high or only dropped a little. If a tenant worked hard and grew a big crop, rent went up the next year. If the crop failed, the tenant lost their corn and mule to pay debts. Sometimes landlords were kind, but most of the time, they took as much money as possible from the black farm workers.

The average tenant pays 20 to 30 percent of their crop as rent. This kind of high rent causes bad effects: the land gets ignored and damaged, workers lose motivation, and many feel treated unfairly.
