People like these have inspired and guided the world before, and if we don’t get completely caught up in our own selfishness, they will do it again. We have to respect the hopes of Black people: their deep and powerful experiences, the hidden treasures inside their hearts, and the strange things they’ve seen in life can give the world new ways to see things. Their love, life, and actions are important to everyone. And for themselves, during hard times, the chance to rise above problems is a reward that helps their spirit, even when being Black means facing unfair struggles.

I sit with Shakespeare and he doesn’t mind. I cross the color line and walk arm in arm with Balzac and Dumas, where happy people welcome me in fancy places. From the quiet evening that hangs between the strong earth and the stars, I call Aristotle, Aurelius, or any soul I want, and they come kindly without looking down on me. So, joined with Truth, I live above the Veil. Is this the life you’re jealous of, America? Is this the life you want to change into something ugly and unfair like in Georgia? Are you so scared that, looking from this high place, we might see the Promised Land?
