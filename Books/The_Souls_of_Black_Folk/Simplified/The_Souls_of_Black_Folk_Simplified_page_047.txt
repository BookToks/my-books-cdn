A long time ago, when Black people were enslaved, they believed that one big event would end all their pain and doubts. Few people ever hoped for Freedom as much as Black Americans did for two hundred years. To them, slavery was the worst thing ever, causing all sadness and unfair treatment. They saw Emancipation, or being set free, as the key to a better life, like a beautiful land they dreamed of. In their songs and prayers, they kept saying one word – Liberty. They believed God held Freedom in His hand. Finally, freedom came suddenly, like a dream.

With a wild mix of emotions and violence, the message was clear in their own voices: “Shout, O children! Shout, you’re free! For God has bought your liberty!” Many years have passed since then – ten, twenty, forty years of building a new life. But even now, the dark shadow of problems still sits at the Nation’s table. We cry out to this big social problem, hoping it will change, but it hasn’t. The country is still not free from its mistakes, and freed Black people haven’t found the perfect life they hoped for. Even though some good things happened, a deep sadness stays with Black people because their dream was so big and simple, yet still out of reach.

The first ten years after freedom were just a longer struggle to truly be free, a freedom that always seemed just out of reach – like a ghostly light that teased and confused them. The horrors of war, the violence from groups like the Ku Klux Klan, lies from dishonest leaders, the chaos in work, and mixed advice from friends and enemies left Black people lost, with no new hope except the old call for freedom.
