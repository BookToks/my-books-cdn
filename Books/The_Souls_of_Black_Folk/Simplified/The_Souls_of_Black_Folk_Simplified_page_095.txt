Where has the search for Goodness, Beauty, and Truth in the new world gone? Does Freedom, which grew from the hard work and sacrifice of our ancestors despite the mockery of some young people today, have to turn into just a greedy chase for money or wild desire?

Not all the hills in Atlanta are covered with factories.

On one hill to the west, the sunset shines on three buildings that stand out clearly against the sky. They are beautiful because they fit together simply: a big green lawn rises from the red street with roses and peach trees mixed in; on the north and south sides are two plain but impressive halls; in the middle, partly covered by ivy, is a larger building that looks strong and elegant, with just one small spire. It’s a peaceful place—you don’t expect anything more; everything you need is there and easy to understand.

That’s where I live, and every day I hear the quiet sound of calm life. In winter evenings, when the red sun is setting, I see dark figures walking between the buildings as the night bell rings. In the morning, when the sun shines gold, the loud day bell brings the rush and laughter of three hundred young people from the halls and streets and from the busy city below—children with dark hair—ready to join their clear young voices in morning songs.

They gather in several classrooms: some listen to the love story of Dido, some hear the tale of Troy; others explore the stars, or learn about people and countries; and in other rooms, they follow other trusted ways of understanding this strange world. Nothing new or fast, just old and respected ways of searching for Truth, finding life’s hidden beauty, and learning how to live well. The big question of why we exist is the college lesson that was given to the Pharaohs, taught in Plato’s groves, that formed the basis of old studies, and is now taught to the sons of freedmen at Atlanta University. This course won’t change; its methods will get better and its knowledge deeper thanks to hard work and insight. But the true college will always have one goal—not just to help you make a living, but to help you understand the purpose and meaning of life itself.
