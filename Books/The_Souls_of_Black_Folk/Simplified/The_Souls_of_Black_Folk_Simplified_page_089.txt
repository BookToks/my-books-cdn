I looked through the window carefully and saw things that were more familiar. The blackboard was about two feet bigger, and the seats still didn’t have backs.

The county owns the land now, I heard, and every year there’s a school session. As I sat by the spring and looked at the Old and the New, I felt happy, really happy, but also a little sad. After drinking water twice, I started walking again. There was the big double log house on the corner. I remembered the broken family that used to live there. The strong, tough face of the mother, with wild hair, came to my mind. She had pushed her husband away, and while I was teaching school, a strange, big, cheerful man lived there. People talked about it. I was sure Ben and ’Tildy wouldn’t turn out well from such a home. But life is strange; Ben is now a busy farmer in Smith County, “doing well,” they say, and he took care of little ’Tildy until last spring, when she got married. Ben had a hard life, working hard for food, and people made fun of him because he looked different and was crooked. Then there was Sam Carlon, a rude, stingy old man who had strong ideas about “niggers” and hired Ben for a summer but didn’t pay him. So the hungry boy packed his bags and in the daytime went into Carlon’s cornfield. When the angry farmer attacked him, Ben fought back like an animal. Doc Burke stopped a murder and a lynching that day.

The story made me think about the Burkes again, and I wanted to know who won in their battle, Doc or the seventy-five acres of land. It’s really hard to make a farm from nothing, even in fifteen years. So I walked faster, thinking about the Burkes. They used to be wild and strong in a way I liked. They were never rude or bad, just rough and simple, with a loud, fun way of living that included big laughs, pats on the back, and naps in the corner. I passed the small house of the Neill boys. It was empty, and the boys had grown into lazy farm workers. I saw the Hickmans’ home, but Albert, who had a bent back, had died. Then I came to the Burkes’ gate and looked inside; the yard looked messy and unkept, but the same fences were still around the old farm except on the left, where there were twenty-five more acres. And wow! The small cabin in the hollow had climbed the hill and grown into a half-finished six-room house.

The Burkes owned a hundred acres but still owed money.
