And so the years passed by, summer after summer––until friends moved away, Mom’s hair turned gray, and my sister started working in the Judge’s kitchen. But the saying “When John comes” stayed around. At the Judge’s house, they liked hearing it because they had a John too––a fair-haired, clean-faced boy who spent many long summer days playing with the darker John. Every morning, the Judge, who was big and gray-haired, would say, “John is at Princeton, showing the Yankees what a Southern gentleman can do,” as he walked to the post office. Then he’d come home with his letters and papers. The Judge, his weak wife, his sister, and his growing daughters would read the Princeton letters carefully. “College will make a man of him,” the Judge said. Then he’d ask the shy waitress, “Jennie, how’s your John?” and quietly add, “It’s too bad your mother sent him away––it might spoil him.” Jennie just wondered what he meant.

In that small Southern village, everyone was waiting, kind of without really knowing it, for the two young Johns to come back. They dreamed, without really saying it, about new things those boys would do and new ideas everyone would think about. But it was strange that most people only thought about one John––the black people thought about the black John, and the white people thought about the white John. Neither group really understood what the other was thinking, just a feeling of unease.

At the school in Johnstown, we were confused about John Jones. For a long time, he seemed impossible to teach. He was loud and wild, always laughing and singing, and never able to focus on his work. He didn’t know how to study or be thorough, and with his being late, careless, and always happy, we didn’t know what to do. One night, during a serious meeting, we decided to suspend Jones for the rest of the term because he kept causing trouble and ignoring his work. That seemed to be the first time life felt real to Jones. He looked at the gray-haired Dean with big eyes and said, “Why––why, I haven’t graduated yet!”
