The people shifted nervously in their seats as John stood up to speak. He talked slowly and carefully. He said that the new times needed new ideas; we are very different from the people of the 1600s and 1700s, with bigger ideas about people being connected and having a shared future. Then he talked about the growth of charity and public education, and especially about more wealth and jobs. He wondered quietly, looking at the old ceiling, what role Black people in this country would have in the struggles of the new century. He gave a rough idea of a new Industrial School that might be built among the trees, and spoke more about charity work that could be started, and money that could be saved for banks and businesses. Finally, he asked for unity and said people should stop fighting over religion. “Today,” he said with a smile, “it doesn’t matter if someone is Baptist or Methodist, or even if they don’t belong to a church, as long as they are good and true. Does it matter if someone was baptized in a river or a bowl, or not at all? Let’s stop being so small-minded and think about bigger things.” Then, thinking no more, he slowly sat down. A heavy silence took over the crowded room.

Most people didn’t really understand what he said because he spoke in a strange way, except for the last part about baptism; they knew that and sat quietly while the clock ticked. Then, after a while, a low growl came from the Amen corner, and an old bent man stood up, walked through the seats, and climbed straight onto the pulpit. He was wrinkled and dark-skinned, with some gray, messy hair; his voice and hands shook like he had palsy, but his face showed the strong passion of a religious fanatic. He grabbed the Bible with his big rough hands, raised it twice without speaking, and then suddenly spoke loudly and powerfully. He trembled, swayed, and bent down; then stood tall and proud, while the people moaned, cried, wailed, shouted, and wild screams came from the corners where all the bottled-up feelings exploded into the air. John never really knew what the old man said; he just felt that he was being attacked and blamed for disrespecting true Religion. He was surprised to realize that without meaning to, he had touched something this small world held very sacred. He stood up quietly and walked out into the night. He headed toward the sea, under the flickering starlight, half aware of the girl who followed him shyly. When he finally stood on the cliff, he looked at his little sister sadly, suddenly feeling the pain of how little he had thought about her.
