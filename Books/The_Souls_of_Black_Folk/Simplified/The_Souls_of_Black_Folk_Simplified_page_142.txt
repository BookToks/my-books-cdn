This movement happened between Emancipation and 1880, but it only partly reached its goals. Since 1880, many men have been moving to towns because they were unhappy with the job chances in the Black Belt.

In Dougherty County, Georgia, you can easily see what happened when people stuck together for safety. Only ten percent of the grown-up people were born there, but the Black population is four or five times bigger than the white population. The Black people feel safer because there are so many of them, which protects them from unfair treatment. This makes hundreds of workers stay in Dougherty even though the pay is low and times are hard. But things are changing, and slowly the farm workers are moving to towns and leaving the big farms behind. Why is this?

Why don’t Black people become landowners and build up a community of Black farmers, which many kind people and leaders have hoped for a long time?

To someone who only looks quickly or spends a little time trying to understand the South, the problem with Black farm workers might seem simple. Aunt Ophelia once said they are “shiftless,” meaning lazy. People often notice things like what I saw last summer. We were driving to town late in the day when two young Black guys passed us in a mule cart with a few bushels of loose corn. One was driving, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, looking careless and relaxed. The other was sleeping in the wagon. As we passed, an ear of corn fell off, and they didn’t notice. A little farther on, there was another one on the ground. Between the mule and the town, we counted twenty-six ears of corn on the road. Lazy? Yes, that’s exactly what they looked like.

But if you watch those boys closely, you see they aren’t lazy. The next morning, they’ll be up with the sun. They work hard when they work, and they do it willingly. They don’t care only about money; they don’t try to get rich by being selfish. They might relax in front of you but work honestly behind your back.
