A lot of important people came to the meeting, like the Haitian politician Benito Sylvain, the former slave Henry ‘Box’ Brown, and the African American feminist Anna Julia Cooper. At the last part of the conference in Westminster Town Hall, Du Bois gave a speech called ‘To the Nations of the World’ that started with a powerful paragraph:

In the biggest city of the modern world, at the end of the 1800s, people of African descent gathered to seriously talk about the situation and future of darker-skinned people. The big problem of the 1900s is the problem of the color line. This means deciding how much differences in race will be used to stop more than half the world from having the same chances and rights to enjoy modern life.

In his book The Souls of Black Folk, Du Bois makes it clear that the ‘color line’ isn’t just about racial prejudice in the United States. The phrase also means the relationship between darker and lighter races in Asia, Africa, America, and islands in the sea. For example, in the chapter about Booker T. Washington, Du Bois mentions how the U.S. treated weaker and darker people in places like the West Indies, Hawaii, and the Philippines. This shows that the color line is a global issue. Du Bois asks, ‘Where in the world can we go and be safe from lies and violence?’

This idea of fighting against imperialism, or unfair control over other countries, is an important but quiet theme in The Souls of Black Folk. It became a big part of Du Bois’s work after World War I, especially in books like Darkwater (1920) and Dark Princess (1928). He also talks about this in the introduction to the special edition of The Souls of Black Folk published in 1953.

The literary expert Robert Stepto noticed that Souls has a strong urging or calling tone. The way Du Bois talks to the reader (who he seems to picture as a white American) changes from being polite and kind — like when he says ‘you, Gentle Reader’ — to more serious.
