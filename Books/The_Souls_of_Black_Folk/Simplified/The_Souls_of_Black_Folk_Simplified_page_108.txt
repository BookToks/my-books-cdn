What these millions of people really want isn’t money, but love and understanding—something that comes from the heart. Today, only their own family and community can give them this, but long ago, kind and caring people brought it to them during the 1860s. That was one of the best times in American history, and it wasn’t about greed or showing off.

The teachers at those schools didn’t try to keep Black people down. Instead, they wanted to help them rise out of the terrible conditions caused by slavery. The colleges they started were like homes where the best Black students could connect closely with the good traditions of New England. They lived, ate, studied, worked, hoped, and listened together. Their classes might have seemed old-fashioned, but the real power was in the personal connection between people.

About two thousand Black students have graduated from these schools with bachelor’s degrees. That number shows that too many Black people aren’t getting higher education. In fact, if you look at all Black students in college and high school across the country, the government says we need five times as many as there are now to match the national average.

Fifty years ago, it was hard to prove that many Black students could finish a modern college course. But today, it’s clear because four hundred Black students have earned bachelor’s degrees from top schools like Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, and many others. So, nearly two thousand five hundred Black students have graduated. The big question is: how well did their education prepare them for life?

It’s really hard to find good information about that—hard to contact the graduates, get honest answers, and judge their success fairly. In 1900, a group at Atlanta University studied these graduates and shared what they found. They wanted to know what the graduates were doing and got answers from almost two-thirds of them. The colleges also confirmed these reports, so the information is mostly trustworthy.
