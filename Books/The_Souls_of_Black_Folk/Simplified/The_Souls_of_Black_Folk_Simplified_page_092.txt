All of this is really tough, and many people and cities have used it as an excuse to feel sorry for themselves, to be quiet and sad, and to just wait without doing much.

But those people aren’t strong. The people of Atlanta looked ahead with hope. Their future looked bright and full of promise: Atlanta, the Queen of the cotton world; Atlanta, the Gateway to the sunny South; Atlanta, like Lachesis, who weaves the threads for the whole world. So the city built factories on its hills, filled its shops with clever handmade goods, and built long railroads ready for the busy messenger to come.

The whole country noticed how hard Atlanta was working.

Maybe Atlanta wasn’t named after the fast runner Atalanta from old stories—you know the one, who would only marry a man who could outrun her. Hippomenes tricked her with three golden apples. She ran fast and stopped to look at the apples, but when she got to the last one, he grabbed her. They fell in love, but their passion broke the rules of love, and they were cursed. If Atlanta wasn’t named after Atalanta, it should have been.

Atalanta isn’t the first or last girl whose greed for gold ruined true love. And it’s not just girls—many people, as they grow up, forget their high hopes and start chasing money like gamblers. In America, the idea of working hard is often mixed up with just wanting to get paid a lot. So many people think it’s normal to race after money, and no one really asks if the goal of life should only be to get rich. If that’s America’s problem, it’s even more dangerous for a new city like Atlanta, because if it only cares about money, that money might bring bad luck!

The hard race to succeed didn’t start just for fun. After the War, Atlanta was surrounded by a scary wild place—feudalism, poverty, a rising new class, unfair treatment like serfdom, the return of Law and Order, and above all, the problem of Race. The journey was really tough for everyone, especially those who were tired and worn out.
