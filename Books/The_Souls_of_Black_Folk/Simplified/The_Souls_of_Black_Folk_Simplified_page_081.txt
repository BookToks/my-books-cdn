Mr. Washington made a mistake by not pointing out an important truth. His ideas have made white people, both in the North and South, put the responsibility for solving problems faced by Black people on Black people themselves. They just watch and complain instead of helping. But really, the whole country is responsible, and none of us are innocent if we don’t work hard to fix these big wrongs.

The South should be honest and admit its mistakes. It needs to do what’s right for the Black people it has treated badly and still treats unfairly. The North is also guilty and can’t just feel better by giving money. We can’t fix this problem with smooth talk or just smart plans. If things get worse, can this country’s spirit survive while millions of people are slowly hurt or killed?

Black Americans have an important and difficult job. They need to move forward, even if it means disagreeing with their greatest leader. When Mr. Washington talks about saving money, being patient, and learning useful skills for most people, we should support him. We should be proud of his achievements and leadership. But when he excuses unfair treatment, ignores the importance of voting, downplays the harmful effects of social divisions, or stops smart Black people from aiming higher, we must strongly and peacefully fight against these ideas.

We have to keep pushing for the rights everyone deserves, holding tightly to the important words said by our country's founders: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they are given by their Creator certain rights that can’t be taken away; among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
