Most of the Black Belt land is gone now; only small pieces still belong to the original families, and the rest is owned by Jewish and Black people. Even the land that’s left is mostly mortgaged and worked by tenants. Here’s one tenant now—a tall brown man who works hard and drinks a lot. He can’t read or write but knows a lot about farming, as his healthy crops show. This new, simple board house is his, and he just moved out of an old, moss-covered cabin with only one room.

From the curtains in Benton’s house down the road, a dark, attractive face watches us because cars don’t come by often here. Benton is a smart light-skinned Black man with a big family. He takes care of a plantation damaged by the war and now run by a widow. People say he could be rich, but he parties too much in Albany. The sad feeling of neglect, caused by the land itself, seems to hang over these fields. Long ago, there were cotton gins and machines here, but now they have all rotted away.

The whole area looks lonely and forgotten. These are the last parts of the huge plantations once owned by the Sheldons, Pellots, and Rensons, but those times are gone. Their houses are falling apart or gone, fences are missing, and the families have moved away. The old owners had tough times. Over there are the big fields of Bildad Reasor; he died during the war, and his overseer quickly married the widow. Then the overseer left, and so did the neighbors. Now only the Black tenant stays, but the owner’s relative or creditor is far away, still demanding rent without mercy. Because of this, the land is poorly kept and poor.

Only Black tenants can handle this kind of system, and only because they have to. We’ve ridden ten miles today and haven’t seen a single white person.

A heavy feeling of sadness slowly comes over us, even though the sun is bright and the cotton plants are green. This is the Cotton Kingdom now—a shadow of a great dream. So, who is the king? Maybe it’s the hard-working farmer, sweating over his eighty acres with just two skinny mules, fighting a tough battle with debt. We sit quietly thinking until, as we turn a corner on the sandy road, a nicer sight appears—a neat little house close to the road, and a small store nearby. A tall, tanned man stands up from the porch when we greet him and comes over to our carriage.
