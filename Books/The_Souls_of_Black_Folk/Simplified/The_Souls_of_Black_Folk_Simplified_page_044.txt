All night long, the water keeps calling to me.

The water never rests, and I won’t either, not until the last moon fades and the last tide stops. Until the end of everything starts to burn in the west. My heart will feel tired and confused, crying like the sea does all night long. Life feels like it’s always crying without anyone hearing, just like the water calling to me all night.

There’s always a question between me and the other world that no one asks out loud. Some don’t ask because they’re too polite; others don’t know how to say it right. But everyone thinks about it. They come close to me, looking curious or kind, but instead of asking directly, “How does it feel to be a problem?” they say things like, “I know a great black guy in my town,” or “I fought in a battle,” or “Don’t these bad things in the South make you angry?” I smile or listen or calm down my anger, depending on the moment. But when it comes to the real question, “How does it feel to be a problem?” I rarely say anything.

Still, being a problem is a weird feeling, especially for someone who’s never been anything else, except maybe as a baby or when I was in Europe. It’s during the early, fun days of being a kid that I first noticed it all at once. I remember clearly when that feeling first hit me. I was just a little kid, living in the hills of New England, where the dark Housatonic River flows between the mountains down to the sea.
