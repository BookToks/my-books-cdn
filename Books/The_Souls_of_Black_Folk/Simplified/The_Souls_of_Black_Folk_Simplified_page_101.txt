Finally, there’s a deeper, darker thought that comes up—the confused, half-aware voices of Black and white people crying out, “Liberty, Freedom, Opportunity—please, proud World, give us a real chance to live!” But behind this hope is a doubt—what if the World is right and we aren’t truly equal? What if this strong feeling inside is all wrong, just a false hope?

So here we are, caught between ideas of people coming together, even through things like conquest and slavery; the idea that Black people are somehow less, even if that’s because of lies; and a desperate shout for freedom from people who aren’t even sure they have the right to ask for it. This is the confusing mix of thoughts we have to deal with when figuring out how to prepare people for life.

Even though this situation is strange and interesting to both wise people and casual observers, it holds hidden dangers that make us uneasy. It’s clear that what the world looks for in faraway deserts we already have nearby—a strong, hardworking group of people who can handle the climate. If we ignore these people and don’t help them grow, we risk becoming poor and losing out. But if, driven by cruel doubts, we treat this group badly, using them selfishly like before, what will stop our country from falling apart? Only a smarter kind of selfishness, taught by education, can help everyone find their rights through hard work.

We can complain about the South’s color prejudice, but it’s a real problem. Strange, stubborn ways of thinking exist and must be faced seriously. We can’t just laugh at them, fight them all the time, or change them quickly with laws. But we also can’t ignore them.

We have to accept these problems as real but unpleasant facts that block progress in civilization, religion, and basic kindness.

The only way to deal with them is by widening human understanding, by having open minds and appreciating different cultures. Also, the natural hopes and dreams of people—even if they are Black, behind in some ways, or rough around the edges—must be treated carefully. Encouraging weak and unprepared minds without guidance is dangerous, and ignoring their efforts will only bring more crime and laziness right to us.
