Once we crossed a dark, quiet stream, where the sad trees and twisting vines, all shining bright yellow and green, looked like a huge cathedral made of wild wood.

As I crossed, I seemed to see again a fierce tragedy from seventy years ago. Osceola, a leader who was part Indian and part Negro, had risen in the swamps of Florida, promising revenge. His war-cry reached the red Creeks of Dougherty, and their war-cry echoed from the Chattahoochee River all the way to the sea. Men, women, and children ran away or were killed as they rushed into Dougherty. In the shadows, dark and scary painted warriors moved quietly—one after another—until three hundred of them had snuck into the dangerous swamp. Then, the sticky slime closing around them called the white men from the east.

Waist-deep in water, they fought under the tall trees until the war-cry stopped and the Indians slipped back to the west. No wonder the woods are red.

Later came the black slaves. Day after day, the sound of chained feet marching from Virginia and Carolina to Georgia filled these rich swamp lands. Day after day, the songs of the careless, the cries of motherless children, and the angry whispers of the miserable echoed from the Flint to the Chickasawhatchee rivers. By 1860, West Dougherty had built perhaps the richest slave empire the modern world ever saw. One hundred and fifty wealthy landowners controlled the work of nearly six thousand Negroes, running farms with ninety thousand acres of planted land, worth three million dollars even when the soil was cheap. Every year, twenty thousand bales of cotton were sent to England and other places. Men who once lost everything came here to make money and get rich. In just ten years, cotton production grew four times bigger, and the land’s value tripled. It was the peak of the new rich, and the masters lived a life of careless luxury. Fancy horses pulled their carriages to town; they were open and fun-loving hosts. Parks and groves full of flowers and vines were made, and in the middle stood the big, wide “big house” with its porch, columns, and huge fireplaces.

But even with all this, there was something ugly and forced about it—a kind of restless, crazy feeling; because wasn’t all this fancy stuff built on pain? “This land was a little Hell,” a ragged, brown, serious-faced man told me.
