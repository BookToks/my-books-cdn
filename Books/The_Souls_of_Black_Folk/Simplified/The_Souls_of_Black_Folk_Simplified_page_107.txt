We should remember that most Americans have already made up their minds about Black people without really thinking, and the least we can do is listen to the facts.

People who support higher education for Black students admit that the current system isn’t perfect. Too many schools try to do college-level work, but sometimes they don’t do it well. They often focus on having more schools instead of making sure the education is good. But this is true for colleges everywhere, not just for Black students. This doesn’t change the important question about whether Black people deserve higher education.

The only way to answer this question is by looking closely at the facts. If we ignore schools that haven’t actually graduated students with education higher than high school, and focus on the thirty-four real colleges, we can clear up many misunderstandings by asking: What kind of schools are these? What do they teach? And what kind of graduates do they have?

First, we can say that these colleges, like Atlanta, Fisk, Howard, Wilberforce, Lincoln, Biddle, and Shaw, are special and almost one of a kind. As I write, I see a big rock from New England covering a grave, placed there by graduates of Atlanta University. It has words thanking their old teacher and friend for his selfless life and hard work so that they and their future generations could be blessed. This was New England’s gift to freed Black people: not money or charity, but friendship and strong character.
