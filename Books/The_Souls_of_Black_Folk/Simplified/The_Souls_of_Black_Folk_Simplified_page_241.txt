Machines and long work processes have changed the jobs of carpenters, ironworkers, and shoemakers a lot. Today, a really good worker needs to be smart and have good technical training, along with basic school education, and maybe even more advanced schooling.

Because of this, industrial schools grew and created separate Trade Schools to train better skilled workers. At the same time, they kept simpler trade lessons for general education. This split between Trade Schools and manual training followed the trend of education today.

A well-known teacher says that in Sweden, manual training was first seen as a way to help working-class kids earn a living. But over time, people realized manual training is more important. It helps kids grow morally, physically, and mentally, not just learn a job.

So, good teachers in Trade and manual training schools need higher education themselves now. It used to be that any old carpenter could teach at a trade school, but not anymore. Schools like Tuskegee want teachers with college degrees. 

For example, Mr. Booker T. Washington works with helpers who went to top colleges like Harvard, Oberlin, and Smith. Some know Greek, Latin, math, science, and history. His team includes people who studied classics and sciences in college, and they help him do important work. 

Still, some of Mr. Washington’s ideas made people question if such training is really good for Black people, even though his team shows it is.

Men of America, the problem is clear. Black people were brought here unfairly by your ancestors. Like it or not, millions are here now and will stay. If you don’t help them rise up, they might bring everyone down. Education and work are the tools to lift a whole people up.
