Some big questions about how people can improve themselves and the world are still mysteries that science hasn’t solved.

Why did Æschylus write plays two thousand years before Shakespeare? Why did civilization grow strong in Europe but rise and fall in Africa? As long as the world stays silent about these questions, should this country admit it doesn’t know and treat unfairly those who brought powerful Black songs to places of power?

The Souls of Black Folk has been called an ‘orchestrated’ text. This means music plays an important symbolic role in the book. It also refers to what a critic named Vilashini Cooppan calls Du Bois’s ‘dialectical formalism,’ which means the book is built like a conversation between ideas.

Throughout the book, from the first quotes to the last words, The Souls of Black Folk mixes opposing ideas like a back-and-forth. A clear example is in Chapter VI, ‘Of the Training of Black Men,’ where Du Bois talks about how modern ideas started during the slave trade, long ago.

He explains that three main ways of thinking have come down to us. First, the idea that all people should work together worldwide because culture makes us want more things, and everyone—Black, yellow, or white—should help each other. But this idea is challenged by the fact that history shows more unfairness, using power and control instead of fairness.

Second is the idea of racism—the belief that Black people are less than human—but this is answered by a hopeful idea that some Black people might be able to prove themselves equal.

Third is the demand by African Americans for equal rights and chances, but this hope is sometimes shaken by doubts and feelings of inferiority: what if the world’s negative view is actually true?

These three ways of thinking create a confusing mix that Du Bois says we must figure out to prepare people for life.
