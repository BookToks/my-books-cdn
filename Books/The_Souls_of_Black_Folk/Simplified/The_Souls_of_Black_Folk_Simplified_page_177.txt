Who has forgotten?

You have forgotten, summer swallow, but the world will end when I forget.

A little yellow paper fluttered into my room one brown October morning and said, “Unto you a child is born.” Then I felt scared about becoming a dad but also happy about creating life. I wondered what the baby looked like and felt like—what its eyes were like, and how its hair curled. I thought about my wife—she had gone through so much to bring our baby into the world while I was just thinking about it.

I ran to my wife and baby, saying to myself, “Wife and child? Wife and child?” I ran faster than a boat or steam car, but I still had to wait for them. I left the noisy city and the flickering sea behind and went to my quiet Berkshire Hills that watch over Massachusetts.

I ran up the stairs to my pale wife and crying baby, to the place where a new life had been given to save a life—and it did. What is this tiny, strange thing, this new baby’s cry from a world I don’t know—so much head and voice? I held it carefully and watched it blink, breathe, and sneeze. I didn’t love it yet; it seemed funny to love something so small. But I loved her, my girl-mom, who now looked like the morning sun—changed and glowing.
