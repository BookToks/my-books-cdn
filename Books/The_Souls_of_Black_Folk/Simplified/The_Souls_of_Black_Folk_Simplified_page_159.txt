Public schools, more than homes, can help train good citizens who respect themselves.

Lately, people have been talking a lot about trade schools and higher education, so the poor condition of public schools in the South has been mostly ignored. In Georgia, for every five dollars spent on public education, four go to white schools and only one to Black schools. Even the white schools, except in cities, are not good and really need fixing. If the white schools are so bad, imagine how the Black schools are doing. I’m starting to believe the national government will have to step in and help with public education soon. Right now, only the hard work of thoughtful people in the South has stopped the Black school funding from being cut even more in some states. But this fight isn’t over; in many places, it’s getting stronger. What can this country expect from people who get poor education, face tough economic struggles, have no political rights, and barely enough school resources? The answer is crime and hopelessness, with only a few determined people fighting back, hoping the country will wake up someday.

So far, I’ve talked about the physical, economic, and political relationships between Black and white people in the South, including crime and education. But beyond these clear facts, there’s something else very important to understand about the South. It’s the feeling, the atmosphere, the small everyday actions that together make up life there. In any place, these small things are hard to explain but are key to truly understanding how people live. This is especially true in the South, where for a generation there has been deep emotional struggle, strong feelings, and complicated spirits, even if you don’t see it in history books or laws.
