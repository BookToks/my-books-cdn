Some people see the progress of Black people as a threat, while others—usually the children of white slave owners—want to help them improve. The general public has allowed this second group to keep Black schools open and to protect Black people somewhat in their property, safety, and lives.

Because of the influence of rich people, Black people are at risk of being pushed back into a kind of slavery, especially in rural areas. Workers and educated people who are afraid of Black people have joined together to take away their voting rights, and some have even suggested sending them away. Also, angry and uneducated people can be easily stirred up to attack or lynch any Black man.

Praising all these complicated feelings and ideas is silly. Blaming the entire South is unfair. But it is smart and necessary for thoughtful Black men to praise good leaders like Governor Aycock, criticize people like Senator Morgan, argue with writers such as Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, and call out bad leaders like Senator Ben Tillman.

It would be wrong not to admit that Mr. Washington has sometimes stood against unfair treatment of Black people in the South. He sent petitions to stop bad laws in Louisiana and Alabama, spoke out against lynching, and has used his influence to fight against harmful plans and events.

Still, the main idea behind Mr. Washington’s message is this: First, the South is right to treat Black people the way it does because Black people are seen as degraded; second, Black people’s slow progress is mainly because of bad education in the past; and third, Black people’s future improvement depends mostly on their own hard work. These ideas are partly true but also dangerous if we forget other important facts.

We must remember: slavery and racial prejudice are strong reasons for Black people’s situation; industrial and basic education took time to develop because Black teachers needed training first, and without schools like Tuskegee, which didn’t exist before 1880, progress was hard; and while it’s true that Black people must work hard for themselves, they also need support and encouragement from richer and wiser people around them to really succeed.
