The way people work and the size of their homes often cause families to break apart. When kids grow up, they leave to work on farms or move to the city. Sisters might go to work as servants. Because of this, many families have lots of babies and new couples, but not many families have older kids living at home.

The average size of Black families has gotten smaller since the war, mostly because money is tight. In Russia, many young people get married before they turn twenty, and it was the same for Black people before the war. But now, very few boys and only about one in five girls under twenty are married. Young men usually marry between 25 and 35, and young women between 20 and 30.

This delay happens because it’s hard to make enough money to raise a family. In country areas, this often leads to problems with sexual behavior. But it’s not usually prostitution or having babies out of wedlock, as some might think. Instead, it often means couples live apart or leave each other after starting a family. There are about 35 separated people for every 1,000, which is a lot. Some of these women are actually widows, and some separations aren’t permanent. Still, this is the biggest moral problem.

There is very little prostitution among Black people, and most families, based on house-to-house studies, are decent and respect women’s purity. Their ideas might not fit with places like New England, and some habits are loose, but the rate of babies born out of wedlock is lower than in Austria or Italy. Most women are modest. The main problem is that it’s easy to get married and easy to separate.

This isn’t a new thing or caused by Emancipation. It comes from slavery times. Back then, Sam and Mary would live together with the master’s permission but no formal marriage. If the master needed Sam to work somewhere else or decided to sell him, their life together was broken up quickly. It even helped the master if both Sam and Mary found new partners.
