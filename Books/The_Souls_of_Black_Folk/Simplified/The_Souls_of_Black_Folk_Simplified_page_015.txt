Du Bois wanted Black people to become fully aware of themselves and to bring together their two sides into one true self. In his book The Souls of Black Folk, he talks about the “double life” that Black Americans live, feeling torn between two worlds. This idea, called double consciousness, means they can’t see themselves clearly except through how others see them. But it’s also a kind of special ability—it gives them a deeper understanding of the complicated American world.

This idea shows that feeling separated or different can actually be powerful if you think about it carefully and use it to make change. Du Bois hoped that one day, these divided feelings would come together to form a better and truer self. Then, Black people could fully join in and help build culture.

The book’s title shows a change from old ideas about race, which were based on science ideas from the 1800s, to new spiritual ideas from German thinkers. As one expert said, Du Bois mixed ideas from German philosophers and strong voices like Sojourner Truth. Instead of just trying to keep races “the same,” Du Bois argued that schools in the South should teach big ideas and true culture to save the soul from selfish and small-minded thoughts.

Another important idea in the book is the “color-line,” which Du Bois called the main problem of the 20th century. He first said this in 1900 at a big meeting of Black leaders from around the world. This color-line means the division between Black and white people that causes many problems.
