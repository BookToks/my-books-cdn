I see the hot, white roads slowly going up and down and twisting ahead of me under the hot July sun. I feel really tired in my heart and body as I see ten, eight, six miles stretching out without stopping. My heart feels heavy when I hear people ask, “Got a teacher? Yes,” over and over again. So I kept walking—horses were too expensive—until I had gone past the train tracks and stagecoach routes to a land full of wild animals and rattlesnakes. Here, a stranger was a big deal, and people lived and died near one blue hill.

Scattered over the hills and valleys were cabins and farmhouses, hidden from the world by forests and rolling hills to the east.

At last, I found a small school. Josie told me about it. She was a thin, plain girl of twenty, with dark brown skin and thick, tough hair. I had crossed the stream at Watertown and rested under big willow trees. Then I went to the little cabin where Josie was resting on her way to town. The skinny farmer welcomed me, and Josie, hearing why I was there, said they wanted a school over the hill. She said only one teacher had been there since the war and that she really wanted to learn. She talked fast and loud, full of energy and hope.

The next morning, I walked over the tall, round hill, stayed a bit to look at the blue and yellow mountains stretching toward the Carolinas, then walked through the woods and arrived at Josie’s home. It was a plain house with four rooms, sitting just below the top of the hill among peach trees. The father was quiet and simple, not rude but very unaware of many things. The mother was different—strong, busy, and full of energy, talking fast and wanting to live “like normal people.” There were many children. Two boys had left already. The rest were two growing girls, a shy little girl of eight, John who was tall and awkward at eighteen, Jim who was younger, quicker, and better looking, and two babies who were too young to say how old. Then there was Josie herself. She seemed to be the heart of the family, always busy helping at home or picking berries. She was a bit nervous and sometimes scolded like her mother but was also loyal like her father. She had a special kindness about her, a quiet kind of bravery that would give everything to make life better and fuller for her family. I spent a lot of time with this family later and grew to love them for trying hard to be good and comfortable and for knowing they didn’t know everything.
