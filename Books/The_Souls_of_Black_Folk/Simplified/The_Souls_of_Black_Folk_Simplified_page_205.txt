By a lucky chance, the Negro folk-song—the rhythmic cry of the slave—is now not just the only true American music, but also the most beautiful way people have shown their feelings here in America. It was ignored, sometimes looked down on, and often misunderstood. But still, it remains the special spiritual treasure of the nation and the greatest gift from the Negro people.

Back in the 1830s, the melody of these slave songs touched the whole country, but soon many people forgot them. Some songs, like “Near the lake where drooped the willow,” became popular tunes, but people forgot where they came from. Others were made fun of on “minstrel” shows and then lost their meaning. During the war, there was a unique event called the Port Royal experiment after the capture of Hilton Head. For possibly the first time, people from the North and South met the Southern slaves face to face and heart to heart without anyone else in between. The Sea Islands of the Carolinas had black people who were less influenced by the outside world than others. They looked different, spoke in a funny way, but their hearts were real and their singing moved people deeply. Thomas Wentworth Higginson quickly told others about these songs, and Miss McKim and others shared their rare beauty. But the world only half believed them until the Fisk Jubilee Singers sang these slave songs so powerfully that the world could never forget them.

There was once a blacksmith’s son born in Cadiz, New York. Over time, he taught school in Ohio and helped defend Cincinnati from Kirby Smith. Then he fought in the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg and later worked in the Freedman’s Bureau in Nashville. In 1866, he started a Sunday school class for black children, singing with them and teaching them to sing. Then they taught him to sing too. When George L. White felt the deep power of the Jubilee songs in his soul, he knew his life’s mission was to let these Negroes share their songs with the world as they had shared with him.

So in 1871, the Fisk Jubilee Singers’ journey began. They traveled north to Cincinnati—four boys and five women, all dressed simply—led by a man with a strong goal. They stopped at Wilberforce, the oldest school for Negroes, where a black bishop gave them a blessing.
