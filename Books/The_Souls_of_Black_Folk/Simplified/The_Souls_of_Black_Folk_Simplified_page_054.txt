A month later, Congress seriously called for Black soldiers to join the army. Before, the law from July 1862 had only let them enlist reluctantly. Now, the barriers were gone, and it happened for real. Lots of runaway slaves started coming in, and army officers worried: "What should we do with these slaves who come almost every day? Should we find food and shelter for their women and kids?"

A man named Pierce from Boston helped figure out what to do. He became kind of the founder of the Freedmen’s Bureau. He was a good friend of Secretary Chase. In 1861, when the Treasury had to take care of slaves and abandoned lands, Pierce was chosen to study the situation. First, he helped refugees at Fortress Monroe. Then, after Sherman took Hilton Head, Pierce went there to start his Port Royal experiment, trying to turn slaves into free workers.

But before his experiment really got going, the problem of runaway slaves got so big that the Treasury Department couldn’t handle it anymore. The army took over. Groups of freedmen started gathering at places like Fortress Monroe, Washington, New Orleans, Vicksburg, Corinth, Columbus in Kentucky, Cairo in Illinois, and Port Royal.

Army chaplains found new work here, and more “superintendents of contrabands” appeared. They tried to organize things by getting strong men to work and finding jobs for others.

Then came the Freedmen’s Aid societies, which started because of heartbreaking calls for help from Pierce and others. There was the American Missionary Association, which grew out of the Amistad case and was ready to help. Many church groups, the National Freedmen’s Relief Association, the American Freedmen’s Union, the Western Freedmen’s Aid Commission, and about fifty other groups sent clothes, money, school books, and teachers to the South. All this help was really needed because the freedmen were often reported to be in terrible poverty, and things were getting worse, not better.

Every day, it became clearer this wasn’t just a short-term problem but a big national crisis. There was a huge labor problem. Many Black people had no jobs, or if they worked sometimes, they didn’t always get paid. And if they did get paid, they often spent the money without thinking.
