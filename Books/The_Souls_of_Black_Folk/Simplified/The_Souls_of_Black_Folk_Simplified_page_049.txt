He knew he was poor; he had no money, no home, no land, no tools, and no savings. Yet, he had to compete with neighbors who were rich, owned land, and had skills. Being poor is tough, but being poor as part of a whole race struggling in a land full of money is even harder. He felt how much he didn’t know—not just about reading and writing, but about life, business, and culture. Years of laziness and avoiding hard work had tied his hands and feet.

His problems weren’t just about poverty and not knowing things. Because of two hundred years of unfair laws against Black women, his race was marked by the shame of being born outside of marriage. This wasn’t just about losing old African values but also about carrying the damage caused by white men who had hurt Black families, almost destroying the Black home.

A group of people with so many challenges shouldn’t be forced to compete with the rest of the world. Instead, they should be allowed to focus all their energy on fixing their own social problems. But sadly, while experts count the number of Black children born out of wedlock and the number of Black prostitutes, the heart and soul of hardworking Black people are filled with deep sadness.

People call this sadness "prejudice" and say it’s just culture protecting itself from ignorance and crime, or the “higher” races protecting themselves from the “lower” races. The Black man agrees when the prejudice is about respecting culture, learning, and goodness, and he quietly accepts it. But he feels lost and almost speechless when he faces the kind of prejudice that goes beyond all that—when he is personally disrespected, mocked, and humiliated; when facts are twisted and lies are spread; when people ignore the good and celebrate the bad; when there is a strong desire to hate everything Black, from heroes like Toussaint to even the devil.

This kind of hatred makes him feel sick and hopeless, something that would stop and discourage any other group—except the Black people, who never learn the word “discouragement.”

But facing such strong prejudice leads to self-doubt, putting oneself down, and lowering hopes—things that always happen when people are treated badly and hated. Rumors and warnings spread everywhere: Look out!
