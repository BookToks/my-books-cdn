Sometimes, we really hope that all these differences will disappear someday; but right now, the world is the way it is. This was the feeling of hopelessness, and the young man fought against it hard. Like a serious shadow, he moved past those places, asking, arguing, and sometimes angrily demanding to be let in, until finally he was told no; people pushed him away, thinking he was foolish, unreasonable, and rebellious against God’s rules.

Then, the bright and beautiful vision slowly disappeared, leaving behind a gray and harsh world filled with sadness.

Even the kind hands reaching out to him from the dull morning seemed like part of the dark shadows. He looked at them coldly and asked, “Why should I try so hard when the world is closed to me?” Still, the hands kept encouraging him—the hands of young John Jay, the brave son of a brave father; the hands of the good people of Boston, a city of freedom. And even when the path to becoming a priest was finally open to him, the sadness stayed; even when the respected Bishop raised his arms over the Black deacon at old St. Paul’s church, the heavy feeling didn’t leave his heart, because something beautiful had been lost from the world.

But the hard trials Alexander Crummell went through were not wasted. Slowly and seriously, he began to plan his life again. He looked carefully at the situation. Deep beneath the slavery and suffering of Black people, he saw their biggest problems, made worse by many years of mistreatment. The lack of strong morals and unshakable rightness was their main weakness, and this is where he decided to start. He wanted to bring together the best of his people in a small Episcopal church and lead, teach, and inspire them until the change spread, until the children grew, until the world listened, until—until—and then, in his dream, he saw a faint glow of that first bright vision from his youth—just a faint glow, because something beautiful had been lost from the world.

One day—it was 1842, and spring was fighting happily with the May winds of New England—he finally stood in his own church in Providence as a priest. The days passed quickly, and the serious young clergyman worked hard; he wrote his sermons carefully; he said his prayers with a soft, sincere voice; he walked the streets talking to people; he visited the sick and prayed beside those who were dying.
