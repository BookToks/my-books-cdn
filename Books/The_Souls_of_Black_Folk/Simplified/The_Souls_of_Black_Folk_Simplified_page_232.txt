One-fourth of the time is spent studying Latin and Greek; one-fifth on English and modern languages; one-sixth on history and social science; one-seventh on natural science; one-eighth on math, and one-eighth on philosophy and teaching.

Besides these students in the South, Black students have gone to Northern colleges for many years. As early as 1826, one Black student graduated from Bowdoin College. Since then, almost every year, other Black students have graduated from different schools. They have faced a lot of racism. Fifty years ago, very few colleges would let them in. Even today, no Black student has ever been admitted to Princeton, and at some other top schools, they are barely accepted.

Oberlin College was the first to really work on ending racial segregation in colleges and has more Black graduates than any other Northern school.

By 1899, the total number of Black college graduates was:  
At Black colleges: 1,914  
At White colleges: 390  
Before 1876: 137 Black, 75 White  
1875–80: 143 Black, 22 White  
1880–85: 250 Black, 31 White  
1885–90: 413 Black, 43 White  
1890–95: 465 Black, 66 White  
1895–99: 475 Black, 88 White  
Class unknown: 57 Black, 64 White  
Of these graduates, 2,079 were men and 252 were women.

About half of the Northern-born Black college men go South to work with their communities, even though it is hard and they give up a lot. Almost 90% of Black graduates born in the South don’t leave. Instead, they stay and work among their family and neighbors.

The most important question about college-educated Black people is: Do they find jobs? Some people have suggested that higher education for Black people has led to graduates who can’t find work that fits their skills.
