 In addition to these students in the South, Negroes have attended Northern colleges for many years. As early as 1826 one was graduated from Bowdoin College,* and from that time till to-day nearly every year has seen elsewhere, other such graduates. They have, of course, met much color prejudice. Fifty years ago very few colleges would admit them at all. Even to-day no Negro has ever been admitted to Princeton, and at some other leading institutions they are rather endured than encouraged.
 
 Oberlin was the great pioneer in the work of blotting out the color line in colleges, and has more Negro graduates by far than any other Northern college.
 
 The total number of Negro college graduates up to 1899, (several of the graduates of that year not being reported), was as follows: Negro Colleges White Colleges Before ’76 137 75 ’75–80 143 22 ’80–85 250 31 ’85–90 413 43 ’90–95 465 66 ’95–99 475 88 Class Unknown 57 64 Total 1,914 390 Of these graduates 2,079 were men and 252 were women; 50 per cent.
 
 of Northern-born college men come South to work among the masses of their people, at a sacrifice which few people realize; nearly 90 per cent. of the Southern-born graduates instead of seeking that personal freedom and broader intellectual atmosphere which their training has led them, in some degree, to conceive, stay and labor and wait in the midst of their black neighbors and relatives.
 
 The most interesting question, and in many respects the crucial question, to be asked concerning college-bred Negroes, is: Do they earn a living? It has been intimated more than once that the higher training of Negroes has resulted in sending into the world of work, men who could 196 Appendix II find nothing to do suitable to their talents.
