But for these men to really make a difference, they need some power. They must have the support of most people in their communities and be able to use the tools that history shows are necessary for progress.

One of the most important tools today is the power to vote. This leads me to talk about the third way white and black people in the South connected—through politics.

The way Americans thought about Black people voting shows how they saw government. In the 1850s, people still remembered the ideas from the French Revolution and believed everyone should have the right to vote. They thought no group was perfect enough to decide everything for others. Instead, they believed that the best people to decide what’s good for them are those who are affected. So, giving everyone the chance to vote was the best way to help the most people.

Sure, some people had problems with this idea. If someone said voters were uneducated, the answer was to teach them. If they said voters were dishonest, the answer was to stop them from voting or punish them. And if people were afraid of leaders who might trick voters, the answer was that experience would teach everyone in time.

At this time, the question came up about Black people voting in the South. Here was a group of people who had just been freed and had no protection. How could they be kept safe from those who didn’t want them to be free? The North said not by force. The South said not by government help. So, the answer was voting—the only fair and true defense for free people, said the common sense of the country.
