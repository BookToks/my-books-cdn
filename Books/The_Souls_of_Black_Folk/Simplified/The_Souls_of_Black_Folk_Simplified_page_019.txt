Du Bois talks about a different kind of scholar here. He calls this person both a ‘student’ and a ‘social seer,’ meaning someone who learns from close experiences and then uses that knowledge to help make public policies.

When The Souls of Black Folk came out in 1903, people mostly noticed how Du Bois criticized Booker T. Washington. Washington was a former slave who became very famous as the founder of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Chapter III, called ‘Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others,’ is a longer version of a review Du Bois wrote in 1901 about Washington’s autobiography. 

This chapter, and the whole book to some extent, was the first time Du Bois spoke for a group of Black people who didn’t agree with Washington. Before, they had stayed quiet partly because Washington’s ‘Tuskegee Machine’ was so powerful in Black politics back then. Du Bois called this group the ‘Talented Tenth.’ These were educated Black people who wanted to improve their community by fighting for civil rights, supporting higher education, and gaining political power.

Du Bois only uses the phrase ‘Talented Tenth’ once in the book, but the whole book is kind of like their statement. It matches an essay Du Bois wrote the same year praising this ‘aristocracy of the race.’ At the time, people saw it that way too. For example, Jessie Fauset, a teacher and later novelist, wrote Du Bois a thank-you letter saying they needed someone to explain the complicated struggles of educated Black men and women.

While Du Bois’s critique of Booker T. Washington and his push for higher education are very strong, there is also a clear idea that a small group of leaders should guide the way forward.
