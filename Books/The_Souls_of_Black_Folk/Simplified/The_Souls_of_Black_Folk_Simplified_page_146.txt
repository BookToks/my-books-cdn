If there were any Black landowners back then—and there might have been a few—their land was probably held in the name of a white person. This was a common way to own land during slavery. In 1875, Black people owned about 750 acres of land. Ten years later, this grew to over 6,500 acres, then 9,000 acres in 1890, and 10,000 acres in 1900. The total value of their property went up from $80,000 in 1875 to $240,000 in 1900.

Two things made it hard to understand this growth clearly: the economic crash of 1893 and the low price of cotton in 1898. Also, the way property was taxed in Georgia’s rural areas was old-fashioned and not very reliable. There were no official assessors; each person reported their own property value to the tax collector. This meant the numbers could change a lot from year to year because people might report differently. These facts show that Black people had very little saved money, so their property depended a lot on good economic times. They didn’t have much to get through tough years and were more affected by cotton prices than white people were. Because of this, many Black landowners didn’t keep their land for long. Some lost it and became renters again, while new people bought land. In 1898, out of one hundred Black landowners, half had bought land since 1893, a quarter between 1890 and 1893, a fifth between 1884 and 1890, and the rest before 1884. In total, 185 Black people had owned land in the county since 1875.

If all the Black landowners who ever had land had kept it or passed it on to other Black people, they would own closer to 30,000 acres instead of the 15,000 acres they had. Still, owning 15,000 acres is impressive and shows the value and ability of Black people. If they had started out with money and support after slavery, in a rich and fair community, then this amount of land might seem small. But for a few thousand poor and uneducated farm workers, facing poverty, falling cotton prices, and social problems, saving and building up $200,000 in one generation was a huge achievement.
