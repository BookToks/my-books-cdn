At first, I didn’t have enough material for a book. I planned to do a social study that would sum up the work of the Atlanta Conferences or be a scientific investigation. But they asked if I had some essays to put together and publish right away, mentioning my articles in the Atlantic Monthly and other places. I was unsure because books made of essays usually don’t do well. Still, I gathered some of my scattered pieces.

Even after the book became successful, Du Bois felt concerned about the ‘considerable, perhaps too great, diversity’ of the selections. As historian Herbert Aptheker said, Du Bois was being too modest about the hard work he put into preparing *Souls*. First, he carefully revised the essays he had published before, sometimes changing them so much that they hardly looked like the originals. Second, he added a lot of new material while revising and included new chapters like ‘Of the Wings of Atalanta’, ‘Of the Passing of the First-Born’, ‘Of Alexander Crummell’, ‘Of the Coming of John’, and ‘The Sorrow Songs’, which he wrote just for *The Souls of Black Folk*.

In the ‘Forethought’, Du Bois calls the sections ‘chapters’ instead of just essays to show how much work he put into the book. Each chapter was carefully ‘cut, polished, and mounted with a jeweler’s precision’. Every chapter has its role in the book, which Du Bois explains in the ‘Forethought’. 

The first chapter, ‘Of Our Spiritual Strivings’, sets the mood for the whole book. It talks about the ongoing struggle of African American life after the Civil War. People wanted to be part of modern culture, but racism kept blocking them behind what Du Bois calls a ‘Veil’ of prejudice. The next chapter, ‘Of the Dawn of Freedom’, continues this idea by telling the story of the Freedmen’s Bureau, the US government’s failed attempt to help freed slaves.
