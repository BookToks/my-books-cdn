Georgia is not just where most Black people live, but it has also been the center of many problems involving Black people, both now and in the past. No other state in the country has a million Black citizens—about as many as all the slaves in the whole country in 1800. No other state worked so hard and for so long to bring so many Africans here. Oglethorpe* thought slavery was against the law and religion, but the people who first settled Georgia didn’t really care much about rules against rum and slaves. Even though the leaders tried to stop it, Georgians ignored the rules. The judges were easy to convince, smuggling was common, and Whitefield* prayed hard for slavery. By the middle of the 1700s, all the rules were gone, and the slave trade continued happily for over fifty years.

In Darien, where the Delegal riots* happened a few years ago, the Scottish Highlanders often spoke out against slavery. The Moravians of Ebenezea* also didn’t like it. But the slave trade didn’t slow down until the Haitian Revolution led by Toussaint* scared people. Even then, the national law of 1808* wasn’t enough to stop it. Africans kept coming in huge numbers—fifty thousand between 1790 and 1810, and then smugglers and people from Virginia brought in two thousand more every year for many years. So the Black population in Georgia grew fast: from 30,000 in 1790 to over 100,000 in 1810, 200,000 in 1820, and half a million by the time of the war. The Black population kept growing like a snake moving upward.

But let’s keep moving. The land we pass after leaving Atlanta used to belong to the Cherokee, a brave Native American nation that fought hard to keep their homeland. Sadly, the U.S. government forced them to move west of the Mississippi River. If you want to ride with me, you have to get into the “Jim Crow Car.” It’s okay—four white men and a little white girl with her nurse are already there. Usually, races mix in that car, but the white car is only for white people. Of course, this car isn’t as nice as the other one, but it’s still clean and comfortable.
