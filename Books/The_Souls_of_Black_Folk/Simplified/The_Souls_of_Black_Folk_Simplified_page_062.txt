The people working for the Bureau were very different from each other. Some were kind and wanted to help, while others were selfish, nosy, or even thieves. Most were better than the worst ones, but the bad ones still caused problems.

In the middle of all this was the freed slave, confused about who was a friend and who was an enemy. He had just escaped slavery—not the worst kind, because sometimes there was kindness and happiness—but still slavery, which treated black people like animals. The freed slaves knew that many white people in the South had fought hard to keep slavery going. They were happy to be free and scared of their old masters who wanted to keep them as slaves. They turned to the people who freed them, even though those people sometimes used them to force the South to obey. This made the gap between black and white people in the South even bigger. It was sad but also something that couldn’t be avoided. On one side were the North, the government, the carpetbaggers, and the freed slaves. On the other side were all the white people in the South—rich or poor, good or bad, some criminals and some heroes.

Because feelings were so strong, it’s hard to write about this time calmly. Two people stand out as symbols of those days. One was an old white man whose family had fought in the war, who hated the end of slavery because he believed it would cause terrible problems for everyone. He ended his life broken and full of hate. The other was a strong black woman who had once been scared of her white masters, cared for their children, and suffered great pain. She had been forced to obey and had a mixed-race son who was killed by violent men who hated black people.
