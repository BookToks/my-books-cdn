Every night, there was one dark figure who always hurried last and late toward the bright lights of Swain Hall—because Jones was never on time. He was tall and skinny, with brown skin and thick hair, and looked like he was growing out of his clothes. He walked with a kind of awkward roll. He used to make everyone laugh quietly in the dining room when he sneaked to his seat after the bell for prayers had rung; he seemed so clumsy. But one look at his face made people forgive him—his big, friendly smile showed he was genuinely happy and kind.

He came from Altamaha, far down in Southeastern Georgia, where old oak trees grow, and the sea meets the sandy shores that sometimes disappear underwater, leaving only small islands. The white people in Altamaha thought John was a good boy—he was a strong farm worker, good at working in the rice fields, helpful everywhere, and always polite and friendly. But when his mother wanted to send him to school, they shook their heads. “It’ll spoil him, ruin him,” they said, like they really knew. But many black people proudly saw him off at the station, carrying his small trunk and many bags. They shook his hand, the girls kissed him shyly, and the boys patted him on the back. Then the train came. He hugged his little sister, wrapped his big arms around his mother, and left with a loud puff and roar into the big, bright world waiting for him. The train passed Savannah with its parks and palm trees, went through cotton fields and the dark night, until they reached the busy town of Johnstown by morning.

The people who stayed behind in Altamaha that morning, watching the train take their friend, brother, and son away, kept saying, “When John comes.” They dreamed of parties, church speeches, new furniture in the front room—or even a new front room itself. They hoped for a new schoolhouse with John as the teacher, and maybe even a big wedding—all this and more—“when John comes.” But the white people just shook their heads.

At first, John planned to come back at Christmas, but the break was too short. Then he hoped for the next summer, but times were tough and school was expensive, so instead, he worked in Johnstown.
