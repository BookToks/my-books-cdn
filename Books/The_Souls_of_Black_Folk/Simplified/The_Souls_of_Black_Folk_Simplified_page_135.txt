This tradition that has lasted for two hundred years hasn’t disappeared in the last thirty years. Today, Sam’s grandson lives with a woman without getting a marriage license or having a wedding. They live together honestly and respectfully and are basically like husband and wife. Sometimes they stay together until one of them dies. But often, fights in the family, wanting to leave, someone else interested, or just struggling to support a family cause them to split up, breaking the household. The Black church has worked hard to stop this, and now most marriages are done by pastors.

Still, the problem is very deep, and only improving living conditions will really fix it.

Looking at the Black people in the county as a whole, most are poor and don’t have much education. About ten percent are doing well and are good workers, while around nine percent behave badly. The rest, over eighty percent, are poor and not well educated, mostly honest and trying their best, but sometimes careless and with some casual attitudes about relationships. These groups can change depending on things like the price of cotton. It’s hard to explain just how much they don’t know. For example, nearly two-thirds cannot read or write. But that only shows part of it. They don’t understand much about the world, how the economy works, how government functions, or what their own value and chances are—things slavery kept them from learning. Many things that come naturally to white kids are confusing problems for Black kids when they grow up. America doesn’t give all its kids the same chances.

It’s easy to get lost in details when trying to understand a large group of people. We forget that every person is a living, feeling human being.

They may be poor and uneducated, Black and different in their ways and thoughts; but they love and hate, work hard and get tired, laugh and cry their deep tears, and look with hope and fear at the hard life ahead—just like you and me. Most aren’t lazy; they are careless and don’t plan well. They want to take a break from boring work by visiting the big city on Saturdays. They have their troublemakers, but most of them work steadily and honestly for a living, even when conditions are tough and most other workers wouldn’t keep going as they do.
