Then the soft and powerful sounds of Black music floated and roared.

I called my small community a world because it felt so separate. Still, we shared a kind of half-awake feeling, growing from common happiness and sadness at funerals, births, or weddings; from shared struggles with poverty, bad land, and low pay; and most of all, from seeing the Veil that stood between us and Opportunity. All this made us think some thoughts together, but when we spoke, we used different languages.

Those whose eyes had seen “the glory of the coming of the Lord” more than twenty-five years ago believed that every problem or help was part of a dark fate that would fix things in God’s time. Most people who remembered slavery only from childhood found the world confusing: it asked little from them, they gave little back, and yet the world made fun of what they offered.

They couldn’t understand this strange situation, so they became lazy, careless, or acted tough without thinking. But some—like Josie, Jim, and Ben—knew about War, Hell, and Slavery only from childhood stories. Their young minds were sharpened by school, stories, and half-formed ideas. They couldn’t be happy, born outside the World. Their weak wings beat against walls made by class, youth, and life; and in risky moments, against anything blocking even their smallest wish.

The ten years after youth—the years when you first realize life is pushing you forward—passed after I left my little school. When those years ended, I happened to go back to Fisk University, to the chapel full of music. While I stayed there, happy and sad to see old friends, I suddenly wanted to cross the blue hill again, to see the homes and school from old times, and find out how life had treated my students; so I went.

Josie was dead, and her gray-haired mother said simply, “We’ve had a lot of trouble since you left.” I was worried about Jim.

With a well-educated family and social status, Jim might have become a bold merchant or a West Point cadet. But there he was, angry at life and careless; and when Farmer Durham accused him of stealing wheat, the old man had to ride fast to get away from the stones the angry fool threw at him.
