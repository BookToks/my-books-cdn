Introduction xi

This book talks about how to improve the lives of former slaves during the Reconstruction era. Chapter III, called ‘Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others’, criticizes the ideas of the most powerful black leader of that time, especially his focus on teaching industrial skills to black people in the South.

The next two chapters take the reader ‘inside and outside the Veil’. One shows black rural life in Tennessee, based on Du Bois’s own experience as a college student who taught school there for two summers. The other looks at Atlanta and warns against the obsession with money: ‘Atlanta must not lead the South to think that wealth is the only way to be successful’ (p. 56).

Chapter VI, ‘Of the Training of Black Men’, stresses Du Bois’s main point about how important higher education is. He supports black colleges and universities that teach liberal arts, not just trade skills like Washington wanted, to help uplift the black community.

The next three chapters are full of details and real stories from African Americans in Dougherty County, Georgia. They show how debt, racism, and segregation hurt black people living in the ‘Black Belt’ of the South.

Chapters X to XII explore deeper parts of black life ‘within the Veil’. ‘Of the Faith of the Fathers’ talks about how important the black church is, calling it the ‘first Afro-American institution’ and the ‘expression of the inner ethical life of a people’ (pp. 132,133). In ‘Of the Passing of the First-Born’, Du Bois writes a touching tribute to his own baby son who died from diphtheria in 1899, showing this as a part of a wider black ‘human sorrow’. Chapter XII shares the life story of Alexander Crummell, a 19th-century black thinker who influenced Du Bois a lot.

The Souls of Black Folk ends with a short story, ‘Of the Coming of John’, which sadly repeats the themes from Chapters VI and IX. It also includes a powerful explanation of the Negro spirituals or ‘Sorrow Songs’, which Du Bois sees as the highest achievement in American culture.

One way to understand how much Du Bois changed his ideas when writing Souls is to compare the first chapter, ‘Of Our Spiritual Strivings’, with his speech ‘The Conservation of Races’, found in the Appendix I of this edition. ‘The Conservation of Races’ was given in March 1897 at the first meeting of the American Negro Academy, a group started by Crummell to promote black scholarship. In August that same year, Du Bois published ‘Strivings of the Negro People’, the essay he later rewrote to become the first chapter of Souls.
