We were sitting near a blacksmith shop by the road, and behind it was the empty, broken-down house of a rich owner. “I’ve seen Black people drop dead in the fields, but they were just pushed aside, and the plow kept going. And in the guard-house, that’s where the blood was.” When things start like this, the whole system will eventually fall apart.

The owners moved to cities like Macon and Augusta, leaving only careless overseers to watch the land. The result is this mess at the Lloyd “home-place”: big oak trees, a lawn, myrtle and chestnut trees all wild and messy; a single gate post where a grand entrance used to be; an old rusty anvil lying in the broken blacksmith shop; a big old house, now dirty and worn, filled with grandchildren of the slaves who once worked there. The owner’s family has shrunk to two women living in Macon, living off what’s left of their old estate. We ride on past empty gates and falling houses, past farms that once thrived, now falling apart, even where an old white woman sits alone, surrounded by miles of Black workers, riding to town in her old carriage every day.

This was really the Egypt of the Confederacy—the rich farming area where potatoes, corn, and cotton were sent to hungry Confederate soldiers fighting for a cause lost before the war even started. It was a safe place for families, money, and slaves. But even then, the land was being ruined. The red clay soil was starting to show through the good topsoil. The harder the slaves were pushed, the worse the farming became. Then came war, the end of slavery, and the confusing time of Reconstruction. Now, what is this Egypt of the Confederacy, and what does it mean for the country’s future?

It’s a place full of sharp differences and mixed feelings of hope and pain. Here, a pretty light-skinned girl just got married last week, hiding her bare feet. Her dark-skinned husband is working in the field, hoeing to support her for only thirty cents a day, without food or a place to stay.

Nearby is Gatesby, a tall, brown man who owns two thousand acres that he worked hard to get and keep. He has a store run by his Black son, a blacksmith shop, and a cotton gin. Five miles away is a town in the Black Belt owned and run by a white man from New England.
