xiv The Sorrow Songs  
I walk through the graveyard to lay this body down. I know when the moon rises, I know when the stars come out. I walk in the moonlight, I walk in the starlight. I’ll lie in the grave and stretch out my arms. I’ll go to judgment at the end of the day, and my soul and your soul will meet then, when I lay this body down.

Negro Song.  
People who lived in darkness sang songs long ago—Sorrow Songs—because they were tired and sad inside. So before each idea I wrote in this book, I put a phrase from these old songs that felt like echoes. These songs were how the black slaves spoke from their souls to the world. Since I was a kid, these songs have touched me deeply. They came from the South, and even though I didn’t know them at first, I felt they were a part of me and my people. Later, when I went to Nashville, I saw a big building made from these songs, standing tall over the white city. To me, Jubilee Hall seemed built from the songs themselves, and its bricks were stained with the blood and dust of hard work. From these songs came wonderful music all day long, full of the voices of my brothers and sisters and the voices of the past.

America hasn’t given the world much beauty except the wild, natural greatness God put in her land. The people here have shown their spirit more in strength and cleverness than in beauty.
