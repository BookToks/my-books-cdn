I have seen a Black farmer owe money to a white store owner, and that store owner go to the farmer’s land and take everything that could be sold—mules, plows, stored crops, tools, furniture, bedding, clocks, mirrors—and do it all without any legal papers, without a sheriff or officer, even though the law should protect some of these things. The store owner didn’t have to explain or show proof to anyone. This kind of thing can happen anywhere where poor workers, especially because of their race, are ignored and left out of kindness and support. As long as the best people in a community don’t feel responsible for helping the weaker ones, these bad people will keep taking advantage of them.

This bad money situation doesn’t mean that no progress is happening in the Black South, or that there aren’t some Black landowners and workers who are doing well and becoming good citizens. But it does mean that there aren’t as many successful people as there could be if things were fairer. Those who do succeed have a harder time and don’t get as far as they should. Also, the people who make it aren’t chosen in a smart or fair way, but mostly by luck.

To fix this, there is only one way. We have to accept that race prejudice in the South is real—very harmful and unfair, but something that only time can change. We can’t expect most white people to take close, caring leadership of Black people right now or for a long time. This kind of leadership and guidance needs to come from Black people themselves. In the past, some people doubted if Black people could create such leaders, but today almost no one questions that individual Black people can learn modern culture and common sense, and teach it to others.

If that’s true, then this is the way to get out of the bad economic situation. There is a strong need for trained Black leaders who are smart and trustworthy—men with skills, knowledge, and good character. These leaders should be educated, successful in business, and teachers of culture. They need to fully understand modern life and be able to lead Black communities by setting a good example, showing kindness, and inspiring people who share the same history and goals.
