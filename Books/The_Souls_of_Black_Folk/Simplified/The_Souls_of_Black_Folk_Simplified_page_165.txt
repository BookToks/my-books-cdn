Beauty, the sad face of Beauty, Mystery, Wonder—what do these dreams mean to silly, babbling men who cry with little sounds under the huge thunder of time, which turns everything to dust, just tiny dust?

Fiona Macleod.* It happened out in the countryside, far from home, far from where I lived, on a dark Sunday night. The road twisted from our big log house along a rocky creek bed, past fields of wheat and corn, until we could barely hear a rhythmic song across the fields—soft, exciting, strong, that rose and fell sadly in our ears.

I was a country schoolteacher then, new from the East, and had never seen a Southern Black revival before. Sure, we in Berkshire were maybe not as strict and formal as people used to be in Suffolk a long time ago; but we were still very quiet and calm. I don’t know what would have happened on those clear Sunday mornings if someone had shouted a wild scream during the sermon or shouted “Amen!” loudly during the long prayer! So, what surprised me most as I got closer to the village and the small church on the hill was how excited the crowd of Black people was. There was a kind of hidden fear in the air that seemed to grab us—a madness, like being possessed, that made the song and words feel very real and powerful.
