Ex-slaves started to earn some money by working in the army and getting paid as soldiers. They used this money to buy land and start businesses. At first, it was hard for them to get their soldier pay because many didn’t understand the system, and some payments were mixed up since soldiers from different places got confused. Because of this, Congress gave the job of paying them to the Freedmen’s Bureau in 1867. In two years, the Bureau gave out six million dollars to five thousand people, and later the total amount was over eight million dollars. Even though there was some cheating, the money helped poor people get started, and some of it was used wisely.

The hardest and least successful part of the Bureau’s work was handling legal cases. Their court had one person representing the employer, one for the Black person, and one from the Bureau. If the Bureau had been completely fair, this could have worked well over time. But because of how the Bureau worked and who was involved, it often sided with Black people, which caused some unfairness and problems. On the other hand, leaving Black people to be judged by Southern courts wasn’t an option. The South was still in chaos after slavery ended. It was really hard to stop strong people from abusing weaker ones, and to keep weak people from taking advantage of the situation too. Former slave owners were ordered around, arrested, and punished by army officers. Meanwhile, former slaves were scared, hurt, and killed by angry people. The Bureau’s courts mostly punished white people, while regular courts mostly kept Black people under control like slaves.

Many laws were made to keep Black people as workers without freedom, almost like slaves of the state. Bureau officials sometimes tried to give freedmen more power than they were ready for. It’s easy for people today to say what should have been done, but it was a really tough time for those who lived through it.
