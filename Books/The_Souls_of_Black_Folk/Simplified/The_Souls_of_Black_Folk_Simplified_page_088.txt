They told Jim to run away, but he didn’t want to. The police officer came that afternoon. Josie felt really sad, and awkward John walked nine miles every day just to see his little brother through the bars of Lebanon jail. Finally, the two boys got back together one dark night. Their mother made dinner, Josie gave all her money, and the boys quietly left.

Josie got thinner and quieter but worked even harder. The hill was too steep for their old dad to climb, and with the boys gone, there wasn’t much to do in the valley. Josie helped sell the old farm, and they moved closer to town. Their brother Dennis, a carpenter, built a new six-room house. Josie worked a whole year in Nashville and saved ninety dollars to buy things to make the house feel like home.

When spring came, with birds singing and the stream full of water, little sister Lizzie, bold and careless, made a mistake because of her youth and brought home a baby without a father. Josie felt scared and kept working, thinking about how their school days were gone. Her face looked tired and pale. She kept working until one summer day when someone else got married; then Josie went to her mother like a hurt child and slept—and never woke up.

I stopped to smell the fresh air as I entered the valley. The Lawrences are gone—father and son forever—and the other son now lazily works the land to survive. A new young widow rents their cabin to fat Reuben. Reuben is a Baptist preacher now, but I think he’s still as lazy as before, even though his cabin has three rooms. Little Ella has grown up strong and is working hard plowing corn on the hot hillside. There are lots of babies and one girl who isn’t quite right in the head. Across the valley, there’s a house I hadn’t seen before. There, I found one of my old students, Uncle Bird Dowell’s daughter, rocking one baby and expecting another. She looked a little worried about her new responsibilities but soon became proud as she showed off her clean cabin and talked about her hardworking husband, their horse and cow, and the farm they planned to buy.

My old log schoolhouse was gone. In its place stood something called Progress; and I heard Progress is usually not very pretty. The old stones that held up my little cabin were still there, and nearby, on six tired-looking boulders, sat a small wooden house about twenty by thirty feet with three windows and a door that locked.

Some of the window glass was broken, and part of an old iron stove lay sadly under the house.
