Du Bois uses music from different sources in his work, but he doesn’t include the actual lyrics of the spirituals. These lyrics often support the ideas in his chapters. For example, Booker T. Washington’s hope for a better future matches the idea of salvation in the song ‘A Great Camp-Meeting in the Promised Land.’ Similarly, the strong push for education in ‘Of the Training of Black Men’ is reflected in the powerful words of the song ‘March On.’ Du Bois might leave out the lyrics to show there’s still a barrier for readers to fully understand the deeper feelings and struggles “within the Veil,” a hidden world of knowledge and effort that’s hard to reach using only white culture’s tools, like European musical notation.

Even though the spirituals are often sad songs, they also give hope. They show a belief in fairness and justice eventually coming, which is also about hope for a better place beyond the “Veil.” This idea appears many times in The Souls of Black Folk, like when Du Bois says he feels connected to Shakespeare without any problems, or when he talks about his son who died but is free from the limits of race. Because the music holds this hope, ‘The Sorrow Songs’ ends with a strong statement against the unfair pride people have in judging others. It warns that many people wrongly think some races are beyond help and don’t deserve saving. This is a proud mistake that ignores history and the hard work people have done. We still don’t fully understand what progress really means or how fast change happens in human lives.  

Du Bois mainly used musical transcriptions by Theodore F. Seward from old sources like books about the Jubilee Singers and collections of religious folk songs sung at places like Hampton Institute. These sources helped him bring the music into his work.
