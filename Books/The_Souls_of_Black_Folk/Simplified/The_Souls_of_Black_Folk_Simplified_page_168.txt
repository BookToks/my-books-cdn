Different groups meet here—like the main church, Sunday school, a few insurance clubs, women’s groups, secret groups, and big meetings. They also have fun events, dinners, and talks besides the five or six regular church services each week.

A lot of money is collected and spent here. People who don’t have jobs find work, visitors are welcomed, news is shared, and help is given to those in need. At the same time, this place is a strong religious center.

Ideas like sin, being saved, heaven, hell, and punishment are talked about twice every Sunday with a lot of passion. Every year, after the farming season ends, there are special religious meetings where many people change their lives. The church also helps keep people’s morals strong, supports family life, and decides what is right and wrong.

So, you can see that the Black church is like a small version of the bigger world that often excludes Black people because of racism and social problems. In big city churches, you see this even more. A big church like Bethel in Philadelphia has over eleven hundred members, a building that fits fifteen hundred people and is worth a lot of money, a yearly budget of five thousand dollars, and a group of leaders including the pastor, other preachers, boards for different jobs, and many smaller groups. This church does a lot and the bishops who lead these churches are some of the most powerful Black leaders everywhere.

These churches are like governments made up of people. If you look closer, you’ll find that in the South, almost every Black American belongs to a church. Some may not be officially counted or don’t always go to services, but for this group, the church is their main social place. In 1890, there were nearly twenty-four thousand Black churches in the country with over half a million members—that means about ten church members for every twenty-eight people, and in some Southern states, one in every two people belonged to a church.
