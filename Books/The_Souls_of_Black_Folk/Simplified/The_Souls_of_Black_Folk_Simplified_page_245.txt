Several times I wanted to update this book to match my current thoughts and to respond to critics. But I hesitated and finally decided to leave the book just as it was first printed, as a record of what I thought and felt in 1903. I planned to explain any changes in other books.

In this special Jubilee Edition, I stuck to that choice. My ideas from fifty years ago appear just as I originally wrote them. I only made a few small changes in words or phrases, not to change my original meaning, but to make sure people today don’t misunderstand what I meant back then.

As I read these old writings again, I notice two things I didn’t include before because I didn’t know or realize them: one is the influence of Freud and his team in psychology, and the other is the huge impact Karl Marx has had on the modern world.

I had studied James, Santayana, and Royce, so I was somewhat ready for the big changes in psychology in the 20th century. But when it comes to the souls of Black people, my ideas didn’t fully understand the role of unconscious thoughts and the power of habits in building and keeping race prejudice.

My college education didn’t completely ignore Karl Marx. He was talked about at Harvard and studied in Berlin. It wasn’t that he was left out, but my teachers didn’t give enough attention or fully understand the big changes in thinking and action that Marx represented. So maybe I can finish this look back by saying: I still believe that the color-line is a major problem of this century. But now I see more clearly that behind the problem of race and color is an even bigger issue. That issue is that many people in civilized societies are happy to live comfortably even if it means most others suffer from poverty, ignorance, and disease. To keep this comfort, people have fought wars, and these wars have become almost constant. Often, the excuse for these wars is still about color and race.
