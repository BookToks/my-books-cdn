At first, the rituals of the slaves started to seem Christian because of their contact with religious leaders and their practical reasons for adopting these practices. After many generations, the Negro church became truly Christian.

There are two important things to know about this church.

First, it became mostly Baptist and Methodist in belief. Second, as a social group, the church existed long before the typical Negro family with just one husband and wife. The church began on plantations and was made up of many separate groups. Even though later people could move around more, the church stayed mostly local. This helped spread the Baptist faith, which was very democratic and spread out, among the slaves. The act of baptism was especially meaningful to their spiritual feelings. Today, the Baptist Church still has the most African American members, about one and a half million. The next most popular churches are those connected to nearby white churches, mainly Baptist and Methodist, with some Episcopalian and others. Methodists are the second largest group, with nearly a million members. These two groups fit well with the slave churches because they focus a lot on strong religious feelings. Other churches had fewer Black members, but Episcopalians and Presbyterians are growing among educated people, and the Catholic Church is growing in some areas. After slavery ended, and even before in the North, Black churches mostly broke away from white churches, either by choice or because they had to. Baptist churches became independent, but the Methodists had to join together for leadership reasons. This led to big Black churches like the African Methodist Church, the Zion Church, and the Colored Methodist, plus other Black church groups.

The second point, that the Negro church existed before the typical Negro family, helps explain some strange things about this community and its membersâ€™ behavior.

Most of all, it shows that the church is a special way that the people express their deep moral and spiritual life, which is rare to see in other places.
