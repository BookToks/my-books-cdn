EXPLANATORY NOTES

2 [dedication]: The book is dedicated to Du Bois’s children, Burghardt Gomer (born on October 2, 1897) and Nina Yolande (born on October 21, 1900). Du Bois calls his son ‘the Lost’ because Burghardt died from diphtheria on May 24, 1899, in Atlanta. This sad event is talked about in Chapter XI, ‘Of the Passing of the First-Born’.

7 Arthur Symons: The quote at the beginning comes from The Crying of Waters (1903) by Arthur Symons. The music that follows is part of a traditional Negro spiritual called ‘Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen’. A scholar named Eric Sundquist said that Du Bois used music from two important collections of spiritual songs from the 1800s, sometimes changing them a little. These collections were by J. B. T. Marsh and by Armstrong and Helen W. Ludlow, arranged by Thomas P. Fenner. You can read more about this in Sundquist’s work, ‘Swing Low: The Souls of Black Folk’.

Mechanicsville: This is a place in Virginia where an important Civil War battle happened in June 1862. It is also called the battle of Beaver Dam Creek.

8 born with a veil ... second-sight: In African American folk stories, it’s believed that babies born with a caul (a thin covering over their face when they are born) have special powers to see the future or have psychic abilities.

10 ‘Shout, O children! ... liberty!’: This is a line from the Negro spiritual ‘Shout, O Children!’ The next line, ‘Take any shape ... tremble!’, comes from Shakespeare’s play Macbeth, Act 3, Scene 4.

11 revolution of 1876: The 1876 presidential election was disputed in three states—Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina. These states supported Democrat Samuel J. Tilden over Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. Some Southern Democrats even threatened to leave the United States. The dispute ended with a deal: Hayes became president, and the North agreed not to interfere with the rights of freed slaves anymore, which ended the Reconstruction period.

12 Toussaint: Toussaint L’Ouverture (1746–1803) was the leader of the Haitian Revolution. During this revolution, enslaved people fought and won against French rule and Napoleon’s army.

15 Lowell: The quote at the beginning comes from The Present Crisis (1844) by James Russell Lowell.
