The cotton looked tall and healthy, and we said nice things about it. He bowed low, almost all the way to the ground, with a serious look that seemed a little strange. Then he said, “My mule died last week,” which was a big problem around here, like a huge fire in town. “But a white man lent me another one.” Then he looked at us and said, “Oh, I get along with white folks.” We changed the subject. We asked about bears and deer, and he said, “Yes, there were some,” and told us brave hunting stories from the swamp. We left him standing in the road, watching us but not really noticing.

The Whistle place, which included his land, was bought soon after the war by an English company called the “Dixie Cotton and Corn Company.” Their manager showed off a lot, with servants and a fancy carriage with six horses. But the company went bankrupt soon after. No one lives in the old house now, but a man comes from the North each winter to collect high rent. I don’t know which is sadder—the empty old houses or the homes of the masters’ children. Behind those white doors are sad stories of poverty, struggle, and disappointment. The war of 1863 was terrible; people who were rich in the morning were often poor by night.

Poor people and rude business people took over, and their kids got lost. Look at that sad-looking house with its cabins, fences, and healthy crops. It doesn’t feel happy inside. Last month, the son who left to the city asked his struggling father for money. But where could the money come from? So the son got up at night, killed his baby and his wife, and then killed himself. And life just went on.

I remember turning a corner in the road next to a pretty forest and a singing stream. A long, low house faced us, with a porch and big pillars, a strong oak door, and a wide lawn shining in the evening sun. But the windows were broken, the pillars were eaten by bugs, and the moss-covered roof was falling apart. I looked inside through the open door and saw the word “Welcome” written on the wall in faded, cheerful letters. The northwest part of Dougherty County is very different from the southwest. It has serious oak and pine trees but none of the lush, almost tropical feel of the southwest.
