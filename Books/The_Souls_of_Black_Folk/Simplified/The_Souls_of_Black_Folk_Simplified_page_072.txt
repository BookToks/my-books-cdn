Booker T. Washington started with very little but achieved a lot. Now, people can honestly talk about both his mistakes and successes without being seen as jealous or picky. It’s important to remember that it’s easier to do things wrong than right in the world.

The criticism Washington faced wasn’t always fair. In the South, he had to be very careful because he was dealing with a very sensitive topic. Once, when he mentioned racism hurting the South at a big event, and another time when he ate dinner with President Roosevelt, people in the South got very angry and almost stopped liking him. In the North, some people thought his advice to accept unfair treatment ignored what being strong and proud really means, and that his ideas about education were too limited.

Most of the time, people didn’t openly criticize him, but some who cared about education and freedom before Tuskegee didn’t think his schools were the only way or the best way. Even though he faced criticism, most people in the country were ready to let him handle a tough problem and said, “If this is all you want, go ahead.” But among Black people, Washington faced the strongest and longest opposition. Some of this was jealousy or anger from others who felt left out. But many educated Black men felt sad and worried about how popular some of Washington’s ideas had become. They respected his honest efforts and worked with him when they could. It’s impressive that, despite facing so many different opinions and problems, Washington still kept the respect of most people.
