First, about where people live. In almost every Southern town, you can usually draw a line on the map that shows where white people live on one side and Black people live on the other. The shape of this line is different in different places. In some towns, a straight line down the middle of the main street separates most whites from most Blacks. In other towns, white neighborhoods are surrounded by a wide area where Black people live. Sometimes small Black neighborhoods pop up inside mostly white areas. In cities, each street usually belongs to one race, and it’s rare to see them living very close together. Even in the countryside, this separation happens in smaller areas, like in the larger Black Belt region.

This separation by race is different from how people naturally group by social status everywhere. A Black slum might be very close to a white neighborhood, and it’s common to find a white slum in the middle of a mostly Black area. But one thing hardly ever happens: the best white people and the best Black people almost never live close to each other. So, in most Southern towns and cities, both races mostly see the worst sides of each other. This is very different from the past, when the best of both races lived close together in big houses, like masters and their house servants, and the hard, dirty work of field hands was hidden from the family’s view. It’s easy to understand why someone who only saw slavery from their father’s nice house and now sees freedom in the busy streets of a city might not understand the whole situation. Also, many Black people believe that Southern white people don’t have Black people’s best interests in mind, and this feeling has grown because the better-off Black people often see the worst behavior from some white people every day.

Now, about how the races are connected through money and work, this is a topic many people have studied, talked about, and tried to help with.
