Booker T. Washington and Others 37 leadership but the one motive of revolt and revenge,––typified in the terrible Maroons, the Danish blacks, and Cato of Stono,* and veiling all the Americas in fear of insurrection.

In the late 1700s, things started to change. People began to think about getting along better between black and white, and some hoped for a future where they could live together as equals.

This hope showed up in songs by Phyllis, the brave death of Attucks, the fights led by Salem and Poor, the smart work of Banneker and Derham, and the political efforts of the Cuffes.*

After the war, money problems and social difficulties made people less hopeful. Black people grew frustrated because slavery and unfair treatment were still around.

This frustration led to two kinds of reactions. In the South, slaves, inspired by rumors of a big revolt in Haiti, tried three times to rebel: in 1800 with Gabriel in Virginia, in 1822 with Vesey in Carolina, and in 1831 with Nat Turner in Virginia.*

In the North, free black people started something different. Because white churches wouldn’t accept them, they left and made their own group called the African Church.* This church grew strong and still has over a million members today.

Walker’s strong words* against what was happening showed how things were changing after the cotton-gin was invented. By 1830, slavery seemed stuck in the South, and slaves were forced to obey.

Free black people in the North, inspired by mixed-race immigrants from the West Indies, began to change what they wanted. They accepted that slaves were enslaved, but they said they were free and wanted to be treated like everyone else.

So, people like Forten and Purvis from Philadelphia, Shad from Wilmington, Du Bois from New Haven, Barbadoes from Boston,* and others worked hard as free men, not slaves, and called themselves “people of color,” not “Negroes.”

But most people didn’t accept them. They were still seen as the same as all black people who were looked down upon, and they had to fight hard to keep rights like voting, working, and moving freely.

Some thought about moving away or starting new colonies, but they didn’t want that. In the end, they joined the Abolition movement, hoping it would bring real change.
