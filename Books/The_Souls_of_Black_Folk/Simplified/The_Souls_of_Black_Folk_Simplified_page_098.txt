Why not start places to learn and live deeply and forever, like colleges, that every year send out a few white and black people who are well-educated, open-minded, and skilled? These people could work together and help bring peace between races.

Patience, kindness, good manners, and taste, along with regular schools, kindergartens, and technical schools, come from knowledge and culture, which come from universities. This is how people and nations should grow, not the other way around.

It’s smart to teach workers how to work, especially for German boys and American girls, but even more important for Black boys because they have less experience and no one to teach them.

It’s also important to teach thinkers how to think carefully, especially now when people don’t think clearly. Those with the hardest lives need the best training to think right. So, it’s silly to ask what the best education is for one person or millions.

Should we teach them trades or liberal arts? Both. Teach workers how to work well and thinkers how to think well. Make carpenters good carpenters, philosophers good philosophers, and fools just fools. But don’t stop there. We are training groups of people, not just individuals. The goal isn’t just to make a bricklayer or a psychologist, but a complete person.

To make complete people, we need big, pure, and inspiring goals—not just making money. Workers should take pride in their work, not just work for pay. Thinkers should seek truth, not fame. This comes from hard work and constant learning; building right on fairness and truth; building common schools on universities, and technical schools on common schools; creating a system that works well, not one that fails.

When night comes to the City of a Hundred Hills, a wind from the sea blows gently westward.
