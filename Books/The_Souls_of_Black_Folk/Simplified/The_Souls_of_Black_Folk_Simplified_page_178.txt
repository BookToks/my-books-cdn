Because of her, I came to love the little baby as he grew stronger. I watched his tiny soul open up in his baby sounds and half-words, and saw his eyes catch the sparkle of life. He was so beautiful, with his olive skin and dark golden curls, his eyes a mix of blue and brown, his perfect little body, and the soft roundness shaped by his African blood.  

I held him in my arms after we moved far away to our home in the South. I looked at the hot red soil of Georgia and the busy city full of hills and felt uneasy. Why was his hair golden? Golden hair was a bad sign in my life. Why hadn’t the brown in his eyes taken over and covered the blue? His father and grandfather both had brown eyes. In the Land of the Color-line, I saw the shadow of the Veil falling over my baby.  

I told myself he was born inside the Veil, and there he would live—as a Black boy, son of a Black man. In that little head was the proud spirit of a hunted people. With his tiny hand, he held onto a hope that wasn’t hopeless but not really hopeful either. His bright eyes looked deep into my soul, seeing a land where freedom was just a joke and liberty was a lie. I saw the shadow of the Veil pass over my baby and the cold city rising above the red earth. I held my face close to his cheek, showed him the stars and lights starting to shine, and tried to calm the silent fear I felt inside.  

He grew strong and full of life, filled with the quiet wisdom of someone who was only a little way from the beginning of all life. My wife and I almost worshipped this gift from God. Her life was built around the child; he touched every dream she had and made her try harder. No one but her could touch his little arms, no dress could touch him unless she had made it, and only her voice could comfort him to sleep. She and he spoke a soft, secret language, sharing their own special bond. I also thought about him as he lay in his little white bed. I saw my own strength reaching into the future through him, saw the hopes of my black ancestors moving forward in the crazy world, and heard in his baby voice the voice of the Prophet who would rise inside the Veil.
