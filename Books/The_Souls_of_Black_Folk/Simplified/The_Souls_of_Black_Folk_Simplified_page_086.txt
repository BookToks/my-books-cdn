At first, I felt a little nervous about going to bed in the one small bedroom, but everyone avoided any awkwardness. First, all the kids nodded off and slept, piled up on a big bunch of goose feathers. Then, the mom and dad quietly slipped away to the kitchen while I went to bed. After blowing out the dim light, they went to sleep in the dark.

In the morning, everyone was up and gone before I even thought about waking up.

Across the street, where fat Reuben lived, they all went outside while the teacher left, because they didn’t have a kitchen.

I liked staying with the Dowells because they had four rooms and lots of good country food. Uncle Bird had a small, rough farm with woods and hills, far from the main road. He told stories, sometimes preached, and with his kids, berries, horses, and wheat, he was happy and doing well. Sometimes, to keep peace, I had to go somewhere less nice. For example, ’Tildy’s mom was always dirty, Reuben’s food was very limited, and bugs ran wild over the Eddingses’ beds. My favorite place was Josie’s, where I sat on the porch eating peaches while her mom talked. She told me how Josie bought a sewing machine, worked in service jobs during winter, but made only four dollars a month, which was “mighty little” money. Josie wanted to go to school, but it seemed like they could never afford it. They talked about how crops failed, the well wasn’t finished, and how some white people were really “mean.”

I lived in this little world for two summers; it was boring and ordinary. The girls stared at the hill, wishing for more, and the boys were restless and hung around Alexandria. Alexandria was “town” — a spread-out, slow village with houses, churches, shops, and important people called Toms, Dicks, and Captains. On the hill to the north was the village of the black folks, who lived in small, unpainted houses. Some were tidy and homey, others were dirty. The houses were scattered, but all gathered around two churches: the Methodist and the Hard-Shell Baptist. These churches stood near a sad-looking schoolhouse. Every Sunday, my little world made its way there to meet others, gossip, wonder, and take part in the old-time religious service.
