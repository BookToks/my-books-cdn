So we dreamed, loved, and made plans through the fall and winter, and through the long Southern spring. Then the hot winds came from the smelly Gulf, making the roses shake and the strong sun shine harshly over the hills of Atlanta.

One night, little feet quietly walked to the small white bed, tiny hands shook, and a warm, flushed face tossed on the pillow. We knew the baby was sick. He stayed there for ten days—a quick week and three long days—getting weaker and weaker. At first, the mother cared for him happily and laughed when his little eyes smiled again. But then she stayed close and worried as the smile disappeared and fear sat by the bed.

The day didn’t end, and the night was a scary, dreamless time. Joy and sleep were gone. I still hear that voice at midnight calling me out of a dull, dreamless sleep, shouting, “The Shadow of Death! The Shadow of Death!” I crept outside into the starlight to wake the gray doctor—the Shadow of Death. The hours shook; the night listened; the terrible dawn slowly came across the lamplight. Then just the two of us looked at the child as he turned to us with big eyes and stretched his thin hands—the Shadow of Death! We said nothing and walked away.

He died at evening, when the sun was like a heavy sadness over the western hills, hiding its face; when the winds were quiet, and the big green trees he loved stood still. I saw his breath get faster and faster, stop, and then his little soul jumped like a star flying through the night, leaving darkness behind. The day stayed the same; the tall trees looked in through the windows, the green grass shone in the setting sun. But in the room of death was the saddest thing in the world—a mother without her child.

I don’t avoid pain. I want to work. I want a life full of struggle. I’m not a coward, afraid of the storm or even the scary shadow of death. But listen, Death! Isn’t my life hard enough? Isn’t this dull, cold place enough? Isn’t the world outside these four walls cruel enough? Why must you come here too, Death?
