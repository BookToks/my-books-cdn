Guiding our thoughts and carefully planning our actions is the way to be honorable and humane.

So, when we try to connect three big and sometimes conflicting ideas, everyone agrees on one solution: Education. This means training people in a way that uses everyone's work fairly without treating anyone badly. Education should help us keep the good parts of society and get rid of the unfair parts that hurt people and ignore their suffering.

But when we say that Education will fix all problems, that’s just an obvious statement. Learning teaches us how to live, but what kind of learning helps black and white people live well together? A hundred and fifty years ago, this seemed easier. Back then, Dr. Johnson said education was only for making life nicer and not for common people. Today, we want to open knowledge to many people and let only some understand its deepest truths, not just because of their family or money, but because of their skills and character.

However, it’s very hard to do this in the South, where slavery caused the most damage and where two groups of people are still behind in education. Creating a balance between ideal goals and practical needs here has been very difficult and full of trial and error.

We can roughly divide Southern education after the Civil War into four decades. From the end of the war until 1876, there was confusion and temporary help. Army schools, mission schools, and Freedman’s Bureau schools were all trying to work together but in a messy way. Then came ten years of real effort to build proper school systems in the South.

Normal schools and colleges were started for freed slaves, and teachers were trained there to work in public schools.
