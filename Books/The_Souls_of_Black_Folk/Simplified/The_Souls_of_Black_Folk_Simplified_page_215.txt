Listen to me, God who reads all, please donâ€™t let this book be ignored and forgotten. Let it grow strong ideas and inspire thoughtful actions that bring amazing results.

Let the people who have done wrong feel the truth, and let millions wish for fairness that lifts up whole nations, especially now when friendship between people seems fake and tricky.

In your perfect time, may clear thinking fix the confusion, and may these simple marks on fragile paper not be the end.
