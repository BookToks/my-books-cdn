The main idea is right in front of you; but when you try to explain it over time, it can seem strange and unclear. Still, when you feel something strongly, you really want to share it. And here, the feeling was very strong.

The style of writing is mostly tropical—African. There’s no need to be sorry for that. The blood of my ancestors spoke through me and broke free from the English style I was taught and lived around. Whether the result is good or not depends on personal taste. Sometimes I like it a lot, and sometimes I don’t.

In the late 1800s, a movement started in Chicago to create a center for writing and publishing in the Midwest. The Brownes, a father and son team who worked as editors, were looking for young and unknown writers. I had just published my first two books: one about stopping the African Slave Trade to America in 1896, and another called My Philadelphia Negro in 1899. I had also written some essays that got published in magazines like the Atlantic Monthly and the Dial.

Around 1900, the editors from McClurg asked me if I had any material for a book. At that time, I had just started working at Atlanta University on a big project about the problems faced by Black people in the United States. I told the editors about this, but they wanted something smaller and easier for regular readers. So, I decided to put together some of my essays, both old and new.

They liked the idea and offered to publish the book. I was unsure because I thought I could do better with more time and work. But finally, I got brave and sent the manuscript. Fifty years ago, The Souls of Black Folk was published. It was well received and went through many editions over the next generation.
