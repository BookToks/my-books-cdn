Different schools grew at different speeds: Hampton is still a high school, Fisk University started college classes in 1871, and Spelman Seminary began around 1896. All these schools had the same goal—to keep the quality of basic education high by giving teachers and leaders the best training possible. Most importantly, they wanted to give Black people good examples of culture and strong life values. It wasn’t enough for teachers to just learn teaching methods; they also needed to be open-minded and well-educated to help spread knowledge to a group of people who didn’t just lack reading and writing skills, but also life experience.

So, education in the South started with higher-level schools, which later helped create regular schools and trade schools, while also working to grow into colleges and universities. This growth was bound to happen eventually. But many people wondered if this growth was rushed or done badly. Many white Southerners felt this way. A well-known Southern newspaper recently said that trying to give Black students a classical education wasn’t working well.

The paper said that even though some Black students could handle the difficult courses, most just memorized the lessons without really understanding them. They graduated without clear goals or good jobs waiting for them. The whole plan was called a waste of time, effort, and money. While many would say this opinion is too harsh, people still ask important questions: Are enough Black students ready for college? Are too many being pushed into it too soon? Does this education make young Black people unhappy with their lives? Do these graduates do well after school? These questions are natural and can’t be ignored. But people who doubt Black students’ abilities shouldn’t just assume the answers are no without careful thought and an open mind.
