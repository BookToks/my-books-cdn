A university isn’t just a place to learn how to make money, train teachers, or be part of fancy social clubs. Its main job is to connect real life with growing knowledge about life. This connection is what helps build civilization.

The South really needs a university like this today. It has strong, sometimes strict religion that often ignores some important rules but adds extra ones. Places like Atlanta show people working hard and saving money. But the South doesn’t have enough wide knowledge about the world and how people live and work, which is needed to solve the many problems it faces now. The South needs lots of knowledge and culture, not just a little like before the war, especially in the world of work. Without this, no fancy treasures can save it from trouble.

The new universities in the South are like wings that will help the region grow.

They will help people avoid being tricked by easy but empty rewards.

These universities won’t keep people away from important things like cotton and gold, because those are part of life. But they will help people rise above them and find truth, freedom, and human kindness, staying pure and strong.

The Old South made mistakes by ignoring education for most people and not supporting colleges enough. Its old universities got weaker because of slavery and have struggled to survive after the war, hurt by social problems and selfishness, and lacking educated leaders. If this is true for white Southerners, it’s even more true for the sons of freed slaves. They need strong ideals and real culture to keep their souls away from small, selfish goals.

We should build strong Southern universities—like William and Mary, Trinity, Georgia, Texas, Tulane, Vanderbilt—and also support Black universities like Fisk, Howard, and Atlanta. These schools have wide foundations and high ideals, and they don’t just focus on numbers but on real learning.
