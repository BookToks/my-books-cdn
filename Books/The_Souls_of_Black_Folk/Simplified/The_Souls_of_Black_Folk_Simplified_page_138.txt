If Sam looks like a good worker, he and the merchant go to a lawyer, and Sam signs a loan agreement using his mule and wagon as security. In return, he gets seeds and food for a week. When the cotton plants start growing, Sam gives another loan agreement using his crop as security. Every Saturday, or sometimes less often, Sam goes to the merchant for his food supplies. A family of five usually gets about thirty pounds of pork and a couple of bushels of cornmeal each month. They also get clothes and shoes. If Sam or his family is sick, the merchant gives orders to the doctor or drugstore. If the mule needs new shoes, the merchant orders that, too. If Sam works hard and the crops look good, the merchant often encourages him to buy more things, like sugar, extra clothes, or even a buggy. But Sam is rarely encouraged to save money. When cotton prices went up last fall, the smart merchants sold a thousand buggies in one season, mostly to black men.

The security for these loans—a crop and property mortgage—might seem weak at first. The merchants tell many stories about tenants being lazy or cheating by stealing cotton, running off with mules, or leaving without paying. But overall, the merchant is the richest person in the area. He controls the tenant with strict legal agreements, leaving the black tenant with little choice but to stay poor or turn to crime. The tenant gives up all rights to protect his home in the contract. He can't use his own crop because the law gives the landlord and merchant almost full control over it. While the crop is growing, the merchant watches it carefully. When it's ready to sell, he takes it, pays the landlord’s rent, subtracts the debt for supplies, and if there’s anything left, he gives it to the tenant for a Christmas treat.

This system leads to farming only cotton and keeps the tenant poor. Cotton is the main money crop in the Black Belt. It sells easily and usually has steady prices, and the black workers know how to grow it well. Landlords want their rent paid in cotton, and merchants only accept loans on cotton crops. So, black tenants can’t try planting other crops. Also, this system is set up to keep the tenant broke. Once, I saw a small wagon with just one mule on the River road.
