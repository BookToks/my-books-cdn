We are the people whose deep love for music has given America its only truly American songs, fairy tales, and a mix of sadness and humor in a world focused on making money. Because of this, it is our job to protect our physical strength, our minds, and our spiritual beliefs.

We must unite in serious groups to carefully plan the best future for Black Americans.

This is why the American Negro Academy exists. It wants to be the center and voice of the minds of Black Americans, representing the hopes and dreams of one of the world’s great peoples. If it succeeds, the Academy will be...
