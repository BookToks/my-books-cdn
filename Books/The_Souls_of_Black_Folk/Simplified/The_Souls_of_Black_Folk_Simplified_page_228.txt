Some black men were born to white fathers and often got a good education. Because of this, a group of educated mixed-race men appeared to fight for black people’s rights. One of them was Ira Aldridge, who was loved all over Europe. Another was David Walker, who spoke out loudly and said: “It seems like some countries think God is asleep or that He made Africans just to work in mines and on farms. But I ask everyone who believes in God—is He not fair to all people?

If God allows rulers to keep our families and us in ignorance and poverty just to serve them, is He really fair? I ask Christians who keep us and our children in the worst kind of ignorance and suffering—if God lets you do this without stopping you, is He really a God of justice? If you believe we are human and care for each other, doesn’t the suffering of our ancestors and us cry out to God against you for the cruelty and violence you continue to cause?” This strong voice scared Southern lawmakers in 1829 because it spoke out against slavery.

In 1831, the first Black convention was held in Philadelphia. People watched with surprise, but the convention bravely faced the problems of race and slavery. They shouted against unfair laws that hurt innocent Black people, saying these laws were as cruel and wrong as anything a savage would do. This free Black movement and the abolition movement (which wanted to end slavery) worked side by side until they became one strong group.

Not enough people know how much the most talented Black leaders helped the abolition movement. From the day a Black man in Philadelphia first supported Garrison’s “Liberator” newspaper, to when Black soldiers helped make the Emancipation Proclamation happen, Black leaders worked together with white people. Leaders like Purvis, Remond, Pennington, Highland Garnett, Sojourner Truth, Alexander Crummell, and especially Frederick Douglass were very important. The abolition movement wouldn’t have succeeded without them.
