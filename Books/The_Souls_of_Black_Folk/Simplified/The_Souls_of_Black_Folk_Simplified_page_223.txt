It must show what really matters.  

It should be fair in how it acts.  

It needs to be strong in leading.  

The group should show the best ideas, the most honest efforts, and the highest goals. There are smart and good people all over the country who don’t get noticed or heard enough. The Negro Academy should help these people connect and speak together.  

The Academy should be fair and honest. It should lift up Black people by telling the truth, not lies or false praise. It should remind Black people that they have to work hard for themselves. They can’t just wait for others to fix things. Instead of complaining, they should work harder and try their best, because that will help more than any law or rule.  

The American Negro Academy must also show a clear way forward. Today, Black people face many questions like: How should we feel about voting rules? What about separate schools? How should we handle unfair treatment on trains or in hotels? These questions don’t need exact answers for every place but need a general plan. The Academy is the right group to share that plan honestly.  

But all this will take time and careful planning. Right now, the most important work is practical and helps Black people today. One big job is collecting all the laws about Black people from the country and the states. It’s a huge task that only a group like this can do, and if we do it, we will prove we matter.  

In studying society, we face a scary truth. We must be brave and honest about it. The Negro Academy should warn everyone that if we don’t fix our bad habits, they will take over us. Some of us are falling into crime, and many men and women don’t live pure lives. This alarm needs to be heard in every Black home.
