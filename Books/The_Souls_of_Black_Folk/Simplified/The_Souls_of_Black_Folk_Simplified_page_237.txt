I won’t deny how important it is to teach Black people how to work hard and skillfully. Industrial schools play a big role in this. But it’s wrong to think that just teaching work skills is enough. We also need to train well-educated men and women to teach other teachers, including those in public schools.

Education isn’t just about schools. It also comes from family and the people around you—your home, friends, and community. A Black boy in the South lives in a Black world, with its own leaders, ideas, and values. Most of what he learns comes from this world. His teachers are the community leaders like doctors, pastors, parents, and other strong, influential people. These leaders pass on culture and knowledge they’ve gained. We can’t ignore training these leaders. If they aren’t well-educated, the community will still have leaders, but many will be unprepared and cause problems. We have to help create thoughtful, trained leaders, or face the problems of having a confused and uncontrolled group.

I strongly support teaching practical skills and trades to both Black and white boys. After the war, industrial training for Black boys has been one of the best improvements in education. But true education isn’t just about making someone a carpenter; it’s about making a carpenter into a whole person. There are two important parts to this: first, the community needs educated teachers and leaders to help show what life really means; second, the worker needs enough intelligence and skill to do a good job. The first part needs good Black colleges and well-educated men—not too many colleges, but a few really good ones, and enough college-trained leaders to inspire others. The second part needs good public schools that are well-run and easy to get to.
