Before and right after the war, when many of the best Black people worked as servants in the best white families, there were close bonds between the races. They lived in the same homes, shared family life, often went to the same church, and talked to each other.

But as Black people became more advanced and educated, new groups appeared: more ministers, teachers, doctors, shop owners, mechanics, and independent farmers. These people became the leaders and upper class among Black communities. However, these leaders and the best white people don’t really connect or share ideas much anymore. They go to different churches, live in separate neighborhoods, don’t mix at public events, travel separately, and read different newspapers and books.

Most libraries, lectures, concerts, and museums don’t let Black people in, or only allow them under unfair conditions. Newspapers report on Black communities from a distance and often get things wrong. In schools, meetings, and social efforts, the two races who should understand and help each other often feel like strangers. Many white people think all Black people are narrow-minded, and many Black people think educated white people are dangerous or rude.

In the South, where public opinion is very strong and people don’t accept criticism easily, this problem is especially hard to fix. Both white and Black people are stuck because of the color line. Many attempts to bring the races closer have failed because someone made the race issue a big problem, and unwritten rules stopped anyone trying to change things.

I don’t need to say much about social contact between the races. The close friendship and love that used to exist between some white masters and their Black servants has almost completely disappeared because of the stronger and stricter color line drawn in recent years.
