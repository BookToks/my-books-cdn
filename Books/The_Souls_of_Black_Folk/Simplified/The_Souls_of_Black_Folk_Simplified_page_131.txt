Maybe they came from dragons’ teeth. The Cotton Kingdom is still alive; the world still listens to its power. Even the markets that once ignored newcomers have slowly started to move across the seas and, bit by bit, have begun heading toward the Black Belt.

Some people say the center of the Cotton Kingdom has moved from the Black to the White Belt, claiming that Black people now grow only half the cotton crop. But they forget that the cotton crop has more than doubled since slavery ended. Even if those people are right, Black workers still play a huge role in a Cotton Kingdom bigger than the one the Confederacy once hoped for. So today, Black field workers are an important part of a huge global industry, and for that reason, and because of history, it’s worth learning about their lives.

We rarely look at how Black people live today in a real and honest way. It’s easier to think we already know everything. Or maybe we don’t want to change our minds because of new facts. But we actually know very little about these millions of people—their daily lives, hopes, simple joys and pains, real problems, and why some of them commit crimes. To learn this, we need to get close to the people, not just talk about millions of them as if they were all the same over time and in different places.

So today, let’s focus on the Black Belt in Georgia and try to understand the lives of the Black farm workers in one county there.

In 1890, this county had ten thousand Black people and two thousand white people. The land is rich, but the people are poor. The main problem in the Black Belt is debt—not business loans, but the fact that most people don’t earn enough money to pay their bills. This comes from the bad economy left behind by slavery, and it got worse after slaves were freed. In 1860, Dougherty County had six thousand slaves worth over two and a half million dollars; the farms were worth about three million. So the total property was worth five and a half million dollars, but this value mostly depended on the slave system and the demand for land that was once very rich but was starting to lose its fertility because of careless farming.
