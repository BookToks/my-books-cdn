Back in colonial times, Phillis Wheatley and Paul Cuffe worked hard to fight against unfair treatment. Benjamin Banneker, who made almanacs, expressed their feelings when he wrote to Thomas Jefferson. He said, “I am proud to be African and have dark skin. I’m very thankful to God that I am free and not a slave like many others. I have enjoyed the blessings of liberty that you have, which I hope you also see as a gift from God.”

He reminded Jefferson about the time when the British tried hard to make Americans slaves. He asked him to remember the dangers they faced and how it seemed like no help was coming. Even hope was hard to find, but they survived by what seemed like a miracle. He said Jefferson should be grateful for the peace and freedom they now have, seeing it as a special blessing from heaven.

Banneker also talked about how Jefferson clearly understood that slavery was wrong. Jefferson was so against it that he said something very important: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are given certain rights that can’t be taken away, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” 

After them came Dr. James Derham, who knew more about medicine than even the famous Dr. Rush, and Lemuel Haynes, who got an honorary degree from Middlebury College in 1804. These people, along with others, were part of a group of talented Black leaders during the Revolutionary period. They worked hard to stop skin color from deciding who was free and who was a slave. But their efforts were undone by Eli Whitney and the greed for money. Because of this, they were mostly forgotten.

Still, their spirit didn’t completely die. Later in the early part of the century, other great men appeared here and there.
