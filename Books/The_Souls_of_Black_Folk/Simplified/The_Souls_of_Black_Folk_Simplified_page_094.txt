Today, the struggle of Black people trying to find themselves is like a small wheel inside a bigger wheel in the white world. Behind the Veil, there are smaller but similar problems—about ideals, leaders and followers, poverty, order, and control—and all of these are linked to race. Not many people know about these problems, and even fewer pay attention to them. But they are there, waiting for students, artists, and visionaries to discover and understand.

The temptation to focus on money has already reached this smaller world, which now affects the larger world in good and bad ways. The old Black leaders, like preachers and teachers, are no longer leading as they did twenty years ago. Instead, farmers, gardeners, well-paid porters, artisans, and businesspeople—those with property and money—are taking their place. Along with this change in leadership comes a change in values. The South today mourns the slow loss of a certain kind of Black person—the loyal, polite servant from the past, honest and humble. This person is disappearing just like the old Southern gentleman, for similar reasons—the dream of freedom turning into the harsh reality of needing to earn money, and money becoming the most important thing.

In the Black community, preachers and teachers once stood for the people’s ideals—the fight for a fairer world, dreams of justice, and the mystery of knowledge. But now, there’s a risk that these beautiful and inspiring ideals will be replaced by a focus on money and greed. Here is the young Black Atalanta, getting ready for the race she must run. If she still looks to the hills and sky like before, we can hope for a noble race. But what if someone, clever or careless, offers her golden apples? What if Black people are tempted to forget the fight for justice and knowledge and start thinking that money is everything? What if the greed for money in America joins with the growing greed in the South and the new greed of millions of awakening Black people?
