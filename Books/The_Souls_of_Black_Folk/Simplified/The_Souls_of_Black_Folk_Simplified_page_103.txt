War made people forget how much the master hated and misunderstood the slave, and it seemed like everything would get better after the chaos. At the same time, between 1885 and 1895, the South started its industrial revolution. The land showed signs of a new future and new ideas. The education system, trying to improve, faced new challenges and had more work to do. 

Black colleges were started quickly but didn’t have enough resources, were spread out strangely, and were not all good. Normal and high schools were mostly teaching basic stuff, and common schools were only educating about one-third of the kids who should be there, and even then, not very well. Meanwhile, white people in the South, because they had to give up slavery, became even more stuck in their racial hate, turning it into strict laws and harsh customs. Poor white people were pushing forward, making it harder for freed Black people to get jobs and survive.

Amid all this, the biggest problem was how Black people would find work. Moving from slavery to freedom was hard, especially with so much hate, unfair laws, and tough competition.

In this decade, the idea of industrial schools became important and fully recognized after 1895. These schools were the answer to both education and job problems, and this solution was smart and timely. At first, many schools taught some hands-on skills, but now this training became important and connected directly to the South’s big industrial growth. It reminded Black people that before you can reach knowledge, you have to work hard.

But these are just gates to something bigger. Looking beyond the immediate problems of the Black community, we can ask if industrial schools are really the final answer for training Black people. We should also ask the old, important question: isn’t life about more than just food and clothes?
