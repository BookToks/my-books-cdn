Introduction xxiii vibrates through the remainder of the chapter, as Du Bois considers the politics of higher education in the post-Reconstruction era, it also reverberates at greater levels of remove in The Souls of Black Folk as a whole, particularly in the concluding ‘After-Thought’.
 
 There, Du Bois addresses us again, with the hope and gamble that we will take the book up, in our ‘good time’, and make it live on, using‘infinite reason’ to ‘turn the tangle straight’ (p. 178).
