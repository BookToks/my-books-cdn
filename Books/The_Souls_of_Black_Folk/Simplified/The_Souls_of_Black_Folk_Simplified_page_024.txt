The idea of xxiii is talked about a lot in the rest of the chapter. Du Bois thinks about how higher education was affected after the Reconstruction period. This idea also shows up in the whole book, especially at the end in the part called ‘After-Thought’.

In that part, Du Bois speaks to us again. He hopes that we will read the book when we are ready. He wants us to keep the book’s message alive by using smart thinking to make sense of the complicated ideas (p. 178).
