Why, if the soul can shake off its dust and fly naked through the open sky, wouldn’t it be a shame for it to stay trapped in this broken body?

From the shimmering waters where long ago the slave-ship first saw Jamestown’s tower, three ways of thinking have come down to us.

The first is from the bigger world around us and far away. It says that as people’s needs grow in different cultures, all humans—Black, yellow, and white—must work together to meet them. This creates a new kind of unity, bringing the world closer. People feel excited about this meeting of different nations and groups, shouting, “If meeting like this just brings death, then such life is shameful.” Of course, this idea also hides the plan to control others, making brown-skinned people work for beads and cheap cloth.

The second idea comes from the older South. It’s the strong, honest belief that between humans and animals, God made something different called a Negro—a silly, simple creature, sometimes even lovable but always meant to live behind a thick, invisible curtain. Behind this belief is the fear that some might become equal to others, so walls and veils are built to keep them from even dreaming of breaking free.
