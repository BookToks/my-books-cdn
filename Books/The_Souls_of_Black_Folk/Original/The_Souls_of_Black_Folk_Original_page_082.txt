Deine Geister sende aus!
 
 Die Unsterblichen, die Reinen, Die nicht fühlen, die nicht weinen!
 
 Nicht die zarte Jungfrau wähle, Nicht der Hirtin weiche Seele!
 
 Schiller.* Once upon a time I taught school in the hills of Tennessee, where the broad dark vale of the Mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet the Alleghanies. I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought that Tennessee––beyond the Veil––was theirs alone, and in vacation time they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county school-commissioners. Young and happy, I too went, and I shall not soon forget that summer, seventeen years ago.
 
 First, there was a Teachers’ Institute at the county-seat; and there distinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers fractions and spelling and other mysteries,––white teachers in the morning, Negroes at night. A picnic now and then, and a supper, and the rough world was softened by laughter and song. I remember how––But I wander.
 
 There came a day when all the teachers left the Institute and began the hunt for schools. I learn from hearsay (for my mother was mortally afraid of fire-arms) that the hunting of ducks and bears and 46 The Souls of Black Folk men is wonderfully interesting, but I am sure that the man who has never hunted a country school has something to learn of the pleasures of the chase.
