Note on the Text xxv In the introduction to the Blue Heron edition, ‘Fifty Years Later’ (reprinted here in Appendix III), Du Bois explained that he had made ‘less than a half-dozen alterations in word or phrase’ in the 1953 version of the text. The historian Herbert Aptheker, when preparing an edition of the book in 1973 for Kraus-Thomson, noted seven alterations. The literary scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., with the assistance of the Black Periodical Literature project, made a lineby-line comparison of the 1903 and 1953 editions, and found two additional changes, which were first noted in the 1989 Bantam edition.

 (1953)peasants xxvi Note on the Text On 27 February 1953, Du Bois wrote a letter to Aptheker which the latter quoted in his ‘Introduction’ to the 1973 Kraus-Thomson edition to indicate a possible motivation for these revisions, in particular with regard to the term ‘Jews’: In Los Angeles, a friend gave me a copy of ‘Souls of Black Folk.
