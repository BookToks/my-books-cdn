who hath forgotten?
 
 Thou hast forgotten, O summer swallow, But the world shall end when I forget.
 
 Swinburne.* “Unto you a child is born,”* sang the bit of yellow paper that fluttered into my room one brown October morning. Then the fear of fatherhood mingled wildly with the joy of creation; I wondered how it looked and how it felt,––what were its eyes, and how its hair curled and crumpled itself. And I thought in awe of her,––she who had slept with Death to tear a man-child from underneath her heart,* while I was unconsciously wondering. I fled to my wife and child, repeating the while to myself half wonderingly, “Wife and child?
 
 Wife and child?”––fled fast and faster than boat and steam-car, and yet must ever impatiently await them; away from the hard-voiced city, away from the flickering sea into my own Berkshire Hills that sit all sadly guarding the gates of Massachusetts.
 
 Up the stairs I ran to the wan mother and whimpering babe, to the sanctuary on whose altar a life at my bidding had offered itself to win a life, and won. What is this tiny formless thing, this new-born wail from an unknown world,––all head and voice? I handle it curiously, and watch perplexed its winking, breathing, and sneezing. I did not love it then; it seemed a ludicrous thing to love; but her I loved, my Of the Passing of the First-Born 141 girl-mother, she whom now I saw unfolding like the glory of the morning––the transfigured woman.
