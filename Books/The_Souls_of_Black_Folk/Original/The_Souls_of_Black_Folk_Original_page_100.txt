vi Of the Training of Black Men Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside, And naked on the Air of Heaven ride, Were’t not a Shame––were’t not a Shame for him In this clay carcase crippled to abide?
 
 Omar Khayyám (Fitzgerald).* From the shimmering swirl of waters where many, many thoughts ago the slave-ship first saw the square tower of Jamestown, have flowed down to our day three streams of thinking: one swollen from the larger world here and overseas, saying, the multiplying of human wants in culture-lands calls for the world-wide coöperation of men in satisfying them. Hence arises a new human unity, pulling the ends of earth nearer, and all men, black, yellow, and white. The larger humanity strives to feel in this contact of living Nations and sleeping hordes a thrill of new life in the world, crying, “If the contact of Life and Sleep be Death, shame on such Life.” To be sure, behind this thought lurks the afterthought of force and dominion,––the making of brown men to delve when the temptation of beads and red calico cloys.
 
 The second thought streaming from the death-ship and the curving river is the thought of the older South,––the sincere and passionate belief that somewhere between men and cattle, God created a tertium quid,* and called it a Negro,––a clownish, simple creature, at times even lovable within its limitations, but straitly foreordained to walk within the Veil. To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought,––some of them with favoring chance might 64 The Souls of Black Folk become men, but in sheer self-defence we dare not let them, and we build about them walls so high, and hang between them and the light a veil so thick, that they shall not even think of breaking through.
