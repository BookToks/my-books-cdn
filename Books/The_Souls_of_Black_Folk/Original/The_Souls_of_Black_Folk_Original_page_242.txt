Work alone will not do it unless inspired by the right ideals and guided by intelligence. Education must not simply teach work––it must teach Life. The Talented Tenth of the Negro race must be made leaders of thought and missionaries of culture among their people. No others can do this work and Negro colleges must train men for it. The Negro race, like all other races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men.
