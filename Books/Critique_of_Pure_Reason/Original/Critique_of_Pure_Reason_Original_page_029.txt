The "Antinomies." The longest and most painstaking part of the "Transcendental Dialectic" is the "Antinomy of Pure Reason," which deals with the topics of rational cosmology (A40S-S83/B432-6II); in­ deed, as we will show below, Kant originally thought that all of the er­ rors of metaphysics could be diagnosed in the form of these antinomies.
 
 Here Kant argues that reason's natural illusions are not merely revealed by subtle philosophical analysis but unavoidably manifest themselves in the form of actual contradictions each side of which seems naturally plausible. Kant argues that unless we accept the transcendental idealist distinction between appearances and things in themselves, we will be committed to accepting mutually incompatible arguments, arguments both that there must be a first beginning of the world in time and that there cannot be, that there must be limits to the world in space and that there cannot be (the two halves of the first antinomy), both that there must be a simple substance and that there cannot be (the second antin­ omy), both that there must be at least one first or uncaused cause and that there cannot be (the third antinomy), and that there must be a being whose necessary existence is the ground of all contingent beings and that there can be no necessary being (the fourth antinomy).
 
 The only way of resolving these contradictions, Kant argues, is by ac­ cepting that the natural world is a realm of appearances constituted by the application of the categories to sensible intuitions, and not a realm of things in themselves. Regarding the first two antinomies, which he calls "mathematical" antinomies because they have to do with size and duration, Kant argues that there is no fact of the matter about the size of the world as a whole, because the natural world is never present in experience as a whole, but rather is given to us only through the pro­ gressive or regressive synthesis of spatiotemporal intuitions. We can al­ ways proceed indefinitely far in the progressive composition of spaces and times into ever larger or longer realms or in the regressive decom­ position of space and time into ever smaller regions, but we can never reach a beginning or an end to such series, as would be possible if they were finite, nor complete any synthesis of them as infinite either. Both sides of the mathematical antinomies, therefore, turn out to be false, be­ cause both rest on the common -and false -assumption that the world is given independently of our ongoing synthesis in its representation, 16 ) I ,I Introduction and that it therefore has a determinate magnitude, which must be either finite or infinite.
