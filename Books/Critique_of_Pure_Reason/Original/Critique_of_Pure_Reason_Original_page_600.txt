Critique of all speculative theology are allowed to make good this lack of complete determination by means of a mere idea of the highest perfection and original necessity, then we could be permitted this only by special favor, but it cannot be demanded by the right of an irresistible proof. Thus the physico-theological proof could perhaps lend support to other proofs (if there were any), by con足 necting speculation with intuition; but by itselfa it is more a preparation of the understanding for theological cognition, providing it with a straight and natural direction toward such cognition; it cannot com足 plete the business alone.' '4 Thus from this one can very well see that transcendental questions admit only of transcendental answers, i.e., answers from pureb priori a concepts, without the least empirical admixture. But here the question is obviously synthetic and demands an extension of our cognition be足 yond all the boundaries of experience, namely to the existence of a being that is supposed to correspond to our mere idea, to which no ex- A638/B666 perience can ever be equal. Now, according to the proofs we have given above, all synthetic cognition priori is possible only by the fact that it a expresses the formal conditions of a possible experience, and all principles are therefore only of immanent validity, i.e., they are related solely to objects of empirical cognition, or appearances. Thus through transcendental procedures aiming at a theology of mere speculative reason nothing is accomplished.
 
 But if one would rather call all the above proofs of the Analytic into doubt than be robbed of the persuasion that these grounds of proof that have been used for so long are of great weight, even then one cannot refuse to satisfy me when I demand that one should at least explain how, and by means of what illumination, one is justified in confidently soar足 ing above all possible experience through the power of mere ideas. New proofs, or improved reworkings of old ones, I would beg to be spared.
 
 For there is not much to choose here, since all merely speculative proofs finally amount to one single proof, namely the ontological, and I need not fear being overburdened by the fertility of the dogmatic champion of reason freed from sense; though without thinking myself very combative I will not refuse the challenge of discovering the fallacy A639/B667 in every such attempt of this kind, and so frustrate its pretensions; yet in this way the hope for better luck on the part of those who have become accustomed to dogmatic persuasion will never be fully done away with, and so I confine myself to one single fair demand: that one should provide a general justification, based on the nature of human understanding, together with all remaining sources of cognition, for making a start at extending one's cognition entirely priori and stretching it a for sich selbst a tauter b 587 r Doctrine of Elements.
