Kant's first critique of this ar­ gument is to be found in The Only Possible Ground ofProof(2:157-9).

 106 "But in that earnest place I Him who holds nothing back I Eternity holds fast in its strong arms." Viktor Albrecht von Haller (17°8-1777), Swiss physiologist and poet. "Unvollkommenes Gedicht tiber Ewigkeit" (Imperfect Poem on Eternity) (1736), Hailers Gedichte, ed. Ludwig Hirzel (Bibliothek iilterer Schriftwerke der deutschen Schweitz, 1882), 3:15I.
 
 The above lines from the poem are quoted by Kant in "The End of All Things" (1794), 8:327; cf. also 2:15I.
 
 107 There are fewer reflections on the criticism of the argument from design than on the others; see R 563 I (I778-80s, 18:262-3). However, the Cri­ tique ofJudf!l1lent's discussion of moral theology is based on an antecedent critique of physico-theology; see especially § 84 (5:436-42).
 
 108 In The Only Possible Ground of Proof, Kant refuses to regard physico­ theology as any sort of demonstration of God's existence (2:159-62). He rather considers physico-theology as a way of considering nature, and subjects "the usual method of physico-theology" to extensive criticism (2: II6-2 3), suggesting another method, better suited to the needs of nat­ ural science, in its place (2:123-37).
 
 109 Compare Leibniz, Monadology §§ 66-9. In The Only Possible Ground of Proof, Kant was also impressed by the microscopic researches of John Hill (c. 1716-1775), which had discovered "numerous animal species in a single drop of water, predatory kinds equipped with instruments of de­ struction, .. .; when I contemplate the intrigues, the violence, the scenes of commotion in a single part of matter, and when I direct my gaze up­ wards to the immeasurable spaces of the heavens teeming with worlds as with specks of dust, . . . no human language can express the feelings aroused by such a thought" (2: I 1 7 note). Hill's chief work was A General Natural History (1748-52), but the research Kant would have known was published in the Hamburger Magazin between 1753 and 1758.
 
 IIO Compare the presentation of the argument from design by Hume's Cleanthes: "Look round the world, contemplate the whole and every part of it: you will find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace or explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all the men who have ever contemplated them." (Hume, Dialog;ues con­ cerning Natural Religion, ed. A. W Colver and V V Price, part II [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976), pp. 16r) Kant became acquainted with the German translation of Hume's Dialogues about the time of the composition of the Critique of Pure Reason, 748 Notes to pages 580-604 but it is not clear whether he was acquainted with it by the time he wrote this section.
