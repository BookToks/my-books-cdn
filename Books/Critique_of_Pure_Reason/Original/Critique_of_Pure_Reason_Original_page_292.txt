On the highest principle of all analytic judgments lated to the categories. The principlesfl of the transcendental aesthetic, therefore, according to which space and time are the conditions of the possibility of all things as appearances, as well as the restriction of these principles, namely that they cannot be related to things in themselves, do not belong within our confined field of investigation. Likewise the mathematical principles do not constitute any part of this system, since they are drawn only from intuition, not from the pure concept of the understanding; yet their possibility, since they are likewise synthetic a B 189 priori judgments, necessarily finds a place here, not in order to prove their correctness and apodictic certainty, which is not at all necessary, but only to make comprehensible and to deduce the possibility of such evident cognitions a priori.
 
 But we must also speak of the principle of analytic judgments, in contrast, to be sure, to that of synthetic judgments, with which we are prop- AI5 0 erly concerned, since precisely this contrast will free the theory of the latter from all misunderstanding and lay their particular nature clearly before our eyes.
 
 The System of the Principles of Pure Understanding First Section On the supreme principle of all analytic judgments.55 Whatever the content of our cognition may be, and however it may be related to the object,b the general though to be sure only negative conÂ­ dition of all of our judgments whatsoever is that they do not contradict themselves; otherwise these judgments in themselves (even without regard to the objecty are nothing. But even if there is no contradiction B 190 within our judgment, it can nevertheless combine concepts in a way not entailed by the object, or even without any ground being given to us either a priori or a posteriori that would justify such a judgment, and thus, for all that a judgment may be free of any internal contradiction, it can still be either false or groundless.
 
 Now the proposition that no predicate pertains to a thing that con- AI51 tradicts it is called the principled of contradiction, and is a general though merely negative criterion of all truth, but on that account it also belongs merely to logic, since it holds of cognitions merely as cogniPrincipien a Object b , Object Satz: ordinarily translated as "proposition," it will be translated as "principle" in the d phrase "Satz des Widerspruchs" throughout this section.
