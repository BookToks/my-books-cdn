Once again, Kant was worrying about the dif­ ference between logical and real relations, but in this brief essay he did not yet have his own theory of how we could know something like ab­ solute space, or draw any general philosophical conclusions from this specific issue about the nature of space.
 
 The Inaugural Dissertation (1770). This was to change in Kant's next work, also the last of his publications on the way to the Critique be­ fore the "silent decade" of the I 77os. This was Kant's inaugural disser­ tation, De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis Forma et Principiis (On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World), defended and published in August 1770, after Kant's long-awaited ascension to the chair of logic and metaphysics in Konigsberg on March 3 I of that year. The work is presumed to have been written between March and August, although Kant had begun to mention the possibility of writing a systematic work on new foundations for metaphysics as early as 1765, and his publisher had even listed a forthcoming book on The Proper Method of Metaphysics in the autumn book fair catalogue of that year.58 But whatever plan he may have had at that time had come to naught, and it was not until occasion demanded it in 1770 that Kant wrote an­ other systematic work, though as it turned out an essay on the substance rather than the method of metaphysics.
 
 This work is a milestone in Kant's progress toward the Critique of Pure Reason because it introduces the fundamental distinction between the sensible and the intellectual capacities of the mind, the capacity, on the one hand, to have singular and immediate representations of par­ ticular objects by means of the senses, which Kant henceforth calls "in­ tuition";59 and, on the other hand, the capacity to form abstract and general representations, or concepts, by means of the intellect. Further, as his title suggests, Kant argues that our capacities for intuition and conceptualization each have their own characteristic forms, principles, or laws, which can be known by us and which constitute the basis of metaphysical cognition. Moreover, Kant argues, introducing the doc­ trine that he will later name "transcendental idealism," the "laws of in­ tuitive cognition, "60 or the laws of the representation of things by means of the senses, characterize how things necessarily appear to us, but not how they actually are in themselves.61 By contrast, at this stage, al­ though not later, Kant holds that intellectual representations of things, or concepts, present things "as they are." Thus, sensibility and intellect present us with two different accounts of objects: "phenomena," things as they appear to the senses, and "noumena," things as they really are and are known to be by the intellect (nous).62 On this account, sensibility and the intellect operate essentially inde­ pendently of one another. The fundamental stimulus to this radical dis36 Introduction tinction seems to have been Kant's discovery, perhaps made in 1769, that several paradoxes about the infinite (long known and prominently discussed by a number of eighteenth-century philosophers),63 such as the conflict between the supposition that time appears to have no be­ ginning yet any object and thus any universe of objects must have had a beginning, could be resolved by distinguishing between the forms of intuition as forms of appearance, on the one hand, and the forms of thought as the forms of reality, on the other: thus it could be argued, for example, that there is no contradiction between the sensible appearance that time has no beginning and the reality, known by the intellect, that all existence must have some beginning, for sensibility and intellect do not present the same things.
