More immediate precursors of the present section can be found at R 505I (1776-78, 18:73); R 5552 (1778-81, 18:218-21), clearly a draft for the present section, which lists the specific pairs of concepts discussed below at A263-6/ B 3 19-22 as well as the classification of concepts of something and nothing (A290-2/ B346-9); and R 5554 (1778-81, 18:229-30).

 99 Leibniz illustrated his principle of the identity of indiscernibles, the prin­ ciple that two things could never differ solely in spatiotemporal location without also having internal differences, which Kant is here attacking, with the example of two drops of water or milk, in his Fourth Letter to Samuel Clarke, § 4, first published in the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence in 17 I 7, the year after Leibniz's death.
 
 100 For us, evidence for the ascription of such a view to Leibniz would be an essay like "Primary Truths," in which Leibniz infers the identity of indis­ cernibles from the analytical nature of all proof of truth, an inference which depends upon the assumption that the analysis of concepts is the source of all truth (in G. W Leibniz, Philosophical Essays, ed. Roger Ariew and Daniel Garber [Indianapolis : Hackett, 1989], pp. 31-2). But since Kant could not have been familiar with this essay, not published until 1905, he must have based his characterization of Leibniz's reasoning on other sources, such as the derivation of the identity of indiscernibles from the claim that all differences in nature are founded on "intrinsic denom­ inations" at Monadology, § 9. Leibniz's discussion of the principle in his Fifth Paper in the Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, §§ 21-5, does not make its origins as opposed to its implications particularly clear, although the following §§ 26-9 do suggest that the principle is connected with Leibniz's denial of the fundamentality of spatial and temporal predicates, which by implication leaves only conceptual considerations as the basis of truth.
 
 101 The introduction of an arithmetical example in this context is another reference to the argument of Negative Magnitudes, where Kant uses the mathematical concept of subtraction rather than the logical notion of contradiction to provide a framework for understanding opposition in real entities such as forces, emotions, and so on. See 2:172-4; in Theoreti­ cal Philosophy, I75)-I770, pp. 2I2-14.
 
 102 Among sources available to Kant, see, e.g., A New System of Nature, in Ariew and Garber, p. 139; Principles of Nature and Grace, § 2; and Monad­ ology, §§ 3-1 I.

 104 Aristotle's Topics begins with the proposal "to find a line of inquiry whereby we shall be able to reason from reputable opinions about any subject presented to us, and also shall ourselves, when putting forward an argument, avoid saying anything contrary to it" (IOoa2o-3; translation by 733 Notes to pages 372-374 W.
