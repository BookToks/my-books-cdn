It cannot be experience, for the principle that has been adduced adds the latter representations to the former not only with greater generality than experience can provide, but also with the expression of necessity, hence entirely priori and from mere concepts.
 
 a '"1\10 Now the entire final aim of our speculative priori cognition rests on a such synthetic, i.e., ampliative, principles; for the analytic ones are, to be sure, most important and necessary, but only for attaining that dis­ tinctness of concepts that is requisite for a secure and extended synthe­ sis as a really new construction.a bA certain mystery thus lies hidden here,* the elucidation of which alone can make progress in the boundless field of pure cognition of the understanding secure and reliable: namely, to uncover the �round of the possibility of synthetic priori judgments with appropriate generality, to a gain insight into the conditions that make every kind of them possible, and not merely to designate this entire cognition (which comprises its own species) in a cursory outline, but to determine it completely and adequately for every use in a system in accordance with its primary sources, divisions, domain, and boundaries. So much provisionally for the pecularities of synthetic judgments.
 
 B 24 cNow from all of this there results the idea of a special science, which A I I could serve for the critique of pure reason. Every cognition is called pure, however, that is not mixed with anything foreign to it. But a cog­ nition is called absolutely pure, in particular, in which no experience or sensation at all is mixed in, and that is thus fully priori. Now reason is a the faculty that provides the principlesd of cognition priori. Hence a pure reason is that which contains the principlese for cognizing some­ thing absolutely priori. An organon of pure reason would be a sum a B 25 total oft hose principles! in accordance with which all pure priori coga * If it had occurred to one of the ancients even to raise this question, this alone would have offered powerful resistance to all the systems of pure reason down to our own times, and would have spared us so many vain attempts that were blindly undertaken without knowledge of what was really at issue.
