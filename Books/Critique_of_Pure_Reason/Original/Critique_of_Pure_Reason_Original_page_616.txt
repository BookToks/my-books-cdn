Critique of all speculative theology cognition of the object itself (as in the application of the categories to their sensible schemata), but only a rule or principlea of the systematic unity of all use of the understanding. Now since every principle that es­ tablishes for the understanding a thoroughgoing unity of its use priori a is also valid, albeit only indirectly, for the object of experience, the prin­ ciples of pure reason will also have objective reality in regard to this ob­ ject, yet not so as to detennine something in it, but only to indicate the procedure in accordance with which the empirical and determinate use of the understanding in experience can be brought into thoroughgoing A666/B694 agreement with itself, by bringing it as far as possible into connection with the principleb of thoroughJoing unity; and from that it is derived.
 
 I call all subjective principles that are taken not from the constitution of the objectC but from the interest of reason in regard to a certain pos­ sible perfection of the cognition of this object, d maxims of reason. lI8 Thus there are maxims of speculative reason, which rest solely on rea­ son's speculative interest, even though it may seem as if they were ob­ jective principles.
 
 e If merely regulative principles are considered as constitutive, then as objective principles! they can be in conflict; but if one considers them merely as maxims, then it is not a true conflict, but it is merely a dif­ ferent interest of reason that causes a divorce between ways of think­ ing.g Reason has in fact only a single unifiedh interest, and the conflict between its maxims is only a variation and a reciprocal limitation of the methods satisfying this interest.
 
 In this way the interest in manifoldness (in accordance with the principlei of specification) might hold more for this sophistical rea­ soner/ while unity (in accordance with the principlek of aggregation) holds more for that one. Each of them believes that his judgment comes from insight into the object,' and yet he grounds it solely on the A667/B695 greater or lesser attachment to one of the two principles, neither of which rests on any objective grounds, but only on the interest of reason, and that could better be called "maxims" than "principles."m If I see a Princip Princip b , Object Object d , Principien f Principien Trennung der Denkungsart g einiges h , Princip j Vernunftler Princip k Object I Principien m 603 Doctrine of Elements.
