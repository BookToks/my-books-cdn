Impossibility of a cosmological proof the unity of appearances, and has, insofar as it is empirically uncondi­ tioned, in itself the properties of a regulative principle.a Nevertheless, since each determination of matter that constitutes what is real in it, hence impenetrability too, is an effect (action) that must have its cause, and hence is always derivative, matter is not suited to the idea of a nec­ essary being as the principleb of all derivative unity, because each of its real properties as derivative is only conditionally necessary and hence can in itself be cancelled; but then the entire existence of matter would be cancelled; but if this did not happen, we would have reached the highest ground of unity empirically, which is forbidden by the second regulative principle;c thus it follows that matter, and in general every­ thing belonging to the world, is not suited to the idea of a necessary original being as a mere principled of the greatest empirical unity, but this must be posited outside the world, since then we can always be con­ fident of deriving the appearances of the world and their existence from others, as though there were no necessary being, and nevertheless we can strive ceaselessly toward completeness in this derivation, as though such a being were presupposed as a highest ground. A619/B647 The ideal of the highest being is, according to these considerations, nothing other than a regulative principle' of reason, to regard all combination in the world as if it arose from an all-sufficient necessary cause, so as to ground on that cause the rule of a unity that is system­ atic and necessary according to universal laws; but it is not an assertion of an existence that is necessary in itself. But at the same time it is un­ avoidable, by means of a transcendental subreption, to represent this formal principle! to oneself as constitutive, and to think of this unity hypostatically. For, just as with space, since it originally makes possible all forms which are merely limitations of it, even though it is only a principleg of sensibility, it is necessarily held to be a Something subsist­ ing in itself with absolute necessity and an a priori object given in itself, so it also comes about entirely naturally that since the systematic unity of nature cannot be set up as a principleh of the empirical use of reason except on the basis of the idea of a most real being as the supreme cause, this idea is thereby represented as an actual object, and this object again, because it is the supreme condition, is represented as necessary, so that a Princip Princip h , Princip Princip d Princip e f Princip Principium g Princip h 577 Doctrine of Elements.
