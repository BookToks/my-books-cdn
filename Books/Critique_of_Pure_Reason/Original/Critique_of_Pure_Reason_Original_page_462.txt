4° This acute philosopher soon noticed that the usual argument through which it is to be proved that the soul (if one grants that it is a simple being) cannot cease through disintegration, is insufficient for the aim of securing the soul's necessary continuing duration, since one could still assume cessation of its existence by vanishing. In his Phaedo, he sought to avoid this perishability, which would be a true annihilation, by attempting to prove that a simple being cannot cease to be at all because, since it cannot be diminished and thus lose more and more of its existence, and so be gradually transformed into nothing (since it has no B414 parts and thus no plurality in itself), there would be no time at all between a moment in which it is and another moment in which it is not, which is impossible. -Yet he did not consider that even if we allow the soul this simple nature, namely, that it contains no manifold [of parts] outside one another, and hence no extensive magnitude, one nevertheless cannot deny to it, any more than to any other existence, an intensive magnitude, i.e., a degree of reality in regard to all its faculties, indeed to everything in general that constitutes its existence, which might diminish through all the infinitely many smaller degrees; and thus the supposed substance (the thing whose persistence has not been otherwise established already) could be transformed into nothing, although not by disintegration, but by a gradual remission (remissio) of all its powers (hence, if I may be allowed to use this expression, through elanguescence). For even consciousness always has a degree, which can always be diminished;* consequently, so does the faculty of being conscious of oneself, and likewise with all other faculties. -Thus the per- B415 sistence of the soul, merely as an object of inner sense, remains unproved and even unprovable, although its persistence in life, where the thinking being (as a human being) is at the same time an object of * Clarity is not, as the logicians say, the consciousness of a representation;41 for B414 a certain degree of consciousness, which, however, is not sufficient for memory, must be met with even in some obscure representations, because without any consciousness we would make no distinction in the combination of obscure representations; yet we are capable of doing this with the marks of some B415 concepts (such as those of right and equity, or those of a musician who, when improvising, hits many notes at the same time). Rather a representation is clear if the consciousness in it is sufficient for a consciousness of the difference between it and others. To be sure, if this consciousness suffices for a dis­ tinction, but not for a consciousness of the difference, then the representation must still be called obscure. So there are infinitely many degrees of con­ sciousness down to its vanishing.
