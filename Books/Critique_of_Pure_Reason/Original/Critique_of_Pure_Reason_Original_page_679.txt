Ch. I. Sec. IV general consensus of experts, been in vain, and, since one still could not abandon this principle, until the transcendental critique came onto the scene one preferred obstinately to appeal to healthy human underA 784/ B 8I2 standing (a refuge, which always proves that the cause of reason is in de­ spair) rather than to attempt new dogmatic proofs.
 
 But if the proposition of which a proof is to be given is an assertion of pure reason, and if I would even go beyond my concepts of experi­ ence by means of mere ideas, then all the more must this proof contain the justification of such a step of synthesis (if it would otherwise be pos­ sible) as a necessary condition of its probative force. Hence as plausible as the supposed proof of the simple nature of our thinking substance from the unity of apperception may be, yet it is unavoidably faced with the difficulty that, since absolute simplicity is not a concept that can be immediately related to a perception, but rather as an idea must be merely inferred, there can be no insight at all into how the mere con­ sciousness that is contained or at least can be contained in all thinking should, even though it is to this extent a simple representation, lead to the consciousness and knowledge of a thing in which alone thinking can be contained.2 2 For if I represent to myself the force of my body in motion, it is to that extent absolute unity for me, and my representation of it is simple; hence I can also express it through the motion of a point, since its volume is not relevant, and without diminution of the force it can be represented as being as small as one wants and can even be conA 78S/B 8I3 ceived of as being located in one point. But I would not infer from this that if nothing is given to me except the moving force of a body then the body can be conceived of as a simple substance just because its rep­ resentation abstracts from all magnitude of the content of space and is therefore simple. Now I discover a paralogism in the fact that the sim­ ple in the abstract is entirely different from the simple in the objectb and that the I, which taken in the first sense comprises no manifold within itself, if taken in the second sense, in which it signifies the soul itself, can be a very complex concept, namely containing under itself and designating quite a lot. Only in order to have any presentiment of this paralogism (for without such a provisional conjecture one would hardly have any suspicion of the proot), it is always necessary to have at hand an enduring criterion of the possibility of such synthetic proposi­ tions, which prove more than experience can yield, which criterion con­ sists in the fact that the proof leads to the required predicate not directly but only by means of a principled of the possibility of expanda Kenntnis b Object , im ersteren Verstande d Princips 666 The discipline of pure reason in proofs ing our given concepts a priori to ideas and realizing these.
