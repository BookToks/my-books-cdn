On the Ground of the Distinction <A> sistence (which is existence at all times), then nothing is left in my con­ cept of substance except the logical representation of the subject, which I try to realize by representing to myself something that can occur solely as subject (without being a predicate of anything). But then it is A243 not only the case that I do not even know of any conditions under which B 301 this logical preeminence can be attributed to any sort of thing;O it is also the case that absolutely nothing further is to be made of it, and not even the least consequence is to be drawn from it, because by its means no objectb whatever of the use of this concept is determined, and one therefore does not even know whether the latter means anything at all.
 
 From the concept of a cause as a pure category (ifI leave out the time in which something follows something else in accordance with a rule), I will not find out anything more than that it is something that allows an inference to the existence of something else; and in that case not only would there be nothing through which cause and effect could be dis­ tinguished, but further, since the possibility of drawing this inference also requires conditions about which I would know nothing, the concept would not even have any determination through which to apply to any object.c The supposed principle "Everything contingent has a cause" steps forth rather gravely, as if it had its own dignity in itself. Yet if I ask what you mean by "contingent," and you answer, "that the notbeing of which is possible," then I would gladly know by what means you intend to cognize the possibility of this not-being, if you do not represent a succession in the series of appearances and in this succession an existence, which follows on the not-being (or conversely), and thus a change; for that the not-being of a thing does not contradict itself is A244 a lame appeal to a logical condition, which is certainly necessary for the B 302 concept but far from sufficient for real possibility; for I can suspend any existing substance in thought without contradicting myself, but I cannot at all infer from that to the objective contingency of its existence, i.e., the possibility of itsd not-being in itself. As far as the concept of community is concerned, it is easy to appreciate that since the pure categories of substance as well as causality do not admit of any definition determining the object,e reciprocal causality in the relation of substances to each other (commercium) will be just as little susceptible of it.
 
 No one has ever been able to define possibility, existence, and necessity except through obvious tautologies if he wanted to draw their definition solely from the pure understanding.
