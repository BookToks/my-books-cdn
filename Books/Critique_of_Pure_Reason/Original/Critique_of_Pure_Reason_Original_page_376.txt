If one abandons the senses, how will one make comprehensible that our categories (which would be the only re- A2S6 maining concepts for noumena)a still signify anything at all, since for their relation to any object something more than merely the unity of thinking must be given, namely a possible intuition, to which they can be applied? Nevertheless the concept of a noumenon,b taken merely problematically, remains not only admissible, but even unavoidable, as a concept setting limits to sensibility. But in that case it is not a special intelligible object for our understanding; rather an understanding to which it would belong is itself a problem, that, namely, of cognizing its object not discursively through categories but intuitively in a non- B3I2 sensible intuition, the possibility of which we cannot in the least represent. Now in this way our understanding acquires a negative expansion, i.e., it is not limited by sensibility, but rather limits it by calling things in themselves (not considered as appearances) noumena. But it also im­ mediately sets boundaries for itself, not cognizing these things through categories, hence merely thinking them under the name of an unknown something.
 
 Yet I find in the writings of the moderns an entirely different use of the expressions of a mundi sensibilis and intelligibilis, which entirely di*,c verges from the sense of the ancients, which is not itself a problem, but A2S7 which is also nothing but empty trafficking with words. In accordance with this usage some have been pleased to call the sum total of appearances, so far as it is intuited, the world of sense, but the connectiond of them insofar as it is thought in accordance with general laws of the un­ derstanding, the world of understanding. Theoretical astronomy, which B 3 I 3 expounds the mere observation of the starry heavens, would be the former, contemplative astronomy on the contrary (explained, say, according to the Copernican world-system or even according to Newton's laws of gravitation) would be the latter, making an intelligible world * <In place of this expression one must not use that of an intellectual world, as B 3 12 is customary in German; for only cognitions are intellectual or sensitive. But that which can only be an object of the one mode of intuition or the other, the objectse therefore, must be called intelligible or sensible (regardless of how harsh it sounds).> a Not in roman type.
