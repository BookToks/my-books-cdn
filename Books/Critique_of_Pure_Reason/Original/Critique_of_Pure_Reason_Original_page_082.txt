Thus, Kant argues that while mere "judgments of perception," which make no claim to necessary objective validity or the agreement of others at all, but only report how things seem to a single subject, use the logical forms of judgment, "judgments of experience," which do make claims to objective validity necessary for all, can only derive their universal and necessary validity from their use of a priori categories to make the oth­ erwise indeterminate use of the forms of judgment determinate. '75 This approach is pursued even further in the Preface to the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science three years later, where Kant suggests that the categories can be derived as the necessary conditions of making the use of the logical forms of judgment determinate even without explicit reference to the alleged distinction between judgments of perception and of experience. '76 But although this strategy avoids the obscurity of some of Kant's claims about the transcendental unity of apperception, it is open to the charge of begging the question against both empiricists and skeptics, proving that the categories are necessary only by accept­ ing an interpretation of ordinary and scientific knowledge-claims as universally and necessarily true that neither a skeptic nor an empiricist would dream of accepting.
 
 In any case, Kant's notes from the period 1783-84 show that he con­ tinued to experiment with both the unity of apperception as well as the concept of objectively valid judgment as possible bases for the deduc­ tion of the categories. '77 However, when Kant came to rewrite the chapter on the transcendental deduction for the second edition, he returned to his original strategy of trying to combine the conditions of possibility of the unity of apperception with those of the judgment of objects to create an unshakable foundation for the objective validity of the categories.
 
 When Kant was first notified by his publisher in April 1786 that a new edition of the Critique would be needed, he apparently contem­ plated a drastic revision that would include an extensive discussion of practical reason as well as a restatement of his work on theoretical rea­ son. At the same time, he also assumed the rectorship of his university.
 
 At some point during the year he must have decided on the more mod­ est though still extensive revisions that we have, enough of which were completed by January 1787 for typesetting of the new edition to begin, and all of which were apparently completed by that April, just a year after the new edition was first requested. '78 (At some point between 1781 and 1787 Kant made the annotations in his own copy of the first edition of the Critique that we reproduce throughout our translation, but as these notes are not closely matched by the changes in the edition 69 Introduction of I787, there is no reason to believe that these notes were made dur­ ing I786-87 as part of the work on the new edition.
