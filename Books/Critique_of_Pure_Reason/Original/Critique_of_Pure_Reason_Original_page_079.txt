",65 Ten days later, he wrote to Herz these lines: My work, may it stand or fall, cannot help but bring about a complete change of thinking in this part of human knowledge [metaphysics], a part of knowledge that concerns us so earnestly. For my part I have nowhere sought to create mi­ rages or to advance specious arguments in order to patch up my system; I have rather let years pass by, in order that I might get to a finished insight that would satisfy me completely and at which I have in fact arrived; so that I now find nothing I want to change in the main theory (something I could never say of any of my previous writings), though here and there little additions and clarifi­ cations would be desirable. ,66 V.
 
 THE CHANGES IN THE SECOND EDITION For Kant himself, the Critique of Pure Reason was never intended to be more than a propaedeutic to the systematic metaphysics of nature and of morals that he had long intended to write, and his own intention upon the completion of the Critique must have been to proceed directly to these two parts of his philosophical system. He made substantial progress in this direction, publishing the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science in 1786, in which he tried to show that the application of his general principles of judgment to the empirical concept of mo­ tion yields the basic principles of Newtonian physics, and the Ground­ work of the Metaphysics of Morals in 1785, intended to be the introduction to the detailed system of duties that would constitute the metaphysics of morals (and would not in fact appear until 1797)' But the initial re­ ception of the Critique of Pure Reason sorely disappointed Kant's expec­ tation that the work could not "help but bring about a complete change of thinking," and a great deal of Kant's effort during the decade of the I780s was devoted to the unforeseen task of clarifying the critical foun­ dations of his system of philosophy that he thought he had completed in May I781. This work took a number of different forms: the publica­ tion of a brief defense and attempted popularization of the Critique in 1783, the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics; continued work on the transcendental deduction in his private notes during 1783-84; a pro­ posed revision of the transcendental deduction of the categories in the introduction to the 1786 Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science; a substantial revision of the Critique of Pure Reason for its second edition in 1787; and finally the publication of two further critiques, the Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and the Critique of Judgment (1790), which were clearly not works Kant had planned at the time of the publication 66 Introduction of the Critique of Pure Reason but which instead grew out of his ongoing struggle to clarify the foundations of his critical philosophy.
