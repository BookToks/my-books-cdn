Before he could progress from the inaugural dissertation to the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant would have to develop a new conception of the use of the intellect with distinctions among the sensible use of the understanding, the illusory use of pure theoretical reason, and the reli­ able use of pure practical reason.

 THE GENESIS OF THE CRITIQUE 1770-72. After the publication of the dissertation, Kant fell into a pro­ longed silence broken only by a few minor essays97 and a series of let­ ters to his student Marcus Herz. Herz had participated in the public defense of Kant's dissertation98 and was now in Berlin, studying medi­ cine but also in contact with the prominent philosophers of the capital.
 
 Aside from what little can be gleaned from these letters, our primary source of information about Kant's thought in these years comes from surviving marginalia and notes, though presumably these are only a fragment of what Kant actually wrote during this period and have to be used with caution.99 Fragmentary as they are, however, these materials cast considerable light on the emergence of some of the most important new arguments of the Critique and also explain some of its most trou­ blesome obscurities.
 
 In the fall of 1770, Herz went off to Berlin with copies of the disser­ tation for leading intellectuals such as Mendelssohn, Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777) and Johann Georg Sulzer (1720-1779), and ac­ companying letters, of which only the letter to Lambert survives. In this letter Kant apologizes for the lapse of a prior promise of collaboration, makes a promise for the rapid publication of a work on the metaphysics of morals (a promise that would not even begin to be redeemed for an­ other fifteen years)100 and otherwise evinces his continuing commit­ ment to the view of metaphysics enunciated in the dissertation. lOr By Christmas, all three Berlin philosophers had replied with letters con­ taining essentially the same objection: how could Kant hold time to be a mere appearance with no objective reality when time is the form of inner sense and we all have immediate experience of changes in inner sense regardless of whatever external significance we might impute to those changing internal senses?102 Lambert initially raises a question about whether Kant's "two ways of knowing," from the senses and the intellect, "are so completely sepa­ rated that they never come together, " 103 but then discusses in detail only Kant's treatment of time, accepting Kant's arguments that time is sin46 Introduction gular, continuous, and the object of a pure intuition but objecting to Kant's idealism about time: All changes are bound to time and are inconceivable without time.
