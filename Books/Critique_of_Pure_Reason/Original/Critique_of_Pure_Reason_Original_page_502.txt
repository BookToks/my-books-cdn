The antithetic of pure reason Moreover, even if a transcendental faculty of freedom is conceded in order to begin alterations in the world, then this faculty would in any case have to be outside the world (although it always remains a bold presumption to assume an object outside the sum total of all possible in­ tuitions, which cannot be given in any possible perception). Yet it can never be permitted to ascribe such a faculty to substances in the world itself, because then the connection of appearances necessarily deter­ mining one another in accordance with universal laws, which one calls nature, and with it the mark of empirical truth, which distinguishes ex­ perience from dreaming, would largely disappear. For alongside such a lawless faculty of freedom, nature could hardly be thought any longer, because the laws of the latter would be ceaselessly modified by the for­ mer, and this would render the play of appearances, which in accor­ dance with mere nature would be regular and uniform, confused and disconnected.
