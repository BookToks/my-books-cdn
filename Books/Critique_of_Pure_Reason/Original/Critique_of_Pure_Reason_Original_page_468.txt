This powerful ground of proof, which can never be refuted, accompanied by an ever increasing cognition of the purposiveness in everything we see and by a vision of the immensity of creation, hence also by the consciousness of a certain boundlessness in the possible extension of our knowledge, a along with a drive commensurate to it, always still remains, even if we must equally give up insight into the necessary continuation of our existence from the merely theoretical cognition of our self.
 
 Conclusion of the solution of the psychological paralogism.
 
 The dialectical illusion in rational psychology rests on the confusion of an idea of reason (of a pure intelligence) with the concept, in every way indeterminate, of a thinking being in general. I think of my self, in be足 half of a possible experience, by abstracting from all actual experience, and from this conclude that I could become conscious of my existence even outside experience and of its empirical conditions. Consequently I B427 confuse the possible abstraction from my empirically determined existence with the supposed consciousness of a separate possible existence of my thinking Self, and believe that I cognize what is substantial in me as a transcendental subject, since I have in thought merely the unity of consciousness that grounds everything determinate as the mere form of cognition.
 
 The problem of explaining the community of the soul with the body does not properly belong to the psychology that is here at issue, because it intends to prove the personality of the soul even outside this commu足 nity (after death), and so it is transcendent in the proper sense, even though it concerns an objectb of experience, but only to the extent that it ceases to be an object of experience. Meanwhile in accord with our doctrineC a sufficient reply can also be given to this problem. The diffi足 culty presented by this problem consists, as is well known, in the pre足 sumed difference in kind between the object of inner sense (the soul) and a Kenntnisse Object b , Lehrbegriff 455 Doctrine of Elements.
