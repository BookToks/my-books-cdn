Since systematic unity is that which first makes ordinary cognition into science, i.e., makes a system out of a mere aggregate of it, architectonic is the doc­ trine of that which is scientific in our cognition in general, and there­ fore necessarily belongs to the doctrine of method.
 
 Under the government of reason our cognitions cannot at all consti­ tute a rhapsody but must constitute a system, in which alone they can support and advance its essential ends. I understand by a system, how­ ever, the unity of the manifold cognitions under one idea. This is the rational concept of the form of a whole, insofar as through this the do­ main of the manifold as well as the position of the parts with respect to each other is determined a priori. The scientific rational concept thus contains the end and the form of the whole that is congruent with it.
 
 The unity of the end, to which all parts are related and in the idea of which they are also related to each other, allows the absence of any part to be noticed in our knowledge of the rest, and there can be no contingent addition or undetermined magnitude of perfection that does not A833/B861 have its boundaries determined a priori. The whole is therefore articulated (articulatio) and not heaped together (coacervatio );a it can, to be sure, grow internally (per intus susceptionem)b but not externally (per appositionem),c like an animal body, whose growth does not add a limb but rather makes each limb stronger and fitter for its end without any alteration of proportion.
 
 For its execution the idea needs a schema, i.e., an essential mani­ foldness and order of the parts determined a priori from the principled of the end. A schema that is not outlined in accordance with an idea, a Literally, "heaped up." b from an internal cause , by juxtaposition d Princip 691 Doctrine of Method.
