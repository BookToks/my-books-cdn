On the empirical use of the regulative principle guishing it from the mathematical one: that since the latter really has to do only with the combination of parts into a whole, or with the disso­ lution of a whole into its parts, the conditions of this series always have to be seen as parts of it, hence as being of the same lpnd, and conse­ quently as appearances, whereas in the former regress, which has to do not with the possibility of an unconditioned whole or an unconditioned part of a given whole but with the derivation of a state from its cause or of the contingent existence of a substance itself from the necessary ex­ istence of one, the condition need not necessarily constitute one em­ pirical series along with the conditioned.
 
 Therefore there remains only one way out of the apparent antinomy lying before us: since, namely, both the conflicting propositions can be true at the same time in a different relation in such a way that all things in the world of sense are completely contingent, hence having always only an empirically conditioned existence, there nevertheless occurs a non-empirical condition of the entire series, i.e., an unconditionally necessary being. For this, as an intelligible condition, would not belong to the series as a member of it (not even as the supreme member) at all, and would not make any member of the series unconditionally neces- A 56 1/B 589 sary, but it would leave the entire world of sense to the empirically conditioned existence which runs through all its members. Hence this way of grounding an unconditioned existence would be distinguished from the empirically unconditioned causality (of freedom) in the previous article in that in the case of freedom, the thing itself as cause (substantia phaenomenon)a would nevertheless belong to the series of conditions, and only its causality would be thought as intelligible, but here the necessary being would have to be thought of as entirely outside the series of the world of sense (as an ens extramundanum)b and merely intelligible; this is the only way of preventing it from being subjected to the law of the contingency and dependence of all appearances.84 The regulative principlec of reason in regard to this problem of ours is therefore that everything in the world of sense has an empirically conditioned existence, and there cannot be an unconditioned necessity in it in regard to any of its properties, that there is no member of the series such that one does not always expect an empirical condition for it in a possible experience, and for which one must seek for such a condi­ tion as far as one can, and nothing justifies us in deriving any existence from a condition outside the empirical series, or indeed in taking any­ thing in the series itself to be absolutely independent and self-sufficient; nevertheless, this is not in any way to deny that the entire series could B 562 / B 590 4 phenomenal substance a being outside the world b , Princip 547 Doctrine of Elements.
