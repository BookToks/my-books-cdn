Critique of all speculative theology atic unity of the understanding's cognitions, which, however, is the touchstone of truth for its rules. Conversely, systematic unity (as mere idea) is only a projected unity, which one must regard not as given in itself, but only as a problem;a this unity, however, helps to find a principleb for the manifold and particular uses of the understanding, thereby guiding it even in those cases that are not given and making it coherently connected.c From this, however, one sees only that systematic unity or the unity A648/B676 of reason of the manifold of the understanding's cognition is a logical principle,d in order, where the understanding alone does not attain to rules, to help it through ideas, simultaneously creating unanimity among its various rules under one principle< (the systematic), and thereby interconnection, as far as this can be done. But whether the constitution of objects or the nature of the understanding that cognizes them as such are in themselves determined to systematic unity, and whether one could in a certain measure postulate this a priori without taking into account such an interest of reason, and therefore say that all possible cognitions of the understanding (including empirical ones) have the unity of reason, and stand under common principles! from which they could be derived despite their variety: that would be a transcendental principle of reason, which would make systematic unity not merely something subjectively and logically necessary, as method, but objectively necessary.
 
 We will illustrate this through one case in which reason is used.
 
 Among the different kinds of unity according to concepts of the underÂ­ standing belongs the causality of a substance, which is called "power."g At first glance the various appearances of one and the same substance show such diversity that one must assume almost as many powers as there are effects, as in the human mind there are sensation, conscious- A649/B677 ness, imagination, memory, wit, the power to distinguish, pleasure, desire, etc. Initially a logical maxim bids us to reduce this apparent variety as far as possible by discovering hidden identity through comparison, and seeing if imagination combined with consciousness may not be memory, wit, the power to distinguish, or perhaps even understanding and reason. The idea of a fundamental power though logic does not at all ascertain whether there is such a thing -is at least the problemh a Problem Princip b , zusammenhiingend Princip d , Princip f Principien Kraft g Problem h 593 Doctrine of Elements.
