On the empirical use of the regulative principle ever many natural grounds or sensible stimuli there may be that impel me to will, they cannot produce the ought but only a willing that is yet far from necessary but rather always conditioned, over against which the ought that reason pronounces sets a measure and goal, indeed, a prohibition and authorization.a Whether it is an object of mere sensi­ bility (the agreeable) or even of pure reason (the good), reason does not give in to those grounds which are empirically given, and it does not follow the order of things as they are presented in intuition, but with complete spontaneity it makes its own order according to ideas, to which it fits the empirical conditions and according to which it even de­ clares actions to be necessary that yet have not occurred and perhaps will not occur, nevertheless presupposing of all such actions that reason could have causality in relation to them; for without that, it would not expect its ideas to have effects in experience.
 
 Now let us stop at this point and assume it is at least possible that reason actually does have causality in regard to appearances: then even A549/B577 though it is reason, it must nevertheless exhibit an empirical character, because every cause presupposes a rule according to which certain appearances follow as effects, and every rule requires a uniformity in its effects, grounding the concept of a cause (as a faculty), which, insofar as it must come to light from mere appearances, we could call the empirical character, which is constant, while its effects appear in alterable shapes, according to the differences among the conditions that accompany and in part limit it.
 
 Thus every human being has an empirical character for his power of choice, which is nothing other than a certain causality of his reason, in­ sofar as in its effects in appearance this reason exhibits a rule, in accor­ dance with which one could deriveb the rational grounds and the actions themselves according to their kind and degree, and estimateC the sub­ jective principlesd of his power of choice. Because this empirical char­ acter itself must be drawn from appearances as effect, and from the rule which experience provides, all the actions of the human being in ap­ pearance are determined in accord with the order of nature by his em­ pirical character and the other cooperating causes; and if we could investigate all the appearances of his power of choice down to their basis, then there would be no human action that we could not predict A 5 sol B 578 with certainty, and recognize as necessary given its preceding conditions. Thus in regard to this empirical character there is no freedom, and according to this character we can consider the human being solely a Ansehen b abnehmen , beurtheilen Principien d 541 Doctrine of Elements.
