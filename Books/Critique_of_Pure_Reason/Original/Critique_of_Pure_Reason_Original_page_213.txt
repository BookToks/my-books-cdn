Pt. II. Transcendental Logic could not be given to us in any way. Since it should properly be only a canon for the assessment of empirical use, it is misused if one lets it count as the organon of a general and unrestricted use, and dares to synthetically judge, assert, and decide about objects in general with the pure understanding alone. The use of the pure understanding would in this case therefore be dialectical. The second part of the transcendental logic must therefore be a critique of this dialectical illusion, and is called transcendental dialectic, not as an art of dogmatically arousing such il­ lusion (an unfortunately highly prevalent art among the manifold works of metaphysical jugglery), but rather as a critique of the understanding and reason in regard to their hyperphysical use, in order to uncover the A 64 false illusion of their groundless pretensions and to reduce their claims to invention and amplification, putatively to be attained through tran­ scendental principles, to the mere assessment and evaluation of the pure understanding, guarding it against sophistical tricks.
