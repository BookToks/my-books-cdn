Grounds of the possibility of experience <A> ception therefore grounds all concepts a priori, just as the manifoldness of space and time grounds the intuitions of sensibility.
 
 Just this transcendental unity of apperception, however, makes out of A ra8 all possible appearances that can ever come together in one experience a connection of all of these representations in accordance with laws.25 For this unity of consciousness would be impossible if in the cognition of the manifold the mind could not become conscious of the identity of the function by means of which this manifold is synthetically combined into one cognition. Thus the original and necessary consciousness of the identity of oneself is at the same time a consciousness of an equally necessary unity of the synthesis of all appearances in accordance with concepts, i.e., in accordance with rules that not only make them necessarily reproducible, but also thereby determine an object for their intuition, i.e., the concept of something in which they are necessarily connected; for the mind could not possibly think of the identity of itself in the manifoldness of its representations, and indeed think this a priori, if it did not have before its eyes the identity of its action, which subjects all synthesis of apprehension (which is empirical) to a tran­ scendental unity, and first makes possible their connection in accordance with a priori rules. Further, we are now also able to determine our concepts of an object in general more correctly. All representations, as representations, have their object, and can themselves be objects of other representations in turn. Appearances are the only objects that can be given to us immediately, and that in them which is immediately re- A 109 lated to the object is called !ntuition. However, these appearances are not things in themselves, but themselves only representations, which in turn have their object, which therefore cannot be further intuited by us, and that may therefore be called the non-empirical, i.e., transcendental object X26 = The pure concept of this transcendental object (which in all of our cognitions is really always one and the same X) is that which in all of = our empirical concepts in general can provide relation to an object, i.e., objective reality. Now this concept cannot contain any determinate in­ tuition at all, and therefore concerns nothing but that unity which must be encountered in a manifold of cognition insofar as it stands in relation to an object. This relation, however, is nothing other than the necessary unity of consciousness, thus also of the synthesis of the man­ ifold through a common function of the mind for combining it in one representation. Now since this unity must be regarded as necessary a priori (since the cognition would otherwise be without an object), the relation to a transcendental object, i.e., the objective reality of our empirical cognition, rests on the transcendental law that all appearances, A I 10 insofar as objects are to be given to us through them, must stand under a priori rules of their synthetic unity, in accordance with which their re233 Doctrine of Elements.
