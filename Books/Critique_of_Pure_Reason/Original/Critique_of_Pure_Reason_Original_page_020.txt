As already suggested, this di­ vision is the basis for Kant's division of the "Transcendental Doctrine of Elements" into the "Transcendental Aesthetic," which deals with sensi­ bility and its pure form, and the "Transcendental Logic," which deals with the operations of the understanding and judgment as well as both the spurious and the legitimate activities of theoretical reason.
 
 "Transcendental Aesthetic": space, time, and transcendental idealism. Despite its brevity -a mere thirty pages in the first edition and forty in the second -the "Transcendental Aesthetic" argues for a series of striking, paradoxical and even revolutionary theses that deter­ mine the course of the whole remainder of the Critique and that have been the subject of a very large proportion of the scholarly work de­ voted to the Critique in the last two centuries. '3 In this section, Kant at­ tempts to distinguish the contribution to cognition made by our receptive faculty of sensibility from that made solely by the objects that affect us (A2 1-2/B 36), and argues that space and time are pure forms of all intuition contributed by our own faculty of sensibility, and therefore forms of which we can have a priori knowledge. This is the basis for Kant's resolution of the debate about space and time that had raged be­ tween the Newtonians, who held space and time to be self-subsisting entities existing independently of the objects that occupy them, and the Leibnizians, who held space and time to be systems of relations, con­ ceptual constructs based on non-relational properties inhering in the things we think of as spatiotemporally related. '4 Kant's alternative to both of these positions is that space and time are neither subsistent be­ ings nor inherent in things as they are in themselves, but are rather only forms of our sensibility, hence conditions under which objects of expe­ rience can be given at all and the fundamental principle of their repre­ sentation and individuation. Only in this way, Kant argues, can we adequately account for the necessary manifestation of space and time throughout all experience as single but infinite magnitudes -the fea­ ture of experience that Newton attempted to account for with his meta­ physically incoherent notion of absolute space and time as the sensorium dei -and also explain the a priori yet synthetic character of the mathe­ matical propositions expressing our cognition of the physical properties of quantities and shapes given in space and time -the epistemological certainty undercut by Leibniz's account of space and time as mere rela­ tions abstracted from antecedently existing objects (A 22-5 I B 37-41, A 30—2 IB46-9).
 
 Kant's thesis that space and time are pure forms of intuition leads him to the paradoxical conclusion that although space and time are empiri­ cally real, they are transcendentally ideal, and so are the objects given in !hem. Although the precise meaning of this claim remains subject to de7 Introduction bate,'5 in general terms it is the claim that it is only from the human standpoint that we can speak of space, time, and the spatiotemporality of the objects of experience, thus that we cognize these things not as they are in themselves but only as they appear under the conditions of our sensibility (A26-30/B42-5, A 32-48/B49-73).
