On the empirical use of the regulative principle cannot in itself be either of these, because appearance is not a thing in itself, a perception of boundedness through absolutely empty time or empty space would have to be possible, through which these world­ ends would have to be given in a possible experience. But such an ex­ perience, as completely empty of content, is impossible. Thus an abso­ lute boundary of the world is empirically impossible, and hence also absolutely impossible.* From this follows at the same time the affirmative answer: The regress in the series of appearances in the world, as a determination of the magnitude of the world, goes on in indefinitum, which is as much as to say that the world of sense has no absolute magnitude, but the em­ pirical regress (through which alone it can be given on the side of its conditions) has its rule, namely always to progress from each member of the series, as a conditioned, to a still more remote member (whether by means of one's own experience, or the guiding thread of history, or AS2 2 / B 550 the chain of effects and their causes), and nowhere to exceed the extension of the possible empirical use of one's understanding, since this extension is the sole and proper business of reason in its principles.a What is not prescribed here is a determinate empirical regress that continues in a certain kind of appearance without ever ceasing, e.g., that from a living human being one must always ascend in the series of his ancestors without ever expecting a first pair, or in the series of bodies in the world without admitting an outermost sun; on the contrary, what is required is only the progress from appearances to appearances, even if they should not yield any actual perception (if this perception is too weak in degree to become an experience for our consciousness), because despite this they would still belong to possible experience.76 Every beginning is in time, and every boundary of the extended is in space. Space and time, however, are only in the world of sense. Hence appearances are in the world only conditionally, the world itself is nei­ ther conditioned nor bounded in an unconditional way.
 
 Just for this reason, and since the world cannot be given as a whole, and even the series of conditions for a given conditioned, as a world­ series, cannot be given as a whole, the concept of the magnitude of * One will note that the proof is carried on here in an entirely different way AS 2 I / B 549 from the dogmatic one in the antithesis of the first antinomy. There, in accordance with the common and dogmatic way of representing it, we let the world of sense count as a thing whose totality is given in itself prior to any regress, and, if it did not occupy all space and all time, we denied it any determinate place in space and time. Hence the conclusion was different from this one too: namely, the actual infinity of the world was inferred.
