Systematic representation of all synthetic principles tion of a thing from one state into another) is also continuous could be B 2 I 3 proved here easily and with mathematical self-evidence, if the causality of an alteration in general did not lie entirely beyond the boundaries of a transcendental philosophy and presuppose empirical principles.a For the understanding gives us no inkling a priori that a cause is possible which alters the state of things, i.e., determines them to the opposite of a certain given state, not merely because it simply does not give us insight into the possibility of this (for this insight is lacking in many a priori cognitions), but rather because alterability concerns only certain determinations of appearances, about which experience alone can teach us, while their cause is to be found in the unalterable. But since we have before us here nothing that we can use except the pure fundamental concepts of all possible experience, in which there must be nothing at all empirical, we cannot anticipate general natural science, which is built upon certain fundamental experiences, without injuring the unity of the system. A I 72 Nevertheless, we are not lacking proofs of the great influence that our principle has in anticipating perceptions, and even in making good their absence insofar as it draws the bolt against all the false inferences that might be drawn from that.
 
 If all reality in perception has a degree, between which and negation B 2 I4 there is an infinite gradation of ever lesser degrees, and if likewise every sense must have a determinate degree of receptivity for the sensations, then no perception, hence also no experience, is possible that, whether immediately or mediately (through whatever detour in inference one might want), would prove an entire absence of everything real in apÂ­ pearance, i.e., a proof of empty space or of empty time can never be drawn from experience. For, first, the entire absence of the real in sensible intuition cannot itself be perceived, and, second, it cannot be deduced from any single appearance and the difference in the degree of its reality, nor may it ever be assumed for the explanation of that. For even if the entire intuition of a determinate space or time is real through and through, i.e., no part of it is empty, yet, since every reality has its degree that can decrease to nothing (emptiness) through infinite steps while the A I 73 extensive magnitude of the appearance remains unaltered, it must yield infinitely different degrees with which space or time is filled, and the intensive magnitude in different appearances can be smaller or greater even though the extensive magnitude of the intuition remains identical.
 
 We will give an example of this.
