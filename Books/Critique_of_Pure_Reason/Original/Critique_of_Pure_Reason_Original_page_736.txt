In the first draft of the introduction to the Critique of Judgment, however, Kant suggests that there is little content to the "general theory of time" (20:237).

 38 Berkeley typically attacks the reality of matter rather than of space and time themselves; thus Kant would appear to be closer to the mark in the last part of this sentence than in the earlier part, in which he seems to suggest that Berkeley's idealism results from the supposition that there are contradic­ tions inherent in the idea of space and time themselves as self-subsisting entities. In The Principles of Human Knowledge §§ 98-9, however, Berkeley does object to the "attempt to frame a simple idea of time, abstracted from the succession of ideas in my mind, which flows uniformly, and is partici­ pated in by all beings," and likewise to the attempt to "abstract extension and motion from all other qualities" (The Works of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, ed. A. A. Luce and T E.Jessop [Edinburgh: Nelson, 1949], vol. II, pp. 83-4). Here Berkeley comes closer to the reasoning Kant imputes to him.

 2 An early account of the restrictions on what Kant was later to call "general logic" may be found at R 1599 (1769-70, 16:29-30); see also R 1608 (1776-78, 16:34). Other precursors of the present passage from the same pe­ riod are R 3946 (17:350-60) and R 3949 (17:361). For later comments, see R 1624 (1780s, 16:42) and R 1647 (179os, 16:43).

 3 Kant would appear to have derived this figure from the Greek satirist Lucian of Samosata (b. ca. 120 A.D.), who writes in his dialogue Demonax, 723 Notes to pages 198-220 section 28, line 5: "Once when he [Demonax, a supposed Cynic sage] came upon two uncouth philosophers inquiring and wrangling with one an­ other -one of them putting absurd questions, the other answering per­ fectly irrelevantly -he said 'Don't you think, my friends, that one of these guys is milking a he-goat and the other putting a sieve underneath it?
