For the advantage that has made it so successful logic has solely its own limitation to thank, since it is thereby justified in abstracting -is indeed obliged to abstract -from all objectsb of cognition and all the distinctions between them; and in logic, therefore, the understanding has to do with nothing further than itself and its own form. How much more difficult, naturally, must it be for reason to enter upon the secure path of a science if it does not have to do merely with itself, but has to deal with objectsC too; hence logic as a propadeutic constitutes only the outer courtyard, as it were, to the sciences; and when it comes to infor­ mation, a logic may indeed be presupposed in judging about the latter, but its acquisition must be sought in the sciences properly and objec­ tively so called.
 
 Insofar as there is to be reason in these sciences, something in them must be cognized a priori, and this cognition can relate to its object in either of two ways, either merely determining the object and its con­ BX cept (which must be given from elsewhere), or else also making the ob­ ject actual. The former is theoretical, the latter practical cognition of reason. In both the pure part, the part in which reason determines its objecti wholly a priori, must be expounded all by itself, however much or little it may contain, and that part that comes from other sources must not be mixed up with it; for it is bad economy to spend blindly whatever comes in without being able later, when the economy comes to a standstill, to distinguish the part of the revenue that can cover the expenses from the part that must be cut.
 
 Mathematics and physics are the two theoretical cognitions of rea­ son that are supposed to determine their objectse a priori, the former entirely purely, the latter at least in part purely but also following the standards of sources of cognition other than reason.
 
 Mathematics has, from the earliest times to which the history of human reason reaches, in that admirable people the Greeks, traveled the secure path of a science. Yet it must not be thought that it was as easy for it as for logic -in which reason has to do only with itself -to find that royal path, or rather itself to open it up; rather, I believe that Bxi mathematics was left groping about for a long time (chiefly among the Egyptians), and that its transformation is to be ascribed to a revolu­ tion, brought about by the happy inspiration of a single man in an ata Object Objecte b , Objecte d Object , Objecte 107 Preface tempt from which the road to be taken onward could no longer be missed, and the secure course of a science was entered on and pre­ scribed for all time and to an infinite extent.
