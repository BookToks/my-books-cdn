4 Although Kant had introduced a distinction between the analytic method of philosophy and the synthetic method of mathematics as early as the Inquiry concerning the distinctness of the principles of natural theology and moral­ ity, written in 1762 and published in 1764 (see its First Reflection, § I, 2:276), his distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments was pub­ licly introduced for the first time in the following passage of the Critique of Pure Reason. However, the appearance of the distinction in the Critique was the product of a long gestation. The distinction appears in Kant's margin­ alia to his copy of Baumgarten's Metaphysica as early as 1764-66, e.g., R 3738 (17:278-<) , and recurs throughout the years in which the Critique was evolving, as in 1769, e.g., R 3923 (17:348) and R 3928 (17:350-1), and again in 1772, e.g., R 4477 (17:566). An extensive discussion of the distinc­ tion appears in R 4634 (17:616-19), a note from 1773-76. Extensive use of the distinction is also to be found in the loose sheets of the so-called Duisburg Nachlafi of 1774-75, e.g., R 4674 (17:643-7), R 4675 (17:648-53), R 4767 (17:653-7), R 4683 (17:669-70), and R 4684 (17:670-3). In Kant's notes in Georg Friedrich Meier's logic textbook (Auszug aus der Vernunft­ lehre), see also R 3127 (1764-68) and 3128 (1769-70) (16:671), R 3042 (1773-75?; 16:629) and 3136 (1776-78 or 1780s, 16:674). After the publi­ ' cation of the Critique, the distinction was at the center of the debate be­ tween Kant and the neo-Leibnizian J. A. Eberhard; see Henry E. Allison, The Kant-Eberhard Controversy (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973), especially his translation from Kant's On a discovery according to which any new Critique of Pure Reason has been made superfluous by an earlier one, 20:228-33 (Allison, pp. 141-5). Even in his latest writings, Kant was still ex­ ploring the distinction; see, e.g., Opus postumu11l, VII.rv.I, 22=40-1 (in Immanuel Kant, Opus postumum, edited by Eckart Forster [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993], pp. 177-78).
 
 5 With this paragraph, compare specifically R 4634 (1772-76, 17:616-19) and R 4676 (1773-75, 17:653-7).
 
 6 Compare this with the definition at R 4851 (1776-78, 18:10): "Cognition is called transcendental with regard to its origin, transcendent with regard to the object [Objects] that cannot be encountered in any experience." See also R 4890 (1776-78, 18:20).
 
 7 R 2740 and 2741 (16:494).
 
 8 See R 4851 (18:8-10).
 
 9 In Metaphysik Mrongovius, Kant draws a similar distinction between the a priori simpliciter and the a priori secundum quid, where the latter is "cognized through reason but from empirical principles" (29:751).
 
 10 Compare R 3955 (17:364), from 1769. At R 4993 (1776-78; 18:54-5), Kant suggests that philosophy has both pure and empirical parts, a claim crucial to his eventual distinction between the critiques of theoretical and practi­ cal reason on the one hand and the metaphysics of nature and morals on the other, so the present suggestion that there is such a thing as impure but a priori cognition should not be overlooked. See also R 5048 (1776-78; 18:72).
