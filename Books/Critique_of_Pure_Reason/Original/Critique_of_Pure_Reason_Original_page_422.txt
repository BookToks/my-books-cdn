For in fact no concept of the understanding is possible for an object that is to be adequate to the demand of reason, i.e., an object such as can be shown and made intuitive in a possible experience. But we would ex­ A339 press ourselves better and with less danger of misunderstanding if we B397 said that we can have no acquaintance with an objecta that corresponds to an idea, even though we can have a problematic concept of it.
 
 Now at least the transcendental (subjective) reality of pure concepts of reason rests on the fact that we are brought to such ideas by a neces­ sary syllogism. Thus there will be syllogisms containing no empirical premises, by means of which we can infer from something with which we are acquainted to something of which we have no concept, and yet to which we nevertheless, by an unavoidable illusion, give objective re­ ality. In respect of their result, such inferences are thus to be called so­ phistical rather than rational inferences; b even though they might lay claim to the latter term on account of what occasions them, because they are not thought up, nor do they arise contingently, but have sprung from the nature of reason. They are sophistriesc not of human beings but of pure reason itself, and even the wisest of all human beings can­ not get free of them; perhaps after much effort he may guard himself from error, but he can never be wholly rid of the illusion, which cease­ lessly teases and mocks him.
 
 There are, therefore, only three species of these dialectical syllo­ gisms, as many as there are ideas in which their conclusions result. In the first class of syllogisms, from the transcendental concept of a sub­ ject that contains nothing manifold I infer the absolute unity of this a Object vernunftelnde, als Vernunftschlusse, which could also be translated "rationalizing rather b than rational inferences" or "sophistical inferences rather than syllogisms." , Sophistikationen 409 Doctrine of Elements.
