This argument, showing that the categories must be applied to representations given in space and time in order to yield unity of consciousness and objective experi­ ence of objects, would have the consequence that by concepts "we cog­ nize only objects of the senses," thus that the categories "do not reach to the supersensible." It would then be the burden of the second main part of the work, which Kant had already been referring to as a "Dialectic" for some years, to show that "Even though the concepts [of the pure under­ standing] extend to all objects of thought in general," "they do not yield any amplification of theoretical cognition," but may nevertheless have a "practical-dogmatic" role in a "practical regard, where freedom is the condition of their use."'56 Now Kant divides this critical part of the work into three divisions. He argues that it is characteristic of pure rea­ son to assume as a "petition" or "postulate" the principle that "All con­ ditioned cognition not only stands under conditions, but finally under one which is itself unconditioned," or that "If the conditioned is given, then the entire series of all its conditions is also given."'57 He now ar­ gues that because there are three kinds of rational inference, from a property to its subject, from a property to another property, and from a property to its ground, there must be three dialectical inferences back to an unconditioned or absolute substance, an unconditioned or ab­ solute whole, and an unconditioned or absolute ground. Thus reason postulates "the unconditioned subjective conditions of thinking, the un­ conditioned (objective) condition of appearances, and the uncondi­ tioned objective condition of all things in general."'58 These three inferences, which Kant will discuss in the Critique under the titles of the "Paralogism," the "Antinomy," and the "Ideal of Pure Reason," will be diagnosed as theoretically unjustified, because the underlying principle, that whenever the conditioned is given so is its ultimate condition, is theoretically unjustified. Nevertheless these three ideas of the uncondi­ tioned will be useful in a practical context.
 
 Even in the Critique Kant will retain the argument that the three forms of "transcendental illusion" arise from three forms of infer­ ence, '59 but he also suggests both in these notes and in the published work that they arise directly from an unwarranted reification of the three concepts of a subject, a series, and a ground,,6o and it is easier to understand his diagnosis in these terms. Thus, the three fundamental errors of metaphysics are the assumptions (I) that because we assign all of our thoughts to our selves as subjects, we have knowledge of the soul as an absolute subject; (2) that because we place all appearances in se63 1 Introduction ries of ever increasing spaces and times, of ever decreasing spaces and times, of causes and effects, and of contingents necessarily dependent upon something else, we have knowledge of completed extensions in space and time, of simples in space and time, of a first cause, and of a necessary ground for all contingents; and (3) that because we must think of some ground for any possibility, we have knowledge of an absolute ground of all possibilities.
