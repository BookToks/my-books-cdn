Systematic representation of all synthetic principles hended, therefore, i.e., taken up into empirical consciousness, except through the synthesis of the manifold through which the representa­ tions of a determinate space or time are generated, i.e., through the composition of that which is homogeneous a and the consciousness of the synthetic unity of this manifold (of the homogeneous). Now the B 203 consciousness of the homogeneous mal1ifol<:l�_il!: iE�tion in general, inso"f:ir as through it the representation of an objectC fi;st bC(;9meS possible, is the concept of a magnitude (Quanti). Thus even the perception of an object,d as appea�ance, is possible only through the same synthetic unity of the manifold of given sensible intuition through which the unity of the composition of the homogeneous manifold is thought in the concept of a magnitude, i.e., the appearances are all magnitudes, and indeed extensive magnitudes, since as intuitions in space or time they must be represented through the same synthesis as that through which space and time in general are determined.> I call an extensive magnitude that in which the representation of the A 162 parts makes possible the representation of the whole (and therefore necessarily precedes the latter).62 I cannot represent to myself any line, no matter how small it may be, without drawing it in thought, i.e., suc­ cessively generating all its parts from one point, and thereby first sketching this intuition. It is exactly the same with even the smallest AI63 time. I think therein only the successive progress from one moment to another, where through all parts of time and their addition a determiof quantity, while Griffie as quantum refers to "eine Griffie in concreto" (pp. 298, 300).
 
 This distinction can be marked in English as that between "quantity" and "magnitude." However, we will follow our practice in earlier sections, using "magnitude" as the trans­ lation of Grofe and reserving "quantity" for Quantitiit.
 
 The following notes are inserted in Kant's copy of the first edition at the start of this d section: "One must subsume the perceptions under the categories. But one can infer noth­ ing from those categories themselves, but only from the possibility of perception, which can only happen through the determination of time and in time, in which the act [Actus] that determines the intuition is possible only in accordance with a category." (E LXVI, p. 29; 23:28) "Since we can all arrange perceptions only through apprehension in time, but this is a synthesis of the homogeneous, which the concept of magnitude corresponds to in the unity of consciousness, we cannot cognize the objects of outer and inner sense other­ wise than as magnitudes in experience. Limitation of the concept of magnitude." (E LXVII, p. 30; 23=28-9) , The heading "Proof" and the following paragraph were added in the second edition.
