For earlier accounts of intuition, see R 3955, 3957, 3958, and 3961 (1769, 17=364-7).
 
 3 On the contrast between intuition and sensation, see R 4636 (1772-76, 17:619-20). More generally, on Kant's classification of the various forms of cognitive states, see the inaugural dissertation, § 5 (2:394); R 619-20 (1769, 15:268); R 2835-6 (1773-77, 16:536-40); and the scheme given at A 320/B 367 below, as well as the further reflections noted there.
 
 4 Kant refers in this note to Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1711-1762), who was not only the author of the textbooks on metaphysics and ethics on which Kant based his lecture courses in those subjects, but also the au­ thor of the two works which introduced and gave currency to the term "aesthetics" used in its modern sense, i.e., as the name for the philosophy of art and/or beauty; these works were Baumgarten's dissertation Medi­ tationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus (Halle, 1735), and the two-volume though uncompleted Aesthetica (Halle, 1750 and 1758). It is not clear whether Kant was acquainted with Baumgarten's aesthetic the­ ory firsthand or through the three-volume work in German published by Baumgarten's disciple Georg Friedrich Meier, Die Anfangsgriinde alter schijnen Kiinste und Wissenschaften (Halle, 1748-50) (Meier was also the au­ thor of the textbook used in Kant's logic courses). In any case, although in the present footnote Kant evinced a hostility to Baumgarten's new usage which he modified only slightly in the revisions of this note in the second edition, by 1790 Kant had accepted Baumgarten's usage, and so entitled the section of the Critique of Judgment of that year dealing with what he here says should be called the "critique of taste" the "Critique of Aes­ thetic Judgment." For comments on :Baumgarten, see R 5081 (1776-78, 18:81-2). For further critical comm6nts about the status of aesthetics in Baumgarten's (and the modern) sense, see R 1578, 1579, 1587, 1588 (1760s, 16:16-23, 26-7), R 4276 (1770-71, 17:492), and R 5063 (1776-78, 18:76-7).

 12 Kant suggests a quite different argument for this point in the Opus postu­ mum, where he states that it is because space is a form of intuition that it must be infinite; the unstated premise is presumably that no matter how much is given to us, we must always be able to represent it spatially because space is the form of intuition of outer objects. Of course, this might be thought to presuppose the proof that space is a form of intuition which is still being given here.
