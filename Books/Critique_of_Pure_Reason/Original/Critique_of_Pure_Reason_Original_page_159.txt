g., in the proposition "The world must have a first beginning," and others be­ sides, and thus metaphysics, at least as far as its end is concerned, con­ sists of purely synthetic a priori propositions. 20 BI9 VI.
 
 The general problema of pure reason.21 One has already gained a great deal if one can bring a multitude of in­ vestigations under the formula of a single problem. For one thereby not only lightens one's own task, by determining it precisely, but also the judgment of anyone else who wants to examine whether we have satis­ fied our plan or not. The real problem of pure reason is now contained in the question: How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?
 
 That metaphysics has until now remained in such a vacillating state of uncertainty and contradictions is to be ascribed solely to the cause that no one has previously thought of this problem and perhaps even of the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments. On the so­ lution of this problem, or on a satisfactory proof that the possibility that it demands to have explained does not in fact exist at all, metaphysics now stands or falls. David Hume, who among all philosophers came closest to this problem, still did not conceive of it anywhere near deter­ minately enough and in its universality, but rather stopped with the syn­ thetic proposition of the connection of the effect with its cause B 20 (Principium causalitatis), believing himself to have brought out that such an a priori proposition is entirely impossible, and according to his in­ ferences everything that we call metaphysics would come down to a mere delusion of an alleged insight of reason into that which has in fact merely been borrowed from experience and from habit has taken on the appearance of necessity; an assertion, destructive of all pure philosophy, on which he would never have fallen if he had had our problem in its generality before his eyes, since then he would have comprehended that according to his argument there could also be no pure mathematics, since this certainly contains synthetic a priori propositions, an assertion a Aufgabe 146 Introduction <B> from which his sound understanding would surely have protected him.
