64 We will describe the contents of the inaugural dissertation in some detail, since it will be helpful in reading the Critique to see exactly what Kant could retain from the earlier work and what had to be fundamen­ tally revised. Kant signals the importance of the problem of the antino­ mies from the outset, opening the work with the statement that "just as analysis does not come to an end until a part is reached which is not a whole, that is to say a SIMPLE, so likewise synthesis does not come to an end until we reach a whole which is not a part, that is to say a WORLD."6s He then argues that since the world of appearances is given with space and time as its form, and space and time are continu­ ous quantities, there can be "no limit" in analysis or the "regression from the whole to the parts" nor in synthesis or composition, "the progression from the parts to the given whole,"66 and thus no satisfaction of the opening definition of a simple and a world; but since the pure concepts of the intellect give us access to a realm of things with their own princi­ ples of form, where parts are not spatiotemporal regions and the princi­ ple of composition is not that of spatiotemporal extension, but where instead the parts are substances and the principle of composition is the common dependence of substances upon God, the conditions for meta­ physical knowledge of both simples and a single world of them can be satisfied. The remainder of the work is then divided into a fuller state­ ment of the distinctions between intuition and concept and phenomena and noumena (Section 2); separate expositions of the fundamental forms of intuition or sensibility (Section 3) and of the laws of understanding (Section 4); and the concluding argument that the limits of sensibility must not be mistaken to preclude metaphysical knowledge through the intellect (Section 5). Section 3 is taken over into the Critique of Pure Reason without essential modification, but Section 4 will be radically re­ vised by the mature theory of the function of the understanding in the Critique, and once that revision is made there must also be fundamental revision in the treatment of the antinomies in Section 5.
 
 In Section 2, Kant first introduces his distinction between sensi­ bility, which is characterized as the "receptivity of the subject in virtue of which it is possible for the subject's own representative state to be af­ fected in a definite way by the presence of some object," and what he here calls "intelligence (or rationality)," "the faculty of a subject in virtue of which it has the power to represent things which cannot by their own quality come before the senses";67 he also calls this faculty "intellect" (intellectus).68 Next, he argues "that things which are thought sensitively are representations of things as they appear, while things which are in­ tellectual are representations of things as they are."69 Kant's reasons for this momentous claim are far from clear. He suggests two reasons: 38 Introduction first, that "whatever in cognition is sensitive" should be considered as "dependent upon the subject insofar as the subject is capable of this or that modification by the presence of objects," where it is assumed that different subjects may be modified by or respond to the same objects in different ways, and thus cannot all represent the objects as they really are; and second, that "objects do not strike the senses in virtue of their form or aspect," but only in virtue of their matter, thus "the form of .
