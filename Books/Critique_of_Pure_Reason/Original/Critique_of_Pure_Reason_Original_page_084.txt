To character­ ize the nature of the changes that Kant made in any detail would be an interpretative venture inappropriate for this introduction, but a few points can be noted. First, in spite of his experiments with an apper­ ception-free deduction in I783 and I786, Kant in fact tried to ground the entire deduction more clearly on the starting-point of the unity of apperception than he had in I78I. At the same time, trying to salvage his experiments of the intervening years, he also tried to connect the unity of apperception more unequivocally with the idea of the objective validity of judgment than he had in the earlier version. Second, Kant tried to prepare the way for the coming new "Refutation of Idealism" by stressing that the cognitive subject must be regarded as determining the structure and order of its own self-consciousness just as much as it does to the representation of external objects (§§ 23-5)' Finally, con­ tinuing the stress on the necessity of the representation of space that was part of the Prolegomena's response to the charge of Berkeleian ide­ alism, Kant stresses that the synthetic unity of consciousness, which in the first edition had been associated exclusively with the synthesis of time, is responsible for the unity of both space and time, and indeed that the representation of determinate spatial relations is a necessary condi­ tion for the representation of a determinate temporal order, which is an undeniable feature of any conceivable self-consciousness (see B I56).
 
 (5) The argument that while time is the form of all sense, the repre­ sentation of space is itself the necessary condition for the representation of determinate order in time, which continues Kant's rebuttal of the charge of Berkeleian idealism, is the chief theme of all of the revisions in the "Analytic of Principles." These revisions take the form of re­ statements of the several principles of judgment, and of additional para­ graphs at the start of each of the proofs; but Kant's most important addition to this part of the book is the new "Refutation of Idealism" that is inserted into the discussion of actuality in the "Postulates of Empirical Thought" (B 274-9). This may seem like an inauspicious lo­ cation for such an addition, but Kant's intention in choosing it can only have been to show that empirically meaningful judgments about the modalities of possibility and necessity all depend upon connection to the actual in perception, and then to show what he means by the actual in perception: that which we judge to exist independently of our repre­ sentation of it, even if we also know that the form in which we represent the independence of such objects is itself dependent upon the constitu­ tion of our own sensibility. The "Refutation of Idealism," in other 71 Introduction words, is Kant's ultimate attempt to prove that his idealism is merely for­ mal idealism rather than the subjective realism of Berkeley.
