Thus in this proposition there is already no longer merely spon- B430 taneity of thinking, but also receptivity of intuition, i.e., the thinking of my self applied to the empirical intuition of the very same subject. It is in this latter that the thinking self must now seek the conditions of the use of its logical functions for categories of substance, cause, etc., so as not merely to indicate itself as objectC in itself through the "I," but also to determine its kind of existence, i.e., to cognize it as noumenon; which, however, is impossible, since inner empirical intuition is sensible, and makes available nothing but data of appearance, which affords nothing for knowledge of the separate existence of the objectd of pure con­ sciousness, but can serve merely in behalf of experience.
 
 But suppose there subsequently turned up -not in experience but in certain (not merely logical rules but) laws holding firm a priori and con­ cerning our existence -the occasion for presupposing ourselves to be legislative fully a priori in regard to our own existence, and as self-de­ e termining in this existence! then this would disclose a spontaneity through which our actuality is determinable without the need of condi­ tions of empirical intuition; and here we would become aware that in the consciousness of our existence something is ,�ontained a priori that can serve to determine our existence, which is thoroughly determinable B 431 only sensibly, in regard to a certain inner faculty in relation to an intelligible world (obviously one only thought of).
 
 But this would nonetheless bring all the attempts of rational psy­ chology not the least bit further. For through this admirable faculty, which for the first time reveals to me the consciousness of the moral law, I would indeed have a principleg for the determination of my existence that is purely intellectual; but through which predicates?
 
 Through none other than those that would have to be given to me in sensible intuition, and thus I would have landed right back where I was in rational psychology, namely in need of sensible intuitions in order to obtain significance for my concepts of the understanding, substance, cause, etc.; but those intuitions can never help me up beyond the field a Object Object b , Object Object d , Dasein f Existenz Princip g 457 Doctrine of Elements.
