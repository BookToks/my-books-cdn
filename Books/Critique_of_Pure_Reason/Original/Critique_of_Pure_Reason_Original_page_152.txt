But what says still more than all the foregoing' is this, that certain cognitions even abandon the field of all possible experiences, and seem A 3 to expand the domain of our judgments beyond all bounds of experi�nce through concepts to which no corresponding object at all can be given in experience.
 
 And precisely in these latter cognitions, which go beyond the world of the senses, where experience can give neither guidance nor correction, lie the investigations of our reason that we hold to be far more preeminent in their importance and sublime in their final aim than B 7 everything that the understanding can learn in the field of appearances, in which we would rather venture everything, even at the risk of erring, than give up such important investigations because of any sort of reser­ vation or from contempt and indifference. dThese unavoidable problems of pure reason itself are God, freedom and immortality. But the science whose final aim in all its preparations is directed properly only to the solution of these problems is called metaphysics, whose procedure is in the beginning dogmatic, i.e., it confidently takes on the exe­ cution of this task without an antecedent examination of the capacity or incapacitye of reason for such a great undertaking.
 
 Now it may seem natural that as soon as one has abandoned the terrain of experience one would not immediately erect an edifice with cog­ nitions that one possesses without knowing whence, and on the credit of principles whose origin one does not know, without having first as­ sured oneself of its foundation through careful investigations, thus that one would all the morefhave long since raised the question how the un­ derstanding could come to all these cognitions a priori and what do­ main, validity, and value they might have. And in fact nothing is more A4 natural, if one understands by the word naturalg that which properly and reasonably ought to happen; but if one understands by it that which B 8 usually happens, then conversely nothing is more natural and comprea This section number and title added in the second edition.
