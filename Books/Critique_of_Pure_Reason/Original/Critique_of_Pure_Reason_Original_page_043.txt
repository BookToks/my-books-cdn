4' The introduction of God as the ground Qf all possibility must have seemed to Kant logically sounder than the ontological argument and the­ ologically more orthodox than the Leibnizian conception, on which the power of God in the creation of the universe is constrained by the an­ tecedent existence of determinate possible worlds. But in the Critique of Pure Reason Kant was ultimately to reject this argument as well as the three traditional ones, and to argue that both the existence and predicates of God could only be demonstrated on moral grounds, as practical be­ liefs rather than theoretical dogmas (A8ro-r6/B838-44; A828-9/ B 856-7). Nevertheless, the underlying idea of Kant's argument, that a genuine or "real possibility" is not established just by demonstrating that a concept is free from contradiction but must have some sort of affirma­ tive ground in actual existence, was remarkably deep-seated in Kant's thought, and would manifest itself again not just in the structure of Kant's theoretical philosophy but at crucial points in his practical philos­ ophy as well.
 
 The second main section of the Only Possible Basis shows Kant's early concern to find a proper characterization of scientific laws of nature, and reveals that Kant's complex view of teleology, or final causes, which seems to be a late accretion to the Critique of Pure Reason, touched on only in the appendix to the "Transcendental Dialectic" (A642-704/ B670-732) and fully developed only in the Critique of Judgment, was ac­ tually a longstanding part of his thought. Against the background of the debate between occasionalism and preestablished harmony, Kant argues that God's purposes for the world would be expressed through unchang­ ing natural laws valid throughout its entire history, and not through any miraculous episodic interventions: "Where nature operates in accor­ dance with necessary laws, there will be no need for God to correct the course of events by direct intervention; for, in virtue of the necessity of the effects that occur in accordance with the order of nature, that which is displeasing to God cannot occur."42 Thus Kant argues "That in the procedure of purified philosophy there prevails a rule which, even if it is not formally stated, is nonetheless always observed in practice . . .t hat in investigating the causes of certain effects one must pay careful attention to maintaining the unity of nature as far as possible."43 Here Kant defined an ideal of human knowledge that was to be cen­ tral to the Critique of Pure Reason and all of his subsequent works, even as its theological foundation in a conception of God became ever more attenuated. To have knowledge of the events of an objective world be­ yond one's own consciousness is to subsume those events under causal laws, and to have knowledge of causal laws is to conceive of those laws 30 Introduction as themselves part of a system of laws that, if not actually created by God, can nevertheless only be conceived by us as if they had been cre­ ated by an intelligence like but more powerful than ours.
