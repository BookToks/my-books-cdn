Proof Suppose that either the world itself is a necessary being or that there is such a being in it; then in the series of its alterations either there would be a beginning that is unconditionally necessary, and hence without a cause, which conflicts with the dynamic law of the determination of all appearances in time; or else the series itself would be without any be­ ginning, and, although contingent and conditioned in all its parts, it would nevertheless be absolutely necessary and unconditioned as a whole, which contradicts itself, because the existence of a multiplicity cannot be necessary if no single part of it possesses an existence neces­ sary in itself.
 
 Suppose, on the contrary, that there were an absolutely necessary cause of the world outside the world; then this cause, as the supreme A4SS/B483 member in the series of causes of alterations in the world, would first begin these changes and their series.* But it would have to begin to act then, and its causality would belong in time, and for this very reason in the sum total of appearances, i.e., in the world; consequently, it itself, the cause, would not be outside the world, which contradicts what was presupposed. Thus neither in the world nor outside it (yet in causal connection with it) is there any absolutely necessary being.
 
 * The word "begin" is taken in two significations. The first is active, as when the cause begins (infit) a series of states as its effect. The second is passive, as when the causality in the cause itself commences (fit). I infer here from the former to the latter.
