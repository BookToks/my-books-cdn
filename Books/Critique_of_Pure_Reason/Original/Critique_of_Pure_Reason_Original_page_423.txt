Pt. II. Div. II. Book II subject itself, even though in this way I have no concept at all of it. This dialectical inference I will call a transcendental paralogism. The sec­ ond class of sophistical inference is applied in general to the transcen­ dental concept of absolute totality in the series of conditions for a given appearance; and from the fact that I always have a self-contradictory concept of the unconditioned synthetic unity in the series on one side, I infer the correctness of the opposite unity, even though I also have no concept of it. I will call the condition of reason with regard to these di­ alectical inferences the antinomy of pure reason. Finally, in the third kind of sophistical inference, from the totality of conditions for think­ ing objects in general insofar as they can be given to me I infer the ab­ solute synthetic unity of all conditions for the possibility of things in general; i.e., from things with which I am not acquainted as to their merely transcendental concept, I infer a being of all beings, with which I am even less acquainted through its transcendental a concept, and of whose unconditioned necessity I can make for myself no concept at all.
 
 This dialectical syllogism I will call the ideal of pure reason.
