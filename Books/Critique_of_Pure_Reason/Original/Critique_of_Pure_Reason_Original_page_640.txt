alfI regard the sum total of all cognition of pure and speculative rea- A 707 / B 735 son as an edifice for which we have in ourselves at least the idea, then I can say that in the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements we have made an estimate of the building materials and determined for what sort of edifice, with what height and strength, they would suffice. It turned out, of course, that although we had in mind a tower that would reach the heavens, the supply of materials sufficed only for a dwelling that was just roomy enough for our business on the plane of experience and high enough to survey it; however, that bold undertaking had to fail from lack of material, not to mention the confusion of languages that unavoidably divided the workers over the plan and dispersed them throughout the world, leaving each to build on his own according to his own design. I Now we are concerned not so much with the materials as with the plan, and, having been warned not to venture some arbitrary and blind project that might entirely exceed our entire capacity,b yet not being able to abstain from the erection of a sturdy dwelling, we have to aim at an edifice in relatione to the supplies given to us that is at the same time suited to our needs.
 
 By the transcendental doctrine of method, therefore, I understand the determination of the formal conditions of a complete system of A 708/ B 736 pure reason. With this aim, we shall have to concern ourselves with a discipline, a canon, an architectonic, and finally a history of pure reason,2 and will accomplish, in a transcendental respect, that which, under the name of a practical logic,3 with regard to the use of the understanding in general, the schools sought but accomplished only badly; for since general logic is not limited to any particular kind of cognition of the understanding (e.g., not to the pure cognition of the understanding) nor to certain objects, it cannot, without borrowing knowledge from other sciences, do more than expound titles for possible methods and technical expressions that are used in regard to that which is systematic in all sorts of sciences, which first makes the novice familiar with names the significance and use of which he will only learn in the future.
 
 a Throughout this part of the work there are minor changes in orthography between the two editions, very few of which affect the translation. Only the few that do will be noted.
 
 Vermijgen b , Verhdltnis 627 The Transcendental Doctrine of Method A708/B736 First Chapter The discipline of pure reason 4 In humanity's general lust for knowledge, negative judgments, which are negative not merely on the basis of logical form but also on the basis of their content, do not stand in high regard: one regards them as jealÂ­ ous enemies of our unremitting drive straining for the expansion of our A 709/ B 737 cognition, and it almost takes an apology to earn toleration for them, let alone favor and esteem.
