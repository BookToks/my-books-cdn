This argu­ ment is the basis for Kant's theory of the regulative use of the ideas of reason in scientific inquiry, which Kant first suggests in the final ap­ pendix to the "Transcendental Dialectic" and then elaborates in the Critique of Judgment, and for his theory of the foundation of morality in the practical use of pure reason, which he first describes in the "Doc­ trine of Method" and elaborates in many subsequent works, but espe­ cially in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the Critique of Practical Reason.
 
 The Leibnizian-Wolffian tradition, as presented in Alexander Gott­ lieb Baumgarten's Metaphysica (first edition, 1738), which Kant used as the textbook for his lectures on metaphysics for virtually his entire ca­ reer, was divided into four parts: ontology, psychology, cosmology, and theology. The "Transcendental Aesthetic" and "Analytic" are Kant's critical replacement for traditional ontology. The "Transcendental Dialectic," however, is dedicated to arguing that the other three parts of the rationalist system are pseudo-sciences founded on inevitable illu­ sions of human reason attempting to extend itself beyond the limits of sensibility. Kant does not present the three rationalistic pseudo-sciences as mere historical artifacts, but attempts to display them as inevitable products of human reason by associating them with the unconditioned use of the three traditional forms of syllogism: categorical, hypotheti­ cal, and disjunctive. Seeking the unconditioned subject to which all our thoughts relate as predicates, we generate the idea of the soul as a sim­ ple, non-empirical substance; seeking the unconditioned in respect of any of several hypothetical series arising in the world (of composition or extension, of decomposition or division, of cause and effect) leads to ideas such as that of a first event in time, an outer limit to space, a sim­ ple substance and a first cause. Finally, Kant derives the idea of a most real being or God as the ideal ground of the real properties constitut­ ing all other things. Kant's overall argument is that although these ra­ tionalist doctrines are inevitable illusions they are still pseudo-sciences, and must give way to doctrines remaining within the limits of sensibil­ ity: rational psychology gives way to empirical psychology, which Kant expounded in his lectures in the form of "anthropology"; rational cos­ mology gives way to the metaphysical foundations of natural science, which Kant derives by adding the sole empirical concept of motion to the principles of judgment; and rational theology gives way to what Kant will call moral theology, the doctrine that God and immortality are postulated, along with freedom of the will, solely as conditions of the possibility of human morality.
 
 The opening book of the "Transcendental Dialectic" is therefore a 14 Introduction derivation and even a limited defense of the transcendental ideas, such as the immortal soul, free will, and God, with which dogmatic meta­ physics has always been preoccupied (Az93-338/B 349-96).
