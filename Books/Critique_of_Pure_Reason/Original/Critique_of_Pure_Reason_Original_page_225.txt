Pt. II. Div. I. Bk I. Ch. I the synthetic unity of the manifold in intuition in general, on account of which they are called pure concepts of the understanding that pertain to objects a priori; this can never be accomplished by universal logic.
 
 a In such a way there arise exactly as many pure concepts of the un­ derstanding, which apply to objects of intuition in general priori, as a there were logical functions of all possible judgments in the previous table: for the understanding is completely exhausted and its capacityb entirely measured by these functions.c Following Aristotle we will call A80 these concepts categories, for our aim is basically identical with his al­ though very distant from it in execution.d B 106 Table of CategoriesIZ I.

Categor­ ies are concepts, through which certain intuitions are determined in regard to tbe syn­ thetic unity of tbeir consciousness as contained under tbese functions; e.g., what must be tbought as subject and not as predicate."
