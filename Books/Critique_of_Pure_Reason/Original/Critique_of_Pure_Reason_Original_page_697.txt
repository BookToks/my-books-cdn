Ch. II. Sec. III in perfect agreement with the moral principles of reason.a And thus, in the end, only pure reason, although only in its practical use, always has the merit of connecting with our highest interest a cognition that mere speculation can only imagine but never make valid, and of thereby mak­ ing it into not a demonstrated dogma but yet an absolutely necessary presupposition for reason's most essential ends.
 
 But now when practical reason has attained this high point, namely the concept of a single original being as the highest good, it must not undertake to start out from this concept and derive the moral laws themselves from it, as if it had elevated itself above all empirical condi­ tions of its application and soared up to an immediate acquaintance with new objects. For it was these laws alone whose inner practical necessity led us to the presupposition of a self-sufficient cause or a wise world­ regent, in order to give effectb to these laws, and hence we cannot in turn regard these as contingent and derived from a mere will, especially A819/B847 from a will of which we would have had no concept at all had we not formed it in accordance with those laws.33 So far as practical reason has the right to lead us, we will not hold actions to be obligatory because they are God's commands, but will rather regard them as divine com­ mands because we are internally obligated to them.34 We will study free­ dom under the purposive unity in accordance with principlesc of reason, and will believe ourselves to be in conformity with the divine will only insofar as we hold as holy the moral law that reason teaches us from the nature of actions themselves, believing ourselves to serve this divine will only through furthering what is best for the worldd in ourselves and oth­ ers. Moral theology is therefore only of immanent use, namely for ful­ filling our vocation here in the world by fitting into the system of all ends, not for fanatically or even impiously abandoning the guidance of a morally legislative reason in the good course of life in order to con­ nect it immediately to the idea of the highest being, which would pro­ vide a transcendental use but which even so, like the use of mere speculation, must pervert and frustrate the ultimate ends of reason.
