It emphasized appeals to healthy common sense over rigorous argument, and the popular dissemination of progres­ sive ideas with practical import over the investigation of metaphysical ques­ tions, toward which they often expressed contempt.
 
 6 The term "critique" or "criticism" (Kritik) was apparently first derived by Kant from Henry Home, Lord Kames (1696-1762), Elements of Criticism (1762), in which he referred to judgments in matters of beauty or taste (see 9: I 5)· Kant's first use of it is in an announcement of lectures for 1765-66 (see 2:311). As early as 1769, Kant defines "critique as a science not for bringing forth but for assessing certain things in accordance with rules of perfection; thus metaphysics is a science for assessing cognitions from pure re-ason" (R 4148, 17:434).

 12 In his letter to Schutz of 25 June 1787, Kant says he has in mind the demonstration in Euclid, Elements, bk. I, prop. 5 (10:466). Diogenes Laertius actually reports that Thales learned geometry from the Egyp­ tians, but also that he taught them to measure the height of the pyramids using the lengths of their shadows (Lives of Eminent Philosophers [London: Heinemann, 1924] 1.24,27).
 
 13 Galileo Galilei (1564-1647) described these experiments concerning ac­ celeration in his De Motu Accelerato and the "Third Day" of Dialogues on the Two World Systems (1632).
 
 14 Evangelista Torricelli (1608-I 647), a follower of Galileo, invented the baro­ meter, described here, in 1643. His findings were first published posthu­ mously in the edition of his academic lectures (1715).
 
 IS Georg Ernst Stahl (1660-1734) performed experiments with combustion and the smelting of metals which led to his formulation of the phlogiston theory in 1702. Antoine Lavoisier's discoveries, which eventually led to the replacement of the phlogiston theory, were first made in 1777, but were un­ available to Kant in 178 I. The phlogiston theory was still accepted by many chemists, such as Joseph Priestley, for many years afterward. Kant followed the revolution in chemistry very closely and in 1796 attended a replication of Lavoisier's crucial experiments by his colleague Carl Gottfried Hagen (as reported by A. F. Gehlen, Neues allgemeines Journal der Chemie 2 [1804], p. 240). Kant's acceptance of Lavoisier's oxidation theory is evident in the Opus postumum (22:508).
