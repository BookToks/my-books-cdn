179 Garve's original and altogether more sympathetic review, which had in the meantime been published in its original form, also raised the concern that Kant's theory of the positive use of only practical reason would "find acceptance in the heart and mind of only a few men" (Morrison, p. 193)' 180 B 14-19; cf. Prolegomena, 4:267-9.

He joined the justice ministry in 1755, and in 1770 (the same year Kant was appointed to his professorship at the University of Konigsberg) Zedlitz became Minister of Justice in charge of ecclesiastical and scholastic affairs. He held this post until 1788 (two years after Frederick's death). Because Zedlitz had the rep­ utation of being a religious freethinker, Frederick William II then replaced him with J. C. Wollner, with whose attempts to enforce religious orthodoxy among clergy and educators Kant soon came into conflict. As minister in charge of education, Zedlitz was important in establishing new schools throughout Prussia in the late eighteenth century. He was also author of Sur Ie patriotisme, considere comme oijet d'iducation dans les hats monarchiques (On patriotism considered as an object of education in monarchical states) (Ber­ lin, 1776). In 1778, Zedlitz offer,ed Kant a professorial chair at the Univer­ sity of Halle (letter of 28 Febru�ry 1778, ro: 224-5), which, however, he declined.

 ____ Prefaces I This preface was omitted in the second edition of 1787.
 
 2 Christian Wolff (1679-1754) was the central figure in the German Enlight­ enment. Wolff's most prominent follower, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714-1762), was author of Metaphysica (Halle, 1738; fourth edition, 1757; seventh edition, 1779), the text used most often in Kant's academic lectures (2:308-ro). Baumgarten's text is reprinted in the Akademie edition at 17:5-226.
 
 3 Notably, of course, David Hume (17II-I776), who had a considerable fol­ lowing in Germany.
 
 4 The avowed aim ofJohn Locke (1632-17°4) was to discover "the original, certainty and extent of human knowledge" by tracinz t4�enesis of all krlQ�edge to its. origin in experience (An Essay concerning Human Under­ standing [1690] book I, chapter I, § 2). Additional references to Locke as "physiologist of reason" may be found at R 4866 (1776-78, 18:2 I). See also R 4894 (1776-78, 18:21-2) for a related comment.
 
 5 This is a reference to popular Enlightenment philosophy, such as that of Johann August Eberhard (1739-18°9), J. G. Feder (1740-1821), Christian Garve (1742-1798), Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733-18II), and Moses 714 Notes to pages IOI-IIO Mendelssohn (1729-1786).
