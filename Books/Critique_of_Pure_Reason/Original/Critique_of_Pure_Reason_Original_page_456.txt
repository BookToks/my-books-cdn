On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> transcendental use, i.e., of no use at all. But in the minor premise the very same concept is applied to the object of all inner experience, yet without previously establishing it in concreto and grounding the condi­ tion of its application, namely its persistence; and hence here an empir­ ical, though unreliable, use is being made of it.
 
 In order, finally, to show the systematic connection of all these di­ alectical assertions in a sophisticala doctrine of the soul, in a connection of pure reason, and hence to show its completeness, one notes that ap­ perception is carried through by all classes of categories, but only to­ ward those concepts of the understanding which in each class ground the unity of the remaining ones in a possible perception, consequently, subsistence, reality, unity (not plurality), and existence; yet reason rep­ resents them all here as conditions of the possibility of a thinking being, which are themselves unconditioned. Thus in itself the soul cognizes: I.
 
 The unconditioned unity of relation,b l.e., itself, not as inhering but rather subsisting 2. 3.
 
 The unconditioned unity The unconditioned unity of quality in the multiplicity in time, i.e., i.e., not as a real whole not numerically different but rather simple* in different times, but rather as One and the very same subject 4.
 
 The unconditioned unity of existence in space l.e., nothing as the consciousness of several things outside itself, but rather only of the existence of itself, and of other things merely as its representations.
 
 * How the simple here once again corresponds to the category of reality, I now cannot yet show, but rather it will be proved in the following chapter, on the occasion of another use by reason of the very same concept.
