Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. III that I have to regard a being that contains all reality, hence all condi­ tions, as absolutely unconditioned, and consequently have found in it the concept of the thing which is suited for absolute necessity; then from this it still cannot be inferred that therefore the concept of a lim­ ited being, which does not have the highest reality, contradicts absolute necessity. For even if in its concept I do not find the unconditioned which the All of conditions already carries with it, still it cannot be con­ cluded just from this that its existence must be conditioned; just as I cannot say in a hypothetical syllogism: �ere a certain condition (here, namely, completeness according to concepts) is not, there too the con­ ditioned thing is not. Rather we are still at liberty to count all the re­ maining limited beings equally as absolutely necessary, even though we cannot infer their necessity from the universal concept we have of them.
 
 Looked at in this way, however, this argument has not produced for us even the least concept of the properties of a necessary being, and has in fact not achieved anything at all.
 
 Nevertheless there remains to this argument a certain importance and high regard of which it cannot straightway be divested simply on AS89/B617 account of this objective insufficiency. For suppose there were obliga­ tions that were entirely correct in the idea of reason but would have no real application to us, i.e., would be without any incentives, if a highest being were not presupposed who could give effect and emphasis to the practical laws; then we would also have an obligation to follow those concepts, that even though they may not be objectively sufficient, are still preponderant in accordance with the measure of our reason, and in comparison with which we recognize nothing better or more convinc­ ing. The duty to choose would here tip the indecisiveness of specula­ tion out of balance through a practical addition; indeed, reason, as the most circumspect judge, could not find any justification for itself if, under the pressure of urgent causes though with defec�ive insight, its judgment were not to follow these grounds, than which we at least know none better.
 
 This argument, although it is in fact transcendental, since it rests on the inner insufficiency of the contingent, is yet so simple and natural that it is suited to the commonest human understanding as soon as the latter is once led to it. One sees things alter, arise, and perish; therefore they, or at least their state, must have a cause. About every cause, howAS9 0 / B 6 I 8 ever, that may be given in experience, the same thing may once again be asked. Now where could we more appropriately locate the supreme causality than right where the highest causality is, i.e., in that being, originally containing within itself what is sufficient for the possible ef­ fect, whose concept also comes about very easily through the single trait of an all-encompassing perfection. This highest cause we then take to be absolutely necessary, because we find it absolutely necessary to as562 Section III.
