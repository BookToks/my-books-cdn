If that has never hap­ pened, and if it can never be expected to happen, owing to the unsuitability of the common human understanding for such subtle speculation; if rather the conviction that reaches the public, insofar as it rests on rational grounds, had to be effected by something else -namely, as regards the first point, on that remarkable predisposi­ tion of our nature, noticeable to every human being, never to be capa­ ble of being satisfied by what is temporal (since the temporal is always insufficient for the predispositions of our whole vocation) leading to the hope of a future life; in respect of the second point, the mere clear exBXXlXll position of our duties in opposition to all claims of the inclinations lead­ ing to the consciousness of freedom; and finally, touching on the third point, the splendid order, beauty, and providence shown forth every­ where in nature leading to the faith in a wise and great author of the world -then this possession not only remains undisturbed, but it even gains in respect through the fact that now the schools are instructed to pretend to no higher or more comprehensive insight on any point touching the universal human concerns than the insight that is accessi­ ble to the great multitude (who are always most worthy of our respect), and to limit themselves to the cultivation of those grounds of proof alone that can be grasped universally and are sufficient from a moral standpoint. The alteration thus concerns only the arrogant claims of the schools, which would gladly let themselves be taken for the sole ex­ perts and guardians of such truths (as they can rightly be taken in many other parts of knowledge), sharing with the public only the use of such truths, while keeping the key to them for themselves (quod mecum nescit, salus vult scire videri). a Yet care is taken for a more equitable claim on the Bxxxiv part of the speculative philosopher. He remains the exclusive trustee of a science that is useful to the public even without their knowledge, namely the critique of reason; for the latter can never become popular, but also has no need of being so; for just as little as the people want to fill their heads with fine-spun arguments for useful truths, so just as lit­ tle do the equally subtle objections against these truths ever enter their minds; on the contrary, because the school inevitably falls into both, as does everyone who raises himself to speculation, the critique of reason a "What he knows no more than I, he alone wants to seem to know." The correct quota­ tion is "Quod mecum ignorat, solus volt scire videl'i" (What is unknown to me, that alone he wants to seem to know) (Horace, Epistles 2.1.87).
 
 118 to the second edition <B> is bound once and for all to prevent, by a fundamental investigation of the rights of speculative reason, the scandal that sooner or later has to be noticed even among the people in the disputes in which, in the absence of criticism, metaphysicians (and among these in the end even clerics) inevitably involve themselves, and in which they afterwards even falsify their own doctrines.
