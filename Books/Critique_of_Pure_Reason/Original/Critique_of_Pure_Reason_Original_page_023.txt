This is Kant's task in Book II of the "Transcendental Analytic," the "Analytic of Principles." This book is in turn divided into three chapters, "The Schematism of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding," the "System of All Principles of Pure Understanding," and "On the Ground of the Distinction of All Objects in General into Phenomena and Noumena." In the first of these chapters Kant shows how the logical content of the categories derived from the metaphysical deduction is to be trans­ formed into a content applicable to the data of our senses; in the sec­ ond, he demonstrates principles of judgment showing that all of the categories must be applied to our experience by means of arguments that are sometimes held to prove the objective validity of the categories independently of the prior transcendental deduction; and in the third chapter Kant draws out the consequences of the preceding two, argu­ ing that because the categories have a determinate use only when ap­ plied to spatiotemporal data and yet the forms of space and time themselves are transcendentally ideal, the categories also have a deter­ minate cognitive use only when applied to appearances ("phenomena"), and therefore that by means of the categories things as they are in themselves ("noumena") might be thought but not known.
 
 In the "Schematism," Kant argues that the categories, whose content has thus far been derived solely from the logical structure of judgments, must be made applicable to objects whose form has thus far been spec­ ified solely by the pure forms of space and time. He argues that this can be done by associating each category with a "transcendental schema," a form or relation in intuition that is an appropriate representation of a logical form or relation. In particular, Kant argues that each category must be associated with a temporal schema, since time is the form of every sensible intuition whatever, while space is the form of outer intu­ itions only. For example, the schema of the logical conception of ground and consequence is the concept of causality as rule-governed temporal succession: the concept of a cause, as opposed to that of a mere ground, is the concept of "the real upon which, whenever it is posited, something else always follows," or "the succession of the manifold insofar as it is subject to a rule" ( A 144/B 183). As Kant will make clearer in the second edition, however, the subsequent chapter on the "Principles" will show that although the content of the transcendental schemata for the cate­ gories may be explicated in purely temporal terms, the use of these schemata in turn depends upon judgments about the spatial properties and relations of at least some objects of empirical judgment. Thus the argument of the "Analytic of Principles" as a whole is that the categories both must and can only be used to yield knowledge of objects in space and time. The principles expressing the universal and necessary appli­ cation of the categories to objects given in space and time are precisely 10 Introduction the synthetic a priori judgments that are to be demonstrated by Kant's critical replacement for traditional metaphysics.
