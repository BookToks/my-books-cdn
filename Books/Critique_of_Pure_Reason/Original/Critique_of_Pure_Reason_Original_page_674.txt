Transcendental hypotheses of the speculative use of reason and a freedom to make good the lack of physical grounds of explanation by using all sorts of hyperp hysical ones can never be permitted at all, partly because reason is not advanced by them but rather cut off from all progress in their use, and partly because this license must ultimately de­ stroy all fruits of the cultivation of its own proper soil, namely ex­ perience. For whenever the explanation of nature becomes difficult, we always have at hand a transcendental ground of explanation that spares us that inquiry, and our research is concluded not through insight but A 774/ B 802 through the total incomprehensibility of a principleb which was thought up so far in advance that it must have contained the concept of that which is absolutely first.
 
 The second point which is requisite to make an hypothesis worthy of being assumed is its adequacy for determining a priori the consequences these are given. If for this purpose auxiliary hypotheses need to be called in, they arouse the suspicion of being a mere invention, since each of them requires the same justification which the underlying thought needed, and hence can give no reliable testimony. If on the pre­ supposition of an unlimitedly perfect cause there is no lack of grounds of explanation for all the purposiveness, order, and greatnessc that is found in the world, then the deviations from these and the evils that re­ veal themselves, at least according to our concepts, require still further hypotheses in order to save the first from these objections. If the sim­ ple self-sufficiency of the human soul, which has been laid at the ground of its appearances, is impugned by difficulties because these are phe­ nomena similar to the alterations of matter (growth and decay), then new hypotheses must be called in to help, which are not without plau­ sibility but are still without any confirmation, except that which is given to them by the opinion assumed as the primary ground, which they were supposed to explain.
 
 If the assertions of reason that have here been adduced as examples (incorporeal unity of the soul and existence of a highest being) are not to count as hypotheses, but as dogmata proven a priori, then they are not even an issue. In that case, however, one would indeed take care that the proof have the apodictic certainty of a demonstration. For to make the actuality of such ideas merely probable is an absurd proposal, just a Weltobjecte b Princips , Grofe 661 Doctrine of Method.
