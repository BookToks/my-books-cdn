 13 A large number of reflections bear on the argument of this paragraph. See R 4077-8 (1769,17:4°5-6), R 4191 (1769-70, IT451), R 4673 (1773-75, Q536-42), R 4674 (1773-75, Q643-7, especially p. 645), R 5329 (1776-78, 18:153),R 5552 (1778-79? 1780s?,1 8:218-20, especially p. 220), R 5637 (1780s, 18:271-6, especially pp. 271-2), R 5876 (1783-84, 18:374-5), and, even as late as 1797, R 6342 (18:667), R 6346 (18:670-1), R 6348 (18:671-2), R 6349 (18:672-5), R 6350 (18:676-7), R 6351 (18:677-8), and 6352 (18:678-9). Kant's interest in this long-settled matter may have been revived at this late date by an essay competition of the Royal Academy of Sciences intended to call forth defenses of the anti-Kantian po­ sition that all knowledge is of empirical origin; see R 635I.
 
 14 Kant describes this as hypothetical correctness at R 4976 (1776-78, 18:46-7).

 20 Kant refers here to objections that had been brought against his inaugural dissertation by two of the most important philosophers of the period, Johann Heinrich Lambert and Moses Mendelssohn, as well as by the then well-known aesthetician and member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, Johann Georg Sulzer. Lambert objected that even though Kant was correct to maintain that "Time is indisputably a conditio sine qua non" of all of our representations of objects, it does not follow from this that time is unreal, for "If alterations are real then time is also real, whatever it might be" (letter 61 to Kant, of 18 October 1770,10:103-11, at 106-7). Mendelssohn also wrote that he could not convince himself that time is "something merely subjective," for "Succession is at least a necessary condition of the repre­ sentations of finite spirits. Now finite spirits are not only subjects, but also objects of representations, those of both God and their fellow spirits.
 
 Hence the sequence [of representations] on one another is also to be re­ garded as something objective" (letter 63 to Kant, of 25 December 1770, 10:113-16, at 1I5). (The objection that time cannot be denied to be real just because it is a necessary property of our representations, since our rep­ resentations themselves are real, has continued to be pressed against Kant; see, for instance, P. F. Strawson, The Bounds of Sense [London: Methuen, 1966], pp. 39 and 54.) Sulzer took an only slightly more conciliatory line: he insisted that "Duration and extension are absolutely simple concepts, which cannot be explained, although they have in my opinion a true real­ ity," even though he was prepared to concede that "Time and space, how­ ever, are composite concepts," which may thus be regarded as subjective although grounded in an objectively valid experience of duration and ex­ tension (letter 62 to Kant, of 8 December 1770, 10:110-12, at I I I). Sulzer 721 Notes to pages 166-176 describes himself as having been an adherent of Leibniz's view of time and space, but his view that time is a composite concept grounded on the sim­ ple concept of duration is also reminiscent of Locke's treatment of the idea of time as a complex idea (specifically, a simple mode) formed from the ex­ perience of duration (Essay concerning Human Understanding, book II, chap­ ter XIV).
