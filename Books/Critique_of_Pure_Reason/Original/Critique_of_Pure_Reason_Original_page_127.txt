But then metaphysics also has the rare good fortune, enjoyed by no other rational science that has to do with objectsO (for logic deals only with the form of thinking in general), which is that if by this critique it has been brought onto the secure course of a science, then it can fully embrace the entire field of cognitions belonging to it Bxxiv and thus can complete its work and lay it down for posterity as a princi­ pal frameworkb that can never be enlarged, since it has to do solely with principlesc and the limitations on their use, which are determined by the principles themselves. Hence as a fundamental science, metaphysics is also bound to achieve this completeness, and we must be able to say of it: nil actum reputans, si quid superesset agendum. d But it will be asked: What sort of treasure is it that we intend to leave to posterity, in the form of a metaphysics that has been purified through criticism but thereby also brought into a changeless state?e On a cursory overview of this work, one might believe that one perceives it to be only of negative utility, teaching us never to venture with speculative reason beyond the boundaries of experience; and in fact that is its first useful­ ness. But this utility soon becomes positive when we become aware that the principles with which speculative reason ventures beyond its boundaries do not in fact result in extending our use of reason, but rather, if one considers them more closely, inevitably result in narrow­ ing it by threatening to extend the boundaries of sensibility, to which BXXV these principles really belong, beyond everything, and so even to dis­ lodge the use of pure (practical) reason. Hence a critique that limits the speculative use of reason is, to be sure, to that extent negative, but be­ cause it simultaneously removes an obstacle that limits or even threat­ ens to wipe out the practical use of reason, this critique is also in fact of positive and very important utility, as soon as we have convinced our­ selves that there is an absolutely necessary practical use of pure reason (the moral use), in which reason unavoidably extends itself beyond the boundaries of sensibility, without needing any assistance from specula­ tive reason, but in which it must also be made secure against any coun­ teraction from the latter, in order not to fall into contradiction with a Objecte Hauptstuhl; Kant's metaphor seems to be drawn from weaving (cf. Webstuhl, a loom or b frame for weaving).
 
 Principien C "Thinking nothing done if something more is to be done." The correct quotation is: d "Caesar in omnia praeceps, nil actum credens, cum quid superesset agendum, instat atrox" (Caesar, headlong in everything, believing nothing done while something more re­ mained to be done, pressed forward fiercely) (Lucan, De bello civili 2:657).
