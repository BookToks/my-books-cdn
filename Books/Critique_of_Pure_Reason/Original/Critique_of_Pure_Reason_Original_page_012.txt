Acknowledgments This translation of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is the work of both of us over many years, during which we have had the helpful input of many students, friends, and colleagues. Those who have been especially generous of their time and effort are owed special thanks. Those who helped us in one way or another in the preparation and revision of the translation are Gunter Zoller, Charles Parsons, Stephan Wagner, the students in Paul Guyer's Kant classes at the University of Pennsylvania in I994-95, and the students in Allen Wood's "German Philosophical Texts" classes at Cornell University in 1990 and 1992. Jens Timmer­ man made available to us detailed corrections of the Raymund Schmidt (Meiner) edition of the German text, and Georg Mohr provided us with corrections of the Ingeborg Heidemann (Reclam) edition. Several peo­ ple, including Lewis White Beck, Rolf George and Martin Weatherston, offered us corrections of earlier English translations. John Cooper and Rega Wood helped us with the identification and attribution of classi­ cal quotations. The trustees of the Florence R. C. Murray Trust en­ dowed the research fund that paid for facsimiles of the original editions of the Critique and other research materials. Finally, special thanks to Allison Crapo and Cynthia Schossberger for their generous and metic­ ulous help with the proofreading.
