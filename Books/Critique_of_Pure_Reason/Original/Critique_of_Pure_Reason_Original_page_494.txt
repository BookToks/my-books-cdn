The antithetic of pure reason mathematics, I will remark only that when philosophy quibbles with mathematics, this happens only because it forgets that this question has A44I/B469 to do only with appearances and their conditions. Here, however, it is not enough to find the concept of the simple for the pure concept of the understanding of the composite, but one must find the intuition of the simple for the intuition of the composite (for matter), and this is entirely impossible in accordance with the laws of sensibility, hence impossible with objects of sense. Thus for a whole made up of substances thought through the pure understanding it might very well hold that prior to all composition of such substances we must have a simple; but this does not hold for a totum substantiale phaenomenon,a which, as empirical intuition in space, carries with it the necessary property that no part of it is simple, because no part of space is simple. Meanwhile, the monadists are subtle enough to try to escape from this difficulty by not presupposing space as a condition of the possibility of objects of outer intuition (bodies), but rather presupposing these objects and the dynamical relation of substances in general as the condition of the possibility of space. Now we have a concept of bodies only as appearances, but as such they necessarily presuppose space as the condition of the possibility of all external appearance; and so this dodge is futile, just as it has also been sufficiently blocked above in the Transcendental Aesthetic. If they were things in themselves, then the proof of the monadists would of course hold.
 
 The second dialectical assertion has the peculiarity that it has against A443/ B47I it a dogmatic assertion that is the only one of all the sophisticalb assertions that undertakes to provide visible proof, in an object of experience, of the reality of something we have ascribed above merely to transcendental ideas, namely the simplicityc of substance: namely, that the object of inner sense, the I that thinks, is an absolutely simple substance. Without going into this (since it was considered more completely above), I will remark only that if something is merely thought as an object, without adding any synthetic determination of its intuition (as happens in the completely bare representation "I"), then of course nothing manifold and no composition can be perceived in such a representation. Since, further, the predicates through which I think this object are mere intuitions of inner sense, nothing can occur in them that could prove a manifold of elements external to one another, and hence real composition. Thus self-consciousness is such that because the subject that thinks is simultaneously its own object,d it cannot divide a substantial phenomenal whole verniinftelnden b , Simplicitiit Object d 481
