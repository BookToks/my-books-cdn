The "Doctrine of Elements" in turn is divided into two main (al­ though very disproportionately sized) parts, the "Transcendental Aesthetic" and the "Transcendental Logic," the first of which considers the a priori contributions of the fundamental forms of our sensibility, namely space and time, to our knowledge, and the second of which con­ siders the a priori contributions of the intellect, both genuine and spu­ rious, to our knowledge. This division is derived from Baumgarten's introduction of "aesthetics" as the title for the science of "lower" or "sensitive cognition" in contrast to logic as the science ofhigher or con­ ceptual cognition;7 at the time of writing the Critique, however, Kant rejected Baumgarten's supposition that there could be a science of taste (what we now call "aesthetics"), and instead appropriated the term for his theory of the contribution of the forms of sensibility to knowledge in general.s After a brief explanation of the distinction between "gen­ erallogic" and "transcendental logic" -the former being the basic sci­ ence of the forms of thought regardless of its object and the latter being the science of the basic forms for the thought of objects (A 50-57/ B 74-82) -Kant then splits the "Transcendental Logic" into two main divisions, the "Transcendental Analytic" and the "Transcendental Dialectic." Kant uses this distinction, which derives from a sixteenth­ century Aristotelian distinction between the logic of truth and the logic of probability, represented in eighteenth-century Germany by the Jena professor Joachim Georg Darjes (1714-1792),9 to distinguish between the positive contributions of the understanding, working in cooperation with sensibility, to the conditions of the possibility of experience and knowledge (the "Transcendental Analytic") and the spurious attempt of reason working independently of sensibility to provide metaphysical in­ sight into things as they are in themselves (the "Transcendental Dialectic"). The "Transcendental Analytic" is in turn divided into two books, the "Analytic of Concepts" and the "Analytic of Principles," the first of which argues for the ulllversal and necessary validity of the pure concepts of the understanding, or the categories, such as the concepts of substance and causation, and the second of which argues for the valid­ ity of fundamental principles of empirical judgment employing those categories, such as the principles of the conservation of substance and the universality of causation.
 
 The "Transcendental Dialectic" is also divided into two books, "On 4 Introduction the Concepts of Pure Reason" and "On the Dialectical Inferences of Pure Reason," in which Kant explains how pure reason generates ideas of metaphysical entities such as the soul, the world as a whole, and God and then attempts to prove the reality of those ideas by extending pat­ terns of inference which are valid within the limits of human sensibility beyond those limits.
