If after many preliminaries and prepa­ rations are made, a science gets stuck as soon as it approaches its end, or if in order to reach this end it must often go back and set out on a new path; or likewise if it proves impossible for the different co-work­ ers to achieve unanimity as to the way in which they should pursueh their common aim; then we may be sure that such a study is merely groping about, that it is still far from having entered upon the secure course of a science; and it is already a service to reason if we can possi­ bly find that path for it, even if we have to give up as futile much of what was included in the end previously formed without deliberation.
 
 Bviii That from the earliest times logic has traveled this secure course can be seen from the fact that since the time of Aristotle it has not had to go a single step backwards, unless we count the abolition of a few dis­ pensable subtleties or the more distinct determination of its presenta­ tion, which improvements belong more to the elegance than to the security of that science. What is further remarkable about logic is that until now it has also been unable to take a single step forward, and therefore seems to all appearance to be finished and complete. For if some moderns have thought to enlarge it by interpolating psychologi­ cal chapters about our different cognitive powers (about imagination, wit), or metaphysical chapters about the origin of cognition or the dif­ ferent kinds of certainty in accordance with the diversity of objects' (about idealism, skepticism, etc.), or anthropological chapters about our prejudice (about their causes and remedies), then this proceeds only from their ignorance of the peculiar nature of this science. It is not an improvement but a deformation of the sciences when their boundaries are allowed to run over into one another; the boundaries oflogic, how­ ever, are determined quite precisely by the fact that logic is the science B ix that exhaustively presents and strictly proves nothing but the formal a This new preface, so entitled, replaces the preface from the first edition.
