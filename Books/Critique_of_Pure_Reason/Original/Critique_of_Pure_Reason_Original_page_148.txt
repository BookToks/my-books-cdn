, which are all of empirical origin, must there be presup­ posed.n Hence transcendental philosophy is a philosophyb of pure, merely speculative reason. For everything practical, insofar as it contains motives,c is related to feelings, which belong among empirical sources of cognition.
 
 Now if one wants to set up the division of this science from the gen­ eral viewpoint of a system in general, then the one that we will now pre­ sent must contain first a Doctrine of Elements and second a Doctrine of Method of pure reason. Each of these main parts will have its sub­ division, the grounds for which cannot yet be expounded here. All that seems necessary for an introduction or a preliminary is that there are two stems of human cognition, which may perhaps arise from a com­ mon but to us unknown root, namely sensibility and understanding, through the first of which objects are given to us, but through the sec­ ond of which they are thought. Now if sensibility were to contain a priori representations, which constitute the conditions under which ob- B 30 jects are given to us, it would belong to transcendental philosophy. The transcendental doctrine of the senses will have to belong to the first part A 16 of the science of elements, since the conditions under which alone the objects of human cognition are given precede those under which those objects are thought.
 
 n This sentence is revised in the second edition to reflect Kant's intervening argument, beginning with the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals of 1785, that the principle of morality if not its application is indeed entirely priori. See 28-9 below.
