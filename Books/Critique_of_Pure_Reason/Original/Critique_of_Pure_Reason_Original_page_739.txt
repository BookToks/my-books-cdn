Two published documents from the intervening period are Prolegomena to any future Meta­ physics (1783), §§ 16-22, in which the argument turns on a distinction be­ tween mere judgments of perception and judgments of experience, with the latter but not the former being held to have a priori concepts of the under­ standing as necessary conditions; and the long footnote in the preface to the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786) (4:474-6n.), in which Kant suggests by contrast that the deduction could be grounded entirely on the "precisely determined definition of a judgment in general" C4:475n.). It is notable that there is no reference to the unity of apperception or self­ consciousness in either of these attempted deductions. Other important documents on the development of the deduction, many of which date from the period 1783-84, would thus seem to postdate the composition of the Prolegomena, which Kant seems to have finished in the summer of 1782, and would thus be either afterthoughts on the Prolegomena or notes toward the next edition of the Critique. Several notes including extensive sketches of a deduction which may or may not postdate the first edition of the Critique include: R 5637, which may be from 1780-81 or later (18:271-6); R 5642, which is univocally assigned to 1780-81 (18:279-82); and R 5643, which may be from anywhere between 1780 and 1788 (18:282-4). Those univocally assigned to the period 1783-84 include: R 5923 (18:385-7), R 5926 (18:388), R 5927 (18:388-9), and R 5930-4 (18:390-3).
 
 33 Although he presumably presents here only an outline of the strategy for the ensuing deduction, in a later manuscript Kant suggested that the in­ ference that any combination requires an a priori concept is virtually the whole of the deduction. See the manuscripts, written in 1793 or later, en­ titled What Real Progress Has Metaphysics Made in Germany since the Time of Leibniz and Wolff? (20:271, 275-6; in the translation by Ted Humphrey [New York: Abaris Books, 1983], pp. 75, 83-5)· 34 To this note compare especially R 5930 (1783-84, 18:390).
 
 35 To this paragraph compare also the loose sheet B 12 (23:18-20, especially P·19)· 36 The singularity or unity of space and time play no role in the argument of § 25, but do playa crucial role in that of § 26. Kant's reference to § 25 here should therefore presumably be replaced by a reference to § 26.
 
 37 This is the key premise in a number of Kant's sketches of the deduction from 1783-84, including R 5927 (r8:388-9) and R 5932 (18:391-2), as well as R 5643, assigned to the broader period 1780-88 (18:282-4). From the same period, see also Metaphysik Volckmann, 28:405-6. For Kant's later thought on the concept of an object, see R 6350 (1797, 18:675-7)' 38 To the argument of this and the following section, compare especially R 5923 (18:385-7).
 
 726 Notes to pages 251-265 39 Kant is here summing up the argument of his 1762 essay Die folsche Spitz­ findigkeit der vier sytlogistischen Figuren; translated as "The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures" in David Walford, ed.
