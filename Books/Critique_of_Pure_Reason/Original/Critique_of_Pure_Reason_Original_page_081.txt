"'70 Finally, Kant rejected any comparison of his view to Berkeley's on the ground that Berkeley's empiricism leaves all knowledge of space and time a posteriori and contingent, whereas only Kant's own formal idealism can explain our a priori knowledge of space and time as the uni­ versal and necessary forms of intuition.
 
 I7I Emphasizing that only his transcendental idealism can explain our a priori knowledge of mathematics and pure physics while at the same time demonstrating that as formal idealism it is entirely compatible with the real existence of external objects would both be major objec­ tives in Kant's revisions of the Critique for its second edition. Vindi­ cating his view that the illusory theoretical use of pure reason must be replaced by its sound practical use, the last point challenged by the Gottingen review although not replied to in the Prolegomena, would also be an aim of those revisions. But, as had been the case before with the critical response to the inaugural dissertation, Kant also revealed in the Prolegomena a concern that his critic had not raised: namely, a con­ cern about the adequacy of the transcendental deduction of the cate­ gories itself. Kant expressed this worry about the deduction (and the associated paralogisms) as mildly as he could: he says that he is com­ pletely satisfied with the "content, order, and doctrine" of his work but that he is "not entirely satisfied with the presentation in some parts of the Doctrine of Elements, e.g., the deduction of the categories or the paralogisms of pure reason."I72 In fact, both of those chapters would be completely rewritten in the second edition of the Critique, in part to re­ spond to the challenge to Kant's variety of idealism raised by the Gottingen review but also to respond to Kant's own concerns about their persuasiveness.
 
 Indeed, Kant had already begun to manifest his concern about the adequacy of the deduction in the Prolegomena itself. Following what he claims to be the "analytic" method of the Prolegomena rather than the "synthetic" method of the Critiquel73 the difference is supposed to be between a method that analyzes the presuppositions of undisputed knowledge-claims and one that determines the consequences of funda­ mental claims about the human cognitive faculties,174 but in fact the major difference between Kant's argument in the two works concerns which knowledge-claims it is whose conditions are analyzed -Kant replaces the transcendental deduction of the categories, which purports to analyze the necessary conditions of the possibility of the transcen68 Introduction dental unity of apperception, with an analysis of the necessary condition of universally and necessarily valid judgments in ordinary life and sci­ ence that makes no use of the concept of apperception at all.
