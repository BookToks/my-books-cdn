The extensive outline of the "Dialectic" at R 5553 (1778-79? 1780-81? 22 1-9), however, shows that by two years later Kant had formulated the idea of a tripartite dialec­ tic with a separate "Ideal of Pure Reason" (p. 223), thereby leading to the reincorporation into the Critique of the 1763 criticisms of the ontological and physico-theological arguments. In addition to the many particular re­ flections, especially on the ontological argument, that will be mentioned below, the reader interested in Kant's critique of rational theology should also consult the extensive set of notes on Johann August Eberhard's Vorbereitung zur natiirlichen Theologie, preserved as R 6206-3IO (1783-88, 18:489-606), and the Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion, tr. A.

 86 It was not Plato's doctrine that the ideas are the thoughts of God, but this doctrine did originate in syncretistic Platonism from the period of the Middle Academy, through the combination of Platonism with Stoicism in such thinkers as Albinus (second century B.C.). The theory of divine ideas was later adopted by Platonists as diverse as Philo of Alexandria, Plotinus, and St. Augustine, and became fundamental to later Christian interpreta­ tions of Platonism.

 87 A large number of reflections bear on the argument of this section. Exposi­ tions of the argument that thoroughgoing determination of the concept of any individual requires a thoroughly determinate ens realissimum, offered largely without criticism, can be found at R 4244-9 (1769-70, 17=477-81), R4253 (1769-70, 17:482-3), R4255 (1769-70, 17=484) R4262 (1769-7°?
 
 ' 1772-76? 17:486-7), R 4255 (1772-75, 17:695-6), R 4569-70 (1772-75, 17=597-8), R 4729 (1773-75, 17:619-20), R 5270-74 (1776-78, 18:13840), R 5500 (1776-78, 18:199-200), R 5502-5 (1776-78, 18:200-2) and R 5522 (1776-78, 18:207-8). Criticisms of the argument turn up only in reflections subsequent to the first publication of the Critique: see R 624856 (1785-88, 18:530-3), R 6290 (1783-84, 18:558-9), R 6293 (1783-84, 18:561-2) and R 6298 (1783-84, 18:565).
 
 88 Following Leibniz, the Wolffians held that each individual thing is indi­ viduated through its complete concept, which is determined by one and only one of every possible pair of contradictorily opposed predicates. Thus they distinguish a universal concept (which applies in principle to indefi­ nitely many individual things) frbm an individual concept (which indi­ viduates an individual thing) through the fact that the former is undetermined with respect to some pairs of contradictorily opposed pred­ icates, whereas the latter is subject to what Baumgarten calls the "princi­ ple of thoroughgoing determination" (principium omnimodae determinatio) (Metaphysica § 148).
