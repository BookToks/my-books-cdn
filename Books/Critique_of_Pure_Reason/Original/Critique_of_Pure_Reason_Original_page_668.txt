Outside this sphere (field of experience) nothing is an object" for it; indeed even questions about such supposed objects con­ cern only subjective principlesb of a thoroughgoing determination of the relationsc that can obtain among the concepts of understanding in­ side of this sphere.
 
 We are really in possession of synthetic a priori cognition, as is estab­ lished by the principles of understanding, which anticipate experience.
 
 Now if someone cannot even make the possibility of these comprehen­ sible to himself, he may certainly begin to doubt whether they are really present in us a priori; but he cannot declare this to be an impossibility through the mere power of the understanding, and declare to be nuga­ tory all of the steps that reason takes in accordance with their guidance.
 
 He can only say: If we had insight into their origin and authenticity, then we would be able to determine the domain and the boundaries of our reason; but until this has happened, all assertions of the latter are A 763 / B 79I shots in the dark. And in such a way a thoroughgoing doubt of all dogmatic philosophy that goes its way without any critique of reason itself would be entirely well founded; yet reason cannot on that account be entirely denied such a progress, if it is prepared and secured through better groundwork.d For one thing, all the concepts, indeed all the questions that pure reason lays before us, lie not in experience but themselves in turn only in reason, and they must therefore be able to be solved and their validity or nullity must be able to be comprehended.
 
 We are, also, not justified in repudiating these problems under the excuse of our incapacity, as if their solution really lay in the nature of things, and in rejecting further investigation, since reason has given birth to these ideas from its own womb alone, and is therefore liable to give account of either their validity or their dialectical illusion.
 
 All skeptical polemicizing is properly directed only against the dog­ matist, who continues gravely along his path without any mistrust of his original objective principles,' i.e., without critique, in order to unhinge his concept! and bring him to self-knowledge.g In itself it settles noth­ ing at all about what we can know and what by contrast we cannot a Object b Principien , Verhdltnisse d Grundlegung , Principien f Concept g Selbsterkenntnis 655 Doctrine of Method.
