Ch. 1. Sec. IV Every transcendental proposition, however, proceeds solely from one concept, and states the synthetic condition of the possibility of the ob­ ject in accordance with this concept. The ground of proof can therefore only be unique, since outside this concept there is nothing further by A788/B816 means of which the object could be determined, and the proof can therefore contain nothing more than the determination of an object in general in accordance with this concept, which is also unique. In the transcendental analytic we drew, e.g., the principle "Everything that happens has a cause" from the unique condition of the objective possi­ bility of a concept of that which happens in general, namely that the determination of an occurrence in time, and consequently this (occur­ rence) as belonging to experience, would be impossible if it did not stand under such a dynamical rule. Now this is also the only possible ground of proof; for only through the fact that an object is determined for the concept by means of the law of causality does the represented occurrence have objective validity, i.e., truth. To be sure, still other proofs of this principle, e.g., from contingency, have been attempted;23 but if this is considered clearly, one cannot discover any characteristic of contingency except that of happening, i.e., existence which is pre­ ceded by a not-being of the object, and one therefore always comes back to the same ground of proof. If the proposition "Everything that thinks is simple" is to be proved, one does not dwell on the manifold­ ness of thinking, but sticks solely with the concept of the I, which is simple and to which all thinking is related. It is just the same with the transcendental proof of the existence of God, which depends solely on A 7891 B 8 I 7 the reciprocality of the concepts of the most real being and the neces­ sary being, and cannot be sought anywhere else.
 
 Through this cautionary remark the critique of the assertions of rea­ son is very much reduced. �ere reason would conduct its business through mere concepts, only a single proof is possible if any proof is possible at all. Thus if one sees the dogmatist step forth with ten proofs, one can be sure that he has none at all. For if he had one that proved apodictically (as must be the case in matters of pure reason), for what would he need the rest? His intention is only that of every parliamen­ tary advocate: one argument for this one, another one for that, in order to take advantage of the weakness of his judges who, without getting into the business deeply and in order to get rid of it quickly, just grasp at the first argument that occurs to them and decide accordingly.
 
 The third special rule of pure reason, if it is subjected to a discipline in regard to transcendental proofs, is that its proofs must never be ap­ agogic but always ostensive. The direct or ostensive proof is, in all kinds of cognition, that which is combined with the conviction of truth and simultaneously with insight into its sources; the apagogic proof, on the contrary, can produce certainty, to be sure, but never comprehensi668 The discipline of pure reason in proofs bility of the truth in regard to its connection with the grounds of its possibility.
