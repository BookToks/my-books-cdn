Critique of all speculative theology which, as the standpoint of an observer, has its horizon, i.e., a multi­ plicity of things that can be represented and surveyed, as it were, from it. Within this horizon a multiplicity of points must be able to be given to infinity, each of which in turn has its narrower field of view; i.e., every species contains subspecies in accordance with the principle a of specification, and the logical horizon consists only of smaller horizons (subspecies), but not of points that have no domain (individuals). But different horizons, i.e., genera, which are determined from just as many concepts, one can think as drawn out into a common horizon, A6S9/ B 687 which one can survey collectively from its middle point, which is the higher genus, until finally the highest genus is the universal and true horizon, determined from the standpoint of the highest concept and comprehending all manifoldness, as genera, species, and subspecies, under itself.
 
 The law of homogeneity leads me to this highest standpoint, while the law of specification leads to all the lower ones and their greatest possible variety. Since, however, in such a way nothing in the entire do­ main of all possible concepts is empty, and outside it nothing can be en­ countered, there arises from the presupposition of that universal field of view and its thoroughgoing division the principle: non datur vacuum for­ marum,b i.e., there are no different original and primary genera, which would be, as it were, isolated and separated from one another (by an empty intervening space), but rather all the manifold genera are only partitioningsC of a single supreme and universal genus; and from this principle its immediate consequence: datur continuum formarum,d i.e., all varieties of species bound one another and permit no transition to one another by a leap, but only through every smaller degree of distinction, so that from each one can reach another; in a word, there are no species or subspecies that are proximate (in the concept of reason), but inter­ vening species are always possible, whose difference from the first and second species is smaller than their difference from each other. A66o/ B 688 The first law, therefore, guards against excess in the manifold variety of original genera, and recommends sameness of kind; the second, on the contrary, limits in turn this inclination to unanimity, and demands that one distinguish subspecies before one turns to the individuals with one's universal concepts. The third law unites the first two, prescribing even in the case of the highest manifoldness a sameness of kind through the graduated transition from one species to others, which shows a e a Princip b There is no vacuum of forms.
