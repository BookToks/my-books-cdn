How足 ever, they do not have cause for this, and it is sufficient to declare to them: non defensoribus istis tempus eget. b Each must conduct his affair by means of a legitimate proof through the transcendental deduction of its grounds of proof, i.e., directly, so that one can see what his claim of reason has to say for itself. For if his opponent stands on subjective grounds, it is of course easy to refute him, but without any advantage to the dogmatist, who commonly depends in just the same way on subjec足 tive causes of judgment and who can in the same way be driven into a corner by his opponent. But if both sides would only proceed directly, then either they themselves must notice the difficulty, indeed the im足 possibility of discovering a title for their assertions, and will in the end be able to appeal only to their antiquity, or else the critique will easily reveal the dogmatic illusion, and compel pure reason to surrender its exaggerated pretensions in its speculative use, and to draw back within the boundaries of its proper territory, namely practical principles.
 
 a Object b "The time does not need these defenses." The complete quotation is "Non tali auxilio, nee defensoribus istis tempus eget" (Virgil, Aeneid 11.5, 2I); in the translation by Robert Fitzgerald, "The time is past for help like this, for this kind of defending" (Virgil, The Aeneid, tr. Robert Fitzgerald [New York: Random House, I98I], p. 5I). The line is spo足 ken by Hecuba to Priam as the aged king of Troy arms himself against the Greeks in the final death throes of his city.
