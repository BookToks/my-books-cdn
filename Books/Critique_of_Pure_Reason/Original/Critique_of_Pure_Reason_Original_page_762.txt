He was certainly acquainted with it by the time of his Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion (probably 1783), 27:1062-4.
 
 I I I Surely this is an allusion to the title of Kant's own The Only Possible Ground ofProof(I763), which, however, not only intends that the title de­ scribe an argument different from the ontological argument, but even contains Kant's first statement of his critique of the ontological argument (2:72-7, 156-7).
 
 I I2 See R 41 I 3 (1769? 177o-71? 17:420-2) for an early sketch of the several options for theology discussed in this section.
 
 I 13 Of course, Kant will explore the idea of a practical foundation for the­ ology much more fully in the "Canon of Pure Reason" below, as well as in the Critique of Practical Reason and Critique of Judgment. But see also R 5624 (1778-79? 1780-81? 259-60) and R 6086-117 (1783-88, 18:445-60).
 
 114 Kant's assessment of physico-theology now seems to agree more with that found in The Only Possible Ground of Proof See note 108 above.
 
 I 15 There are few notes bearing on this appendix; for one, see R 5602 (I 778-80s, 18:247).
 
 I 16 This principle is now commonly called "Ockham's razor" after William of Ockham (c.I288-1350). Ockham certainly did employ some such princi­ ple often, but the closest formulation to the one Kant quotes is "pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate" (plurality is not to be posited without ne­ cessity). The wording quoted by Kant is derived from the later scholastic Ioannes Poncius (d. 1660), who refers to "axioma vulgare .. .f requenter un­ untur Scholastici: Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate" (the common axiom frequently enunciated by the scholastics: Entities are not to be mul­ tiplied without necessity), Commentarii Theologici quibus 10. Duns Scoti Quaestiones in libros Sent. III d.34 (Paris, 1661), IV:387. As this citation (to a commentary on John Dun Scotus) would suggest, the principle was enunciated and employed by Scotus before it was ever used by Ockham.
 
 But it became especially associated with Ockham's name, doubtless be­ cause he was well known for his ontological parsimony and reductionist analyses -since he even frequently used the principle he derived from Scotus to criticize Scotus himself. The original source of the principle was Aristotle (Physics 1:4 [188aI7-18], 1:6 [189aI4-151, Topics VIhI I [162a245]). Cf. Rega Wood, Ockham on the Virtues (West Lafayette, In: Purdue, 1997), pp. 20, 36.
 
 I 17 Wit (Witz, ingenium) is an innate talent of the mind. It takes two forms: ingenium comparans, a talent for comparing and assimilating things that are superficially different, and ingenium argutans, a talent for making sub­ tle distinctions. In this passage, he seems to have the former sort of wit in mind, since it is the power of discrimination which sets limits to it. Cf.
 
 Anthropology § 54, 7:220.
 
 II8 This formulation occurs already at R 5080 (1776-78, 18:81).
