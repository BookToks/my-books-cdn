Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II be grounded in some intelligible being (which is therefore free of every empirical condition, containing, rather, the ground of the possibility of all these appearances).
 
 But here it is not at all the intenta to prove the unconditionally nec­ essary existence of any being, or even to ground the possibility of a merely intelligible condition of existence in the world of sense on it; rather, just as we limit reason so that it does not abandon the thread of the empirical conditions, and stray into transcendent grounds of ex­ planation which do not admit of any exhibition in concreto, so on the other side we limit the law of the merely empirical use of the under­ standing, so that it does not decide the possibility of things in general, nor declare the intelligible, even though it is not to be used by us in ex­ plaining appearances, to be impossible. Thus it has been shown only that the thoroughgoing contingency of all natural things and all of na­ ture's (empirical) conditions can very well coexist with the option alb presupposition of a necessary, even though merely intelligible condi­ tion, and thus that there is no true contradiction between these asser­ tions, hence they can both be true. Such an absolutely necessary being of the understanding may always be impossible in itself, yet this can by AS63/BS91 no means be inferred from the universal contingency and dependence of everything belonging to the world of sense, nor can it be inferred from the principle' that we should not stop with any individual member of it and appeal to a cause outside the world. Reason goes its way in its empirical use, and a special way in a transcendental use.
 
 The world of sense contains nothing but appearances, but these are mere representations, which are once again always sensibly condi­ tioned, and, since here we never have to do with things in themselves as our objects, it is no wonder that we are never justified in making a leap from one member of the empirical series, whatever it might be, outside the connections of sensibility, just as if these members were things in themselves existing outside their transcendental ground, which one might leave behind in seeking the cause of their existence outside them­ selves; of course that would have to happen with contingent things, but not with mere representations of things, whose contingency itself is only a phenomenon, and can lead to no other regress but the one de­ termining phenomena, i.e., the one which is empirical. But to think of an intelligible ground for appearances, i.e., for the world of sense, and of appearances freed from the contingency of the world of sense, is op­ posed neither to the unlimited empirical regress in the series of ap�5641 B 592 pearances nor to their thoroughgoing contingency. But that is also the a Meinung willkiirlich b , Princip 548 Section IX.
