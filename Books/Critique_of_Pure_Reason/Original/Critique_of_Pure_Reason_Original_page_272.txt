Trans. deduction of pure concepts of understanding <B> ing subject cognize my self as an objecta that is thought, insofar as I am also given to myself in intuition, only, like other phenomena, not as I am for the understanding but rather as I appear to myself, this is no more and no less difficult than how I can be an objectb for myself in general and indeed one of intuition and inner perceptions. But that it B 156 really must be so can be clearly shown, if one lets space count as a mere pure form of the appearances of outer sense, from the fact that time, although is not itself an object of outer intuition at all, cannot be made representable to us except under the image of a line, insofar as we draw it, without which sort of presentation we could not know the unity of its measure at all, or likewise from the fact that we must always derive the determination of the length of time or also of the positions in time for all inner perceptions from that which presents external things to us as alterable; hence we must order the determinations of inner sense as appearances in time in just the same way as we order those of outer sense in space; hence if we admit about the latter that we cognize objectsC by their means only insofar as we are externally affected, then we must also concede that through inner sense we intuit ourselves only as we are internally affected by our selves, i.e., as far as inner intuition is concerned we cognize our own subject only as appearance but not in ac­ cordance with what it is in itself.*A3 § 25· BI57 In the transcendental synthesis of the manifold of representations in general, on the contrary, hence in the synthetic original unity of apper­ ception, I am conscious of myself not as I appear to myself, nor as I am in myself, but only that I am. This representation is a thinking, not an intuiting. Now since for the cognition of ourselves, in addition to the action of thinking that brings the manifold of every possible intuition to the unity of apperception, a determinate sort of intuition, through which this manifold is given, is also required, my own existence * I do not see how one can find so many difficulties in the fact that inner sense B 156 is affected by ourselves. Every actd of attention can give us an example oft his.
 
 In such acts the understanding always determines the inner sense, in accor- B 157 dance with the combination that it thinks, to the inner intuition that corresponds to the manifold in the synthesis of the understanding. How much the mind is commonly affected by this means, everyone will be able to perceive in himself.
