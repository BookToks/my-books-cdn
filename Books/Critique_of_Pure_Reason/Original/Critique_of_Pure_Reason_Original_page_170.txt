On Space <A> In the transcendental aesthetic we will therefore first isolate sensibil- A22 ity by separating off everything that the understanding thinks through its concepts, so that nothing but empirical intuition remains. Second, we will then detach from the latter everything that belongs to sensation, so that nothing remains except pure intuition and the mere form of ap­ pearances, which is the only thing that sensibility can make available a priori. In this investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms of sensible intuition as principlesa of priori cognition, namely space a and time, with the assessment of which we will now be concerned.

 \ , By means of outer sense (a property of our mind) we represent to our­ selves objects as outside us, and all as in space. In space their form, magnitude, and relation to one another is determined, or deter­ minable,lInner sense, by means of which the mind intuits itself, or its inner sta��, gives, to be sure, no intuition of the soul itself, as an object;b yet it is still a determinate form, under which the intuition of its A 2 3 inner state is alone possible, so that everything that belongs to the inner determinations is represented in relations of time. Time can no more be intuited externally than space can be intuited as something in us. Now what are space and time? Are they actual entities?'" Are they only determinations or relations of things, yet ones that would pertain to them even if they were not intuited, or are they relations that only attach to the form of intuition alone, and thus to the subjective consti- B 38 tution of our mind, without which these predicates could not be as­ cribed to any thing at all?5 In order to instruct ourselves about this, we will consider space first.6 I) Space is not an empirical concept that has been drawn from outer experiences. For in order for certain sensations to be relatedd to some­ thing outside me (i.e., to something in another place in space from that in which I find myself), thus in order for me to represent them as out­ side one another, thus not merely as different but as in different places, the representation of space must already be their ground) Thus the representation of space cannot be obtained from the relations of outer Principien « Object b , wirkliche Wesen bezogen d 157 Doctrine of Elements.
