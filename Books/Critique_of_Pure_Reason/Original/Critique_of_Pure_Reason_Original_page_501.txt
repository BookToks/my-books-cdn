Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II during the course of the world. For here we are talking of an absolute beginning not, as far as time is concerned, but as far as causality is con­ cerned. If (for example) I am now entirely free, and get up from my chair without the necessarily determining influence of natural causes, then in this occurrence, along with its natural consequences to infinity, there begins an absolutely new series, even though as far as time is con­ cerned this occurrence is only the continuation of a previous series. For this decision and deed do not lie within the succession of merely nat­ ural effects and are not a mere continuation of them; rather, the deter­ mining natural causes of that series entirely cease in regard to this event, which indeed follows upon that series, but does not follow from it;a and therefore it must be called, not as far as time is concerned but in regard to causality, an absolutely first beginning of a series of appearances.
 
 The confirmation of the need of reason to appeal to a first beginning from freedom in the series of natural causes is clearly and visibly evident from the fact that (with the exception of the Epicurean school) all the philosophers of antiquity saw themselves as obliged to assume a first mover65 for the explanation of motions in the world, i.e., a freely act­ ing cause, which began this series of states first and from itself. For they did not venture to make a first beginning comprehensible on the basis of mere nature.
