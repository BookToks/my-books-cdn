a,I PREFACE AVll Human reason has the peculiar fate in one species of its cognitions that it is burdened with questions which it cannot dismiss, since they are given to it as problemsb by the nature of reason itself, but which it also cannot answer, since they transcend every capacity" of human reason.
 
 Reason falls into this perplexity through no fault of its own. It begins from principles whose use is unavoidable in the course of experience and at the same time sufficiently warranted by it. With these principles it rises (as its nature also requires) ever higher, to more remote condi­ tions. But since it becomes aware in this way that its business must al­ AVlll ways remain incomplete because the questions never cease, reason sees itself necessitated to take refuge in principles that overstep all possible use in experience, and yet seem so unsuspicious that even ordinary common sense agrees with them. But it thereby falls into obscurity and contradictions, from which it can indeed surmise that it must some­ where be proceeding on the ground of hidden errors; but it cannot dis­ cover them, for the principles on which it is proceeding, since they surpass the bounds of all experience, no longer recognize any touch­ stone of experience. The battlefield of these endless controversies is called metaphysics.
 
 There was a time when metaphysics was called the queen of all the sciences, and if the will be taken for the deed, it deserved this title of honor, on account of the preeminent importance of its object. Now, in accordance with the fashion of the age, the queen proves despised on all sides; and the matron, outcast and forsaken, mourns like Hecuba: Modo maxima rerum, tot generis natisque potens -nunc trahor exul, inops Ovid, Aix Metamorphoses. d In the beginning, under the administration of the dogmatists,2 her rule was despotic. Yet because her legislation still retained traces of an­ cient barbarism, this rule gradually degenerated through internal wars into complete anarchy; and the skeptics,3 a kind of nomads who abhor all permanent cultivation of the soil, shattered civil unity from time to a As in the first edition. Kant wrote a new preface for the second edition, given below.
