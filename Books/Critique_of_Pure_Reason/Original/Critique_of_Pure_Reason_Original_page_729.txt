For if the observed object and the ob­ server are moving in the same direction with equal velocity, no motion will be detected. Now it is from the earth that we visually apprehend the revo­ lution of the heavens. If, then, any movement is ascribed to the earth, that motion will generate the appearance of itself in all things which are exter­ nal to it, though as occurring in the opposite direction, as if everything were passing across the earth. This will be especially true of the daily rev­ olution. For it seems to seize upon the whole universe, and indeed upon everything that is around the earth, though not the earth itself . . .As the heavens, which contain and cover everything, are the common locus of things, it is not at all evident why it should be to the containing rather than to the contained, to the located rather than to the locating, that motion is ascribed" (Nicolaus Copernicus [1473-1543], De revolutionibus orbium coeles­ tium [Nuremberg, IS43] 1:5)· 17 The claim that metaphysics has only a negative theoretical use but a posi­ tive practical use will be one of Kant's most fundamental philosophical the­ ses. In addition to the "Canon of Pure Reason" below and the Critique of Practical Reason and Critique of Judgment, see the following notes: R 4284 (1770-71? 1773-7S? 1776-78? 18:4S); R 4892 (1776-78, 18:50); R 5112 (1776-78, 18:93), where Kant uses the same metaphor as the present pas­ sage and says that "Metaphysics is as it were the police of our reason with regard to the public security of morals and religion"; R S073 (1776-78, 18:79-80), where Kant uses instead a medical metaphor; R 5119 (1776-78, 18:96-7); and Kant's important comment on the character of his own ide­ alism, perhaps written shortly after the publication of the first edition of the Critique, R 5642 (1780-81, I�:279-82).

 19 Kant's dissatisfaction with the exposition of the new "Refutation ofIdeal­ ism," which he had added to the second edition of the Critique (B 2 74-9) is evident from this further attempt at getting it right. This footnote is in fact only the beginning of further attempts, in 1788 and 1790, to perfect this crucial argument; see the note to B 274 for references to these attempts.
 
 Introduction In R 2740, Kant defines experience as "perception with rules." In R 2741, he defines experience as "the agreement of perceptions (of empirical repre­ sentations) to the cognition of an object" (both notes from 1775-79; at 16:494). These two definitions may seem distinct, but will turn out to be identical when cognition of an object is subsequently reduced to agreement with rules (e.g., A 104, B 137)' 2 An argument that the distinction between a priori and a posteriori cognition precedes all other philosophical distinctions can be found in R 4851 (18:8-10), from 1776-78, which also offers a sketch of the systematic divi­ sion of the whole of philosophy as Kant saw it at this point.
 
 3 At R 4851 (1776-78), Kant asserts that the distinction between a priori and a posteriori precedes that between the sensible and intelligible, giving rise to 716 Notes to pages 130-137 the distinction between two different types of a priori knowledge that es­ caped Plato and Leibniz (18:8-10).
