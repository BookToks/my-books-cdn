On the ideas in general The Platonic republic has become proverbial as a supposedly strik- A 3 16 ing example of a dream of perfection that can have its place only in the idle thinker's brain; and Bruckerl3 finds it ridiculous for the philosopher to assert that a prince will never govern well unless he participates in the ideas. But we would do better to pursue this thought further, and (at those points where the excellent man leaves us without help) to shed light on it through new endeavors, rather than setting it aside as useless under the very wretched and harmful pretext of its impracticability. A B 373 constitution providing for the greatest human freedom according to laws that permit the freedom of each to exist together with that of others (not one providing for the greatest happiness, since that would follow of itself) is at least a necessary idea, which one must make the ground not merely of the primary plan of a state's constitution but of all the laws too; and in it we must initially abstract from the present obstacles, which may perhaps arise not so much from what is unavoidable in human nature as rather from neglect of the true ideas in the giving of laws. For nothing is more harmful or less worthy of a philosopher than the vulgar appeal to allegedly contrary experience, which would not have existed at all if institutions had been established at the right time according to the ideas, instead of frustrating all good intentions by A 3 I 7 using crude concepts in place of ideas, just because these concepts were drawn from experience. The more legislation and government agree with this idea, the less frequent punishment will become, and hence it is quite rational to assert (as Plato does) that in perfect institutional arrangements nothing of the sort would be necessary at all. 14 Even though this may never come to pass, the idea of this maximum is nev­ ertheless wholly correct when it is set forth as an archetype, in order to B 374 bring the legislative constitution of human beings ever nearer to a possible greatest perfection. For whatever might be the highest degree of perfection at which humanity must stop, and however great a gulf must remain between the idea and its execution, no one can or should try to determine this, just because it is freedom that can go beyond every proposed boundary.
 
 But Plato was right to see clear proofs of an origin in ideas not only where human reason shows true causality, and where ideas become ef­ ficient causes (of actions and their objects), namely in morality, but also in regard to nature itself.15 A plant, an animal, the regular arrangement of the world's structure (presumably thus also the whole order of nature) -these show clearly that they are possible only according to ideas; A3I8 although no individual creature, under the individual conditions of its existence, is congruent with the idea of what is most perfect of its species (as little as a human being is congruent with the idea of humanity that he bears in his soul as the archetype of his actions), nevertheless these ideas :'-re in the highest understanding individual, unalterable, 397 Doctrine of Elements.
