Ch. III i.e., from the chief end of reason, but empirically, in accordance with aims occurring contingently (whose number" one cannot know in ad­ vance), yields technical unity, but that which arises only in consequence of an idea (where reason provides the ends a priori and does not await them empirically) grounds architectonic unity. \Vhat we call science, whose schema contains the outline (monogramma) and the division of the whole into members in conformity with the idea, i.e., a priori, can­ not arise technically, from the similarity of the manifold or the contin­ gent use of cognition in concreto for all sorts of arbitrary external ends, but arises architectonically, for the sake of its affinity and its derivation from a single supreme and inner end, which first makes possible the A834/B 862 whole; such a science must be distinguished from all others with cer­ tainty and in accordance with principles.b Nobody attempts to establish a science without grounding it on an idea. But in its elaboration the schema, indeed even the definition of the science which is given right at the outset, seldom corresponds to the idea; for this lies in reason like a seed, all of whose parts still lie very in­ voluted and are hardly recognizable even under microscopic observa­ tion. For this reason sciences, since they have all been thought out from the viewpoint of a certain general interest, must not be explained and determined in accordance with the description given by their founder, but rather in accordance with the idea, grounded in reason itself, of the natural unity of the parts that have been brought together. For the founder and even his most recent successors often fumble around with an idea that they have not even made distinct to themselves and that therefore cannot determine the special content, the articulation (sys­ tematic unity) and boundaries of the science.
 
 It is too bad that it is first possible for us to glimpse the idea in a clearer light and to outline a whole architectonically, in accordance with the ends of reason, only after we have long collected relevant cognitions haphazardly' like building materials and worked through them techniA83 5 / B 863 cally with only a hint from an idea lying hidden within us. The systems seem to have been formed, like maggots, by a generatio aequivoca39 from the mere confluence of aggregated concepts, garbled at first but com­ plete in time, although they all had their schema, as the original seed, in the mere self-development of reason, and on that account are not merely each articulated for themselves in accordance with an idea but are rather all in turn purposively united with each other as members of a whole in a system of human cognition, and allow an architectonic to all human knowledge, which at the present time, since so much matera lWenge b Principien , rhapsodistisch 692 The architectonic of pure reason ial has already been collected or can be taken from the ruins of col­ lapsed older edifices, would not merely be possible but would not even be very difficult.
