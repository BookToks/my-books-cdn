IIS The outcome of all dialectical attempts of pure reason not only con­ firms what we have already proved in the Transcendental Analytic, namely that all the inferences that would carry us out beyond the field of possible experience are deceptive and groundless, but it also simulta­ neously teaches us this particular lesson: that human reason has a nat­ ural propensity to overstep all these boundaries, and that transcendental ideas are just as natural to it as the categories are to the understanding, although with this difference, that just as the categories lead to truth, i.e., to the agreement of our concepts with their objects,a the ideas ef­ fect a mere, but irresistible, illusion, deception by which one can hardly resist even through the most acute criticism.
 
 Everything grounded in the nature of our powers must be purposive and consistent with their correct use, if only we can guard against a cerA643/B671 tain misunderstanding and find out their proper direction. Thus the transcendental ideas too will presumably have a good and consequently immanent use, even though, if their significance is misunderstood and they are taken for concepts of real things, they can be transcendent in their application and for that very reason deceptive. For in regard to the whole of possible experience, it is not the idea itself but only its use that can be either extravagant (transcendent) or indigenous (imma­ nent), according to whether one directs them straightway to a supposed object corresponding to them, or only to the use of the understanding in general regarding the objects with which it has to do; and all errors of subreption are always to be ascribed to a defect in judgment, never to understanding or to reason.
 
 Reason never relates directly to an object, but solely to the under­ standing and by means of it to reason's own empirical use, hence it does not create any concepts (of objects)b but only orders them and gives a Objecte Objecte b 590 Section VII.
