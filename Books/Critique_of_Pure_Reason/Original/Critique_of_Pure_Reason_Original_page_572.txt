On the proofs of the existence of a highest being passing experience, the material for the possibility of all objects of sense has to be presupposed as given in one sum total; and all possibility of em­ pirical objects, their difference from one another and their thoroughgo­ ing determination, can rest only on the limitation of this sum total. Now in fact no other objects except those of sense can be given to us, and they can be given nowhere except in the context of a possible experience; con­ sequently, nothing is an object for us unless it presupposes the sum total of all empirical reality as condition of its possibility.92 In accordance with a natural illusion, we regard as a principle that must hold of all things in general that which properly holds only of those which are given as ob­ jects of our senses. Consequently, through the omission of this limitation we will take the empirical principle a of our concepts of the possibility of things as appearances to be a transcendental principle b of the possibility of things in general.
 
 That we subsequently hypostatize this idea of the sum total of all re­ ality, however, comes about because we dialectically transform the dis­ tributive unity of the use of the understanding in experience, into the collective unity of a whole of experience; and from this whole of ap­ pearance we think up an individual thing containing in itself all empirical reality,93 which then -by means of the transcendental subreption A 583 / B 661 we have already thought -is confused with the concept of a thing that stands at the summit of the possibility of all things, providing the real conditions for their thoroughgoing determination.* Chapter Three Section Three The grounds of proof of speculative reason for inferring the existence of a highest being.
 
 In spite of its urgent need to presuppose something that the under­ standing could take as the complete ground for the thoroughgoing de­ termination of its concepts, reason notices the ideal and merely fictive * This ideal of the supremely real being, even though it is a mere representation, is first realized, i.e., made into an object,' then hypostatized, and finally, as we will presently allege, through a natural progress of reason in the completion of unity, it is even personified;94 for the regulative unity of experience rests not on appearances themselves (of sensibility alone), but on the connection of its manifold by understanding (in one apperception); hence the unity of the highest reality and the thoroughgoing determinability (possibility) of all things seems to lie in a highest understanding, hence in an intelligence.
