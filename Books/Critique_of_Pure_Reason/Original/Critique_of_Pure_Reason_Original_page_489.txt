Proof For, assume that composite substances do not consist of simple parts: then, if all composition is removed in thought, no composite part, and (since there are no simple parts) no simple part, thus nothing at all would be left over; consequently, no substance would be given. Thus ei­ ther it is impossible to remove all composition in thought or else after its removal something must be left over that subsists without any com­ position, i.e., the simple. In the first case, the composite would once again not consist of substances (because with substances composition is only a contingent relation,a apart from which, as beings persisting by A436/B464 themselves, they must subsist). Now since this case contradicts the pre­ supposition, only the second case is left: namely, that what is a substan­ tial composite in the world consists of simple parts.6I From this it follows immediately that all things in the world are sim­ ple beings, that composition is only an external state of these beings, and that even though we can never put these elementary substances completely outside this state of combination and isolate them, reason must still think of them as the primary subjects of all composition and hence think of them prior to it as simple beings.b a Relation b In the first edition, Kant notes: "In the intellectual, if all division is brought to an end, the simple remains. In the sensible it can never be brought to an end. In thoughts, if it is cancelled, nothing remains." (E CLXVII, p. 50; 23:40) 476 The Antinomy of Pure Reason Second Conflict of the Transcendental Ideas Antithesis No composite thing in the world consists of simple parts, and nowhere in it does there exist anything simple.
