Critique of all speculative theology ness, affinity, a unity, each taken, however, as ideab in the highest de­ gree of their completeness. Reason presupposes those cognitions of the understanding which are first applied to experience, and seeks the unity of these cognitions in accordance with ideas that go much further than experience can reach. The affinity C of the manifold, without detriment to its variety, under a principled of unity, concerns not merely the things, but even more the mere properties and powers of things. Hence if, e.g., the course of the planets is given to us as circular through a (still not fully corrected) experience, and we find variations, then we suppose these variations to consist in an orbit that can deviate from the circle through each of an infinity of intermediate degrees according to con­ stant laws; i.e., we suppose that the movements of the planets that are not a circle will more or less approximate to its properties, and then we come upon the ellipse. The comets show an even greater variety in their paths, since (as far as observation reaches) they do not ever return in a circle; yet we guess at a parabolic course for them, since it is still akin' to the ellipse and, if the major axis of the latter is very long, it cannot be distinguished from it in all our observations. Thus under the guid- A663/B691 ance of those principles f we come to a unity of genera in the forms of these paths, but thereby also further to unity in the cause of all the laws of this motion (gravitation); from there we extend our conquests, seeking to explain all variations and apparent deviations from those rules on the basis of the same principle;g finally we even add on more than experience can ever confirm, namely in accordance with the rules of affinity,h even conceiving hyperbolical paths for comets in which these bodies leave our solar system entirely and, going from sun to sun, unite in their course the most remote parts of a world system, which for us is unbounded yet connected through one and the same moving force.i What is strange about these principles,i and what alone concerns us, is this: that they seem to be transcendental, and even though they con­ tain mere ideas to be followed in the empirical use of reason, which reason can follow only asymptotically, as it were, i.e., merely by apa Verwandtschaft b jede derselben aber als Ideen ...K ant's pronoun and noun do not agree in number; with Erdmann, we read Idee (singular).
