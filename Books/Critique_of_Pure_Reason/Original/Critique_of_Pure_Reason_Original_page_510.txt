On the interest of reason in these conflicts reason) rests on the fact that since in the great as well as the small, in its order and regularity, and in the admirable unity of the forces moving nature, mathematics guides reason's insight into nature far beyond every expectation of any philosophy built on common experience, it gives occasion and encouragement even to the use of reason which ex­ tends beyond all experience, just as it provides to the philosophy a con­ cerned with nature the most excellent materials for supporting its inquiries, as far as their characterb allows, with appropriate intuitions.
 
 Unfortunately for speculation (but perhaps fortunately for the practi­ cal vocation)C of humanity, reason sees itself, in the midst of its greatest expectations, so entangled in a crowd of arguments and counterargu­ mentsd that it is not feasible, on account either of its honor or even of its security, for reason to withdraw and look upon the quarrel with in­ difference, as mere shadow boxing, still less for it simply to command peace, interested as it is in the object of the dispute; so nothing is left ex­ cept to reflect on the origin of this disunity of reason with itself, on whether a mere misunderstanding might perhaps be responsible for it, after the elucidation of which perhaps both sides will give up their proud A465 / B493 claims, but in place of which reason would begin a rule of lasting tranquility over understanding and sense.
 
 For now we will postpone this fundamental inquiry a little longer, and first take into consideration on which side we would prefer to fight if we were forced to take sides. Since in this case we would consult not the logical criterion of truth but merely our interest, our present inves­ tigation, even though it would settle nothing in regard to the disputed e rights of both parties, will have the utility of making it comprehensible why the participants in this dispute have sooner taken one side than the other, even if no superior insight into the object has been the cause of it, and it likewise explains still other ancillary things, e.g., the zealous heat of the one side and the cold assurance of the other, and why they!

 But there is something which, in this provisional estimate, deter­ mines the standpoint from which it can be carried out with appropriate thoroughness, and that is a comparison of the principlesg from which Weltweisheit a h Beschaffenheit , Bestimmung GrUnden und Gegengrini den d , streitig; the first edition reads "strittig" (disputable, questionable).
 
 f This plural pronoun has no plausible nearby referent; both Muller and Kemp Smith translate it as "the world"; but probably its antecedent is supposed to be the "partici­ pants in this dispute" (who, Kant says, "have sooner taken one part than the other").
