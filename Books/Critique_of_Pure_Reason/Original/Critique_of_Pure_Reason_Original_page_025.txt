The second analogy is generally supposed to supply Kant's answer to Hume's skeptical doubts about causality, while the third analogy is the basis for Kant's refutation of Leibniz's rejection of real interaction be­ tween independent substances -an essential thesis of Leibniz's "mon­ adology." In particular, both what the second analogy is intended to prove and how the proof is supposed to proceed have been matters of exegetical controversy; they have been disputed almost as intensely as the philosophical question whether Kant's reply to Hume is successful.
 
 In the first edition of the Critique, the final section of the "System of Principles," the "Postulates of Empirical Thought," provides conditions for the empirical use of the modal categori�s of possibility, existence, and necessity, and argues that our determinate use of the categories of both possibility and necessity is in fact confined to the sphere of the actual, that is, that which is actually given in experience (A2 18-35 IB 265-74, 279-87). In the second edition, however, Kant inserted a new argument, the "Refutation ofIdealism" (B 274-9), which attempts to show that the very possibility of our consciousness of ourselves presupposes the exis­ tence of an external world of objects that are not only represented as spatially outside us but are also conceived to exist independently of our subjective representations of them. Although the implications of this ar­ gument have been intensely debated, it seems to confirm Kant's claim in the Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics that his "transcendental ideal­ ism" is a "critical" or "formal" idealism that, unlike traditional idealism, implies the subjectivity of space and time as forms of intuition without denying the real existence of the objects distinct from ourselves that are represented as being in space and time. 18 In the third chapter of the "Analytic of Principles," on phenomena and noumena, Kant emphasizes that because the categories must always be applied to data provided by sensibility in order to provide cognition, and because the data of sensibility are structured by the transcenden­ tally ideal forms of intuition, the categories give us knowledge only of things as they appear with sensibility ("phenomena," literally "that which appears"). Although through pure understanding (noils in Greek) we may think of objects independently of their being given in sensibil­ ity, we can never cognize them as such non-sensible entities ("noumena," literally "that which is thought") (A235-6o/B294-315). The meaning of Kant's use of the term "phenomena" is self-evident, but the meaning of "noumena" is not, since it literally means not "things as they are in­ dependently of appearing to us" but something more like "things as they are understood by pure thought." Yet Kant appears to deny that the human understanding can comprehend things in the latter way. For 12 Introduction this reason, Kant says it is legitimate for us to speak of noumena only "in a negative sense," meaning things as they may be in themselves in­ dependently of our representation of them, but not noumena "in a pos­ itive sense," which would be things known through pure reason alone.
