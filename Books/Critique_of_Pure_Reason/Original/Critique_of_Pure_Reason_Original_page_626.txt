Critique of all speculative theology rience, hence all conditions for thinking an object for such a concept, which alone and solely makes it possible for one to say that it has any sense.
 
 The second regulative idea of merely speculative reason is the con­ cept of the world in general. For nature is really the single given objecta in regard to which reason needs regulative principles.b This nature is twofold: either thinking nature or corporeal nature. Yet to think of the latter as regards its inner possibility, i.e., to determine the application of the categories to it, we do not need any idea, i.e., any representation transcending experience; no such representation is possible in regard to it, because here we are guided merely by sensible intuition -not as with the fundamental psychological concept (the I), which contains priori a a certain form of thinking, namely its unity. Thus for pure reason there is nothing left to us except nature in general, and the completeness of A68S/B713 conditions in it in accordance with some one principle.c The absolute totality of the series of these conditions in the derivation of their members is an idea which of course can never come about fully in the empirical use of reason, but nevertheless serves as a rule for the way we ought to proceed in regard to them: namely that in the explanation of given appearances (in a regress or ascent), we ought to proceed as if the series were in itself infinite, i.e., proceed in indefinitum;'22 but where reason itself is considered as the determining cause (in the case of freedom), hence in the case of practical principles,d we should proceed as if we did not have before us an objecte of sense but one of pure understanding, where the conditions can no longer be posited in the series of appearances, but are posited outside it, and the series of states can be regarded as ifi t began absolutely (through an intelligible cause); all this proves that the cosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles/ and are far from positing, as it were constitutively, an actual totality in such series. The rest one can seek in its place in the Antinomy of Pure Reason. 12 3 The third idea of pure reason, which contains a merely relative sup­ positiong of a being as the sole and all-sufficient cause of all cosmological series, is the rational concept of God. We do not have the least A686/B714 reason to assume absolutely (to supposeh in itself) the object of this idea; for what could enable or even justify us in believing or asserting a a Object Principien b Princip C d Principien Object C f Principien Supposition g supponieren h 613 Doctrine of Elements.
