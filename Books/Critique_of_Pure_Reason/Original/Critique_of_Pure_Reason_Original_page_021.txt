This is Kant's famous doctrine of transcendental idealism, which is employed throughout the Critique of Pure Reason (and the two subsequent critiques) in a variety of ways, both positively, as in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" and "Dis­ cipline of Pure Reason," to account for the possibility of synthetic a pri­ ori cognition in mathematics, and negatively, as in the "Transcendental Dialectic," to limit the scope of our cognition to the appearances given to our sensibility, while denying that we can have any cognition of things as they are in themselves, that is, as transcendent realities con­ stituted as they are independently of the constitution of our cognitive capacities.
 
 "Transcendental Analytic": the metaphysical and transcenden­ tal deductions. The longest and most varied part of the Critique is the "Transcendental Logic," containing the two main divisions: the con­ structive "Transcendental Analytic," which considers the understanding as the source of a priori concepts that yield a priori cognitions in con­ junction with the forms of intuition already analyzed; and the primarily destructive "Transcendental Dialectic," which investigates the faculty of reason, in the first instance as a source of illusory arguments and meta­ physical pseudo-sciences, although in the end also as the source of valu­ able regulative principles for the conduct of human inquiry and practical reasoning. The "Transcendental Analytic," as we saw, is in turn divided into two books, the "Analytic of Concepts," dealing with the concepts of the understanding, and the "Analytic of Principles," con­ cerning the principles of the understanding that arise from the applica­ tion of those concepts to the forms of intuition.
 
 In the "Analytic of Concepts," Kant presents the understanding as the source of certain concepts that are a priori and are conditions of the possibility of any experience whatever. These twelve basic concepts, which Kant calls the categories, are fundamental concepts of an object in general, or the forms for any particular concepts of objects, and in con­ junction with the a priori forms of intuition are the basis of all synthetic a priori cognition. In an initial section of the "Transcendental Analytic" (A66-81/B91-II6), which he named in the second edition of the Critique the "metaphysical deduction" of the categories (B 159), Kant derives the twelve categories from a table of the twelve logical functions or forms of judgments, the logically significant aspects of all judg­ ments. Kant's idea is that just as there are certain essential features of all judgments, so there must be certain corresponding ways in which we form the concepts of objects so that judgments may be about objects.
 
 8 Introduction There are four main logical features of judgments: their quantity, or the scope of their subject-terms; the quality of their predicate-terms, whose contents are realities and negations; their relation, or whether they as­ sert a relation just between a subject and predicate or between two or more subject-predicate judgments; and their modality, or whether they assert a possible, actual, or necessary truth.
