Systematic representation of all synthetic principles outer experiences, that this very same formative a synthesis by means of which we construct a figure in imagination is entirely identical with that which we exercise in the apprehension of an appearance in order to make a concept of experience of it -it is this alone that connects with this concept the representation of the possibility of such a thing. And thus the possibility of continuous magnitudes, indeed even of magni­ tudes in general, since the concepts of them are all synthetic, is never clear from the concepts themselves, but only from them as formal conditions of the determination of objects in experience in general; and B 272 where should one want to seek objects that correspond to the concepts, if not in the experience through which alone objects are given to us? -although without anticipating experience itself we can cognize and characterize the possibility of things solely in relation to the formal conditions under which something can be determined as an object in experience at all, thus fully a priori but only in relationb to these conditions and within their boundaries.82 The postulate for cognizing the actuality of things requires percep- A 2 2 5 tion, thus sensation of which one is conscious -not immediate perception of the object itself the existence of which is to be cognized, but still its connection with some actual perception in accordance with the analogies of experience, which exhibit all real connection in an experience in general.
 
 In the mere concept of a thing no characteristic of its existence can be encountered at all. For even if this concept is so complete that it lacks nothing required for thinking of a thing with all of its inner detennina­ tions, still existence has nothing in the least to do with all of this, but only with the question of whether such a thing is given to us in such a way that the perception of it could in any case precede the concept. For that the concept precede the perception signifies its mere possibility; but B 273 perception, which yields the material for the concept, is the sole characteristic of actuality. However, one can also cognize the existence of the thing prior to the perception of it, and therefore cognize it comparatively a priori, if only it is connectedC with some perceptions in accordance with the principles of their empirical connection d (the analogies).
 
 For in that case the existence of the thing is still connectede with our perceptions in a possible experience, and with the guidance of the analo- A226 gies we can get from our actual perceptions to the thing in the series of possible perceptions.
