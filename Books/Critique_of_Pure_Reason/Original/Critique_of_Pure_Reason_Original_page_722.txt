 59 Kant uses the Latin word intuitus to signify the immediate and singular rep­ resentations offered by the senses; see the inaugural dissertation, De mundi sensibilis atque intelligibilis forma et principiis (On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World), § I, 2:387; § 10, 2:396; § 14-3, 2:399; and § I5.C, 2:402. In the Critique of Pure Reason, he will employ the analo­ gously formed German word Anschauung for the same purpose. In view of Kant's original Latin word, his German word has traditionally been trans­ lated as "intuition." Some have objected to this because of some of the con­ notations of "intuition" in English, but it seems better to us to preserve the traditional Latinate translation, reminding the reader that whatever asso­ ciations this and other terms might suggest, their meaning in Kant's ar­ gument must be defined by what he says about them and not by such antecedent associations.

 61 De mundi, §§ 3-4, 2:392; Walford, p. 38462 Thus Kant originally uses the term "noumena" in what the Critique pro­ scribes as its "positive" rather than permissible "negative" sense (B 307).
 
 Whether Kant fully purges the positive sense of "noumena" from the Cri­ tique, especially from his argument in the "Antinomy of Pure Reason," is a difficult question of interpretation.
 
 63 Pierre Bayle had made a number of such paradoxes prominent in his arti­ cle on "Zeno of Elea" in his widely read Historical and Critical Dictionary, first published in 1687 (a translation can be found in Pierre Bayle, Historical and Critical DictionalY, trans. Richard H. Popkin [Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Co., 1991], pp. 350-88). Bayle's article was influential for Berkeley; see his Principles of Human Knowledge, e.g., § 118 (in The Works of George Berkeley, ed. A. A. Luce and T. E.]essup [Edinburgh: Thos. Nelson, 1949), Vol. 2, pp. 94-5). Berkeley's treatment of the paradoxes of the infi­ nite may in turn have influenced Hume; see Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, section XII, part II (in Hume's Enquiries, ed. L. A. Selby­ Bigge, 3rd. ed. revised by P. H. Nidditch [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975], pp. 155-7)· 64 See especially Bxxiv-xxx in the second-edition preface to the Critique.
