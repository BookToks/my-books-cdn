Impossibility of a cosmological proof real properties in a thing is a synthesis about whose possibility we can­ not judge priori because the realities are not given to us specifi­ a cally -and even if this were to happen no judgment at all could take place because the mark of possibility of synthetic cognitions always has to be sought only in experience, to which, however, the object of an idea can never belong -the famous Leibniz was far from having achieved what he flattered himself he had done, namely, gaining insight priori a into the possibility of such a sublime ideal being.99 Thus the famous ontological (Cartesian) prooflOo of the existence of a highest being from concepts is only so much trouble and labor lost, and a human being can no more become richer in insight from mere ideas than a merchant could in resources if he wanted to improve his fi­ nancial state by adding a few zeros to his cash balance.
 
 Chapter Three A603/B63I Section Five On the impossibility of a cosmological proof of God's existence. 101 It was entirely unnatural, and a mere novelty of scholastic wit, to want to take an idea contrived quite arbitrarily and extract from it the exis­ tence of the corresponding object itself. In fact one would never have tried this path if it had not been preceded by a need of our reason to as­ sume for existence in general a basis in something necessary (with which one could stop the ascent), and if -since this necessity has to be unconditioned and certain priori -reason were not compelled to seek a a concept that, if possible, was sufficient to meet this demand by pro­ viding an existence that is supposed to be cognized fully priori. It was a believed that this had been found in the idea of a most real being, and this was therefore used only to provide more determinate acquaintance with something of which one was already convinced or persuaded on other grounds that it must exist, namely, the necessary being. Mean­ while this natural course of reason was concealed, and instead of end­ ing with this concept one sought to begin with it in order to derive the necessity of the existence from it, which, however, this concept was fit only to augment.a From this arose the unfortunate ontological proof, A604/B632 which brings no satisfaction either to the natural and healthy understanding or to scholastically correct examination.
 
 The cosmological proof, which we will now investigate, retains the connection of absolute necessity with the highest reality, but instead of inferring as in the previous argument from the highest reality to neces­ sity of existence, it rather infers from the previously given uncondia ••• d ie er doch nur zu erganzen bestimmt war.
