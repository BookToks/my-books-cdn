The Critique of Pure Reason was the work in which Kant attempted to lay the foundations both for the certainty of modern science and for the possibility of human freedom.
 
 The book is complex, however, not just because of the complexity of Kant's own position, but also because he argues on several fronts against several different alternative positions represented in early modern phi­ losophy generally and within the German Enlightenment in particular.
 
 In order to make room for his own dualistic defense of both modern sci­ ence and human autonomy, Kant, like Descartes, Locke, and Hume, felt he had to rein in the pretensions of traditional metaphysics, which was represented for him by the school of Christian Wolff (r679-1754) and his followers, especially Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714-1762).2 Their position, which Kant called "dogmatism," was compared in the Preface to the Critique to the despotic ministry of an absolute monar­ chy -Kant held dogmatism to be capricious, opinionated, faction­ ridden and consequently unstable and open to the contempt of rational observers.
 
 Yet Kant wanted to distinguish his own critical stance toward dogma­ Y.!'m from several other ways of rejecting it, which he regarded as them­ selves equally dangerous to the cause of reason. The first of these is I r skepticism, the position Kant took David Hume (r 7 II -r 776) to advo­ cate) Another position Kant rejected was em- piricistn, which understood the "way of ideas" described in John Locke's (1632-17°4) Essay concern­ ing Human Understanding (1790) as grounding knowledge solely on ideas acquired in the course of individual experience. Yet another philo­ sophical stance Kant encountered was what he called indifefren tism, which did not reject metaphysical assertions themselves but did reject any attempt to argue for them systematically and rigorously. Here he had in mind a number of popular philosophers who were often in sub­ stantive agreement with dogmatists on metaphysical issues such as the existence of God and the immortality of the soul, but who were uncon­ vinced by the scholastic subtlety of the dogmatists' propositions and proofs, holding instead that the beliefs on these matters that we need for the successful conduct of human life are simply given through "healthy understanding" or common sense.4 Yet while he attempted to criticize and limit the scope of traditional metaphysics, Kant also sought to defend against empiricists its underly­ ing claim of the possibility of universal and necessary knowledge -what Kant called a priori knowledge, knowledge originating independently of experience, because no knowledge derived from any particular experi­ ence, or a posteriori knowledge, could justify a claim to universal and 2 Introduction necessary validity.
