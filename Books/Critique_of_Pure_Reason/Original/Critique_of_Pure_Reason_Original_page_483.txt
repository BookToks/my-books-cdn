Proof For if one assumes that the world has no beginning in time, then up to every given point in time an eternity has elapsed, and hence an infinite series of states of things in the world, each following another, has passed away. But now the infinity of a series consists precisely in the fact that it can never be completed through a successive synthesis. Therefore an infinitely elapsed world-series is impossible, so a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of its existence; which was the first point to be proved.55 Regarding the second point, again assume the opposite: then the world would be an infinite given whole of simultaneously existing things. Now we can think of the magnitude of a quantuma that is not A428/ B 456 given as within certain boundaries of every intuition * in no other way than by the synthesis of its parts, and we can think of the totality of such a quantumb only through the completed synthesis, or through the re­ peated addition of units to each other.t Accordingly, in order to think A426/ B454 * We can intuit an indeterminate quantum as a whole, if it is enclosed within boundaries, without needing to construct its totality through measurement, A42 8 / B 456 i.e., through the successive synthesis of its parts. For the boundaries already determine its completeness by cutting off anything further.
 
 t The concept of a totality is in this case nothing other than the representation of the completed synthesis of its parts, because, since we cannot draw the con­ cept from an intuition of the whole (which is impossible in this case), we can grasp it, at least in the idea, only through the synthesis of the parts up to their completion in the infinite .
 
 • Kant prints the word in German type but declines it in the Latin genitive: Quanti.
 
 Again, the genitive Quanti is used.
