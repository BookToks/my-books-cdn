Presumably, therefore, they have their good and purposive vo足 cation in regard to the natural predisposition of our reason. But as usual the mob of sophists makes a hue and cry over absurdities and contra足 dictions and rails at the regime whose inmost plans they are unable to penetrate, although they too have its benevolent influences to thank for their preservation and even for the culture which puts them in a posi足 tion to blame and condemn.
 
 One cannot avail oneself of a concept a priori with any security unless one has brought about a transcendental deduction of it. The ideas of reason, of course, do not permit any deduction of the same kind as the categories; but if they are to have the least objective validity, even if it is only an indeterminate one, and are not to represent merely empty thought-entities (entia rationis ratiocinantis),a then a deduction of them A67o/B698 must definitely be possible, granted that it must also diverge quite far from the deduction one can carry out in the case of the categories. That deduction is the completion of the critical business of pure reason, and it is what we will now undertake.
 
 It makes a big difference whether something is given to my reason as an object absolutely or is given only as an object in the idea. In the first case my concepts go as far as determining the object; but in the sec足 ond, there is really only a schema for which no object is given, not even hypothetically, but which serves only to represent other objects to us, in accordance with their systematic unity, by means of the relation to this idea, hence to represent these objects indirectly. Thus I say the concept of a highest intelligence is a mere idea, i.e., its objective reality is not to consist in the fact that it relates straightway to an object (for in such a signification we would not be able to justify its objective validity); rather, it is only a schema, ordered in accordance with the conditions of the greatest unity of reason, for the concept of a thing in general, which a Gedankenwesen; beings of sophistical reason 605 Doctrine of Elements.
