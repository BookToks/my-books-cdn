Here’s a simple way to understand the idea:

Everything we see or experience has two parts. One part stays the same all the time, and the other part can change. The part that stays the same is called the substance, and the part that changes is just how the substance shows itself at different times.

When things change, the substance itself doesn’t disappear or get bigger. It just stays there while the way it looks or acts changes.

Kant said that change only happens because something moves. So, when something changes, it’s really just moving or changing its position.

We notice change because the substance stays the same while the way it looks changes. Time helps us see this difference because time divides moments, but something must exist through all those moments.

Substance is like the base that stays there, and the changes are just different ways that base exists or shows up.

This idea mainly applies to things we can see and touch in space. In space, all change is about moving around. If things weren’t moving, they would have to disappear all at once, which never happens.

Even if we take away all the changing parts, the substance itself is sort of empty. What stays is the size or amount of something, which we can measure by how much space it takes up.

So, the important part is that change happens, but something always stays the same underneath it all.
