Critique of all speculative theology

The second mistake comes from misunderstanding the idea of systematic unity. This idea should only help us look for unity by combining things according to the natural laws we observe. When we find something like this in the real world, we can believe we are getting close to understanding it fully, even though we never will completely.

But some people do the opposite. They start by assuming there is a highest intelligence or purpose behind everything. Since this idea is hard to understand, they imagine it like a human and force their ideas of purpose onto nature instead of looking for them through real scientific investigation. Teleology, which should help explain nature’s unity based on natural laws, ends up ruining it and stops reason from doing its job, which is to prove if such a supreme intelligence exists by studying nature.

If we can’t assume that nature has a highest purpose built into it from the start, then how can we try to find it by looking at smaller purposes? The rule says we should assume nature’s unity both from experience and from the essence of things, even if we don’t know exactly what that means yet. But if we start by assuming there is a highest being controlling everything, then nature’s unity becomes something outside and random, not connected to the laws of nature. This causes a problem where we try to prove something by already assuming it is true.

Treating the idea of nature’s unity as a real cause, instead of just a helpful idea for reason, only confuses us. Studying nature should follow natural causes and laws by themselves. We can think there might be a creator, but we shouldn’t force that idea to explain the purpose we see everywhere.
