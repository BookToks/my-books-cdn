Our mind has the power to know things and create experiences using two very different parts. One part is the information we get from our senses, like what we see or hear. The other part is the way our mind organizes that information using pure thinking and imagination, which helps us form ideas.

Tracing how our mind goes from seeing individual things to understanding big ideas is really useful. A famous thinker named Locke helped start this idea. But figuring out pure ideas that come before any experience can’t be done this way. These pure ideas don’t come from experience at all, so we need a different way to explain where they come from. Trying to explain pure ideas by looking at how our body works is not a real explanation. The only proper way to explain these pure ideas is through something called a “transcendental deduction,” which is different from explanations based on experience.

Even if we agree that the transcendental way is the only way to explain pure ideas, it’s not obvious that we absolutely need to do this. For example, we can understand space and time through this method, and we know they are true before experience. But geometry works just fine with pure ideas about space without needing philosophy to prove where these ideas came from. Geometry deals with the outside world, which we sense, and space is how we understand that world. So, geometry’s ideas are clear because they come from how we intuitively see space.

However, pure ideas of understanding, like certain concepts that don’t come from sensing the world, need a transcendental explanation. These ideas relate to objects in a general way without using our senses. Since they don’t come from experience or any sensory images, we must search for a special kind of explanation — the transcendental deduction — for these pure ideas and also for space when used in this way.
