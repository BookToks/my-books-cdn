All the knowledge we get starts from our senses, then moves to understanding, and finally reaches reason. Reason is the highest part of our mind that works with what we sense and helps us think about everything as a whole. Now, I’m trying to explain what this top part of our thinking—reason—is, but it’s a bit tricky.

Like understanding, reason can be used in two ways. One way is just logical, where reason works without caring about the actual information. The other way is real, because reason creates some ideas and rules that don’t come from what we see or understand directly. Logicians have already said that understanding helps us make guesses step by step, but this doesn’t explain how reason makes new ideas on its own. Since reason has both a logical side and a deeper, more creative side, we need a bigger idea that includes both parts. By looking at how understanding works, we can guess that the logical part of reason will help us understand the deeper part too, and the way understanding works will show us how reason’s ideas are connected.

The word “principle” can mean different things, and usually it means an idea we can use as a rule, even if the idea itself isn’t the main source of the rule. Every general statement, even if it’s...
