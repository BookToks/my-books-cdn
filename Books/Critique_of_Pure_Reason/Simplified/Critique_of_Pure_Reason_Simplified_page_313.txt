All things we see happen in time. Time is like a background that stays the same while things happen one after another or at the same time. Time itself doesn’t change because it’s what makes it possible to have things happen in order or together.

We can’t actually see or sense time by itself. Instead, we notice time through the things we see and experience. These things show us time because they happen in a certain order or at the same time. But behind all these things that change, there is something that stays the same. This “something” is called substance. It’s the real part of things that doesn’t change even when everything else does.

Because this substance doesn’t change, it can’t get bigger or smaller. When we notice many things happening, we see them one after the other, not all at once. So, just from what we see, we can’t tell if things are happening at the same time or one by one unless there is something that always stays the same to compare them to.

Only in something that stays the same can we understand time. Time is about things lasting and how events happen in order or together. Change doesn’t affect time itself; it only affects the things happening in time. If we said time itself changes or happens in order, we’d have to imagine another time to explain that, which doesn’t make sense.

Also, noticing that something lasts a long time isn’t just about seeing things happen in order. It’s more than that—it’s about understanding that there is something constant behind all the changes.
