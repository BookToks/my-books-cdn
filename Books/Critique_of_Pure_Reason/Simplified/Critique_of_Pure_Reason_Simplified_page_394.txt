Understanding sets limits on what we can sense, but it doesn’t make its own area bigger. It warns our senses not to try to reach things as they really are, but only to notice how they appear to us. It thinks about an object in itself, but only as a special kind of object that causes appearances. This object isn’t an appearance itself and can’t be understood as size, reality, or substance, because these ideas always need something we can sense to explain them.

We don’t know if this object is inside us or outside us, or if it would disappear if we stopped sensing things. If we want to call this object a “noumenon” because we can’t sense it, that’s okay. But since we can’t use our usual ideas to understand it, this idea doesn’t really help us. It just shows where the limits of what we can sense are and leaves a gap that we can’t fill with experience or pure thought.

So, studying pure understanding doesn’t let us make up new kinds of objects beyond what we can sense. It stops us from imagining hidden worlds or even just the idea of them. The main mistake people make is trying to use understanding in the wrong way, by making objects fit their ideas instead of making ideas fit the objects we can actually sense. This happens because thinking comes before we organize what we sense. We think about something in general, and sometimes we describe it with our senses, but we also separate the idea of the object from how we sense it. This leaves us with a way of thinking that has no real content but still feels like it means something.
