The understanding accordingly bounds sensibility without thereby expanding its own field, and in warning sensibility not to presume to reach for things in themselves but solely for appearances it thinks of an object in itself, but only as a transcendental object,a which is the caus� of appearance (thus not itself appearance), and that cannot be thought of either as magnitude or as reality or as substance, etc. (since these con­ cepts always require sensible forms in which they determine an object); it therefore remains completely unknown whether such an object is to be encountered within or without us, whether it would be canceled out along with sensibility or whether it would remain even if we took sensibility away. If we want to call this objectb a noumenonC because the B 345 representation of it is nothing sensible, we are free to do so. But since we caimot apply any of our concepts of the understanding to it, this rep­ resentation still remains empty for us, and serves for nothing but to designate the boundaries of our sensible cognition and leave open a space A289 that we can fill up neither through possible experience nor through the pure understanding.
 
 The critique of this pure understanding thus does not allow us to create a new field of objects beyond those that can come before it as ap­ pearances, and to indulge in intelligible worlds, or even in the concept I of them. The mistake that most obviously leads to this, and can certainly be excused though not justified, lies in this: that the use of the un­ derstanding, contrary to its vocation, d is made transcendental, and the objects, i.e., possible intuitions, are made to conform themselves to concepts, but concepts are not made to conform themselves to possible intuitions (on which alone rests their objective validity). The cause of this, however, is in turn that apperception and, with it, thinking precede all possible determination of the arrangement of representations. We therefore think something in general, and on the one side determine it sensibly, only we also distinguish the object represented in general and B 346 in abstracto from this way of intuiting it; thus there remains to us a way of determining it merely through thinking that is, to be sure, a merely logical form without content, but that nevertheless seems to us to be a a Object Object b , Not in roman type.
