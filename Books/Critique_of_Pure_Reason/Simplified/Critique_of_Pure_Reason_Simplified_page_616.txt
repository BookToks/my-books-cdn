When we think about complicated ideas, we don’t always understand the object itself directly. Instead, we follow certain rules or principles that help us use our understanding in a clear and organized way.

These rules make sure that when we experience something, our understanding stays consistent and connected, even if they don’t tell us exactly what the object is like. They just guide how we should think about our experiences to keep everything making sense.

Some rules come from what we want to know or improve about the object, not from the object itself. These are called maxims of reason. For example, there are maxims that come from what reason hopes to achieve, even if they don’t seem like real facts.

If we treat these guiding rules as actual facts, they can seem to clash with each other. But if we see them as maxims, then the “conflict” is just because reason has different interests or goals. Reason really wants just one thing, and these different maxims are just different ways of trying to reach that goal.

For example, some people might focus more on details and variety, while others prefer unity and simplicity. Each person thinks their way is right because they are more attached to one of these ideas. But neither is based on solid facts; they are just different maxims based on what reason wants.
