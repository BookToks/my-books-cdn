The Transcendental Doctrine of Elements is divided into parts. 

Part I is called the Transcendental Aesthetic. It has two sections: one about Space and one about Time.

Part II is called the Transcendental Logic. It has two divisions. The first division is the Transcendental Analytic, which has two books with many chapters and sections. The second division is the Transcendental Dialectic, also with two books and many chapters and sections.

There is also the Transcendental Doctrine of Method. It has four chapters: The Discipline of Pure Reason, The Canon of Pure Reason, The Architectonic of Pure Reason, and The History of Pure Reason.

Kant included this table of contents only in the first edition.
