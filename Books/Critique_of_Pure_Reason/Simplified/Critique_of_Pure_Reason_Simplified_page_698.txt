If something is true for everyone just because they use reason, then it has a strong, objective basis, and believing it is called conviction. But if it only feels true because of how a person is made or thinks, then it’s called persuasion. Persuasion is just how something seems to us, since the reason for believing it comes only from inside ourselves. That means persuasion is only true for that one person and can’t be shared with others.

Truth, on the other hand, is based on how things really are, and everyone’s understanding should agree about it. The way to tell if believing something is conviction or just persuasion is by seeing if you can explain it to others and if they agree with it too. If they do, it shows that the reason for believing it is connected to the actual thing, proving the belief is true.

Sometimes, you can’t tell the difference between persuasion and conviction just by how you feel. But if you try to see if others agree with your reasons, you might find out your belief is just personal persuasion, not true conviction. This test doesn’t create conviction but shows when a belief is only true for you.

Also, if you can explain why you believe something based on your own mind and not because of the real object, then you’ve found an illusion. Knowing this helps you stop being fooled, although it’s still easy to be tricked if your nature makes you believe it.

I can only say something is definitely true for everyone if it causes conviction. I can keep my own personal beliefs (persuasion) if I want, but I shouldn’t try to say those beliefs are true for everyone else.
