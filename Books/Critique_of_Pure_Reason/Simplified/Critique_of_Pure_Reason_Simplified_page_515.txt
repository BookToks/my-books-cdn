Sometimes people talk a lot about ideas they don’t really understand, and that’s why they can sound so confident. But when it comes to studying nature, they usually have to admit they don’t know everything.

Feeling comfortable and proud of what you believe makes these ideas popular. Even though philosophers find it hard to accept something without proof, most people just want a starting point they can trust. They don’t worry about fully understanding it because they’re used to it from hearing it many times.

For most people, practical concerns are more important than deep thinking. They believe they understand things if it fits what they want or expect. Because of this, ideas like empiricism don’t become very popular outside of schools, and most people don’t take them seriously.

Human reason naturally wants to fit all knowledge into a system, where everything connects. It only accepts ideas that can work together. But some ideas say there’s no first cause or starting point, and everything is always caused by something else. This makes it impossible to build a complete system of knowledge. So, reason prefers ideas that allow a solid foundation to be built.

If someone could ignore all their personal interests and just look at the facts, they might get stuck not knowing which side to choose, always unsure and changing their mind.
