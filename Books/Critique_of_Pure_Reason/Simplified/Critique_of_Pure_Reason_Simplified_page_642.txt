It might seem weird that reason, which is supposed to guide everything else, would need rules for itself. But reason has avoided this problem before because it looks so serious and important that no one thought it was messing around with ideas instead of real things.

We didn’t need to check reason when it’s used with real-life experience because its ideas are tested all the time by what actually happens. We also didn’t need to check it in math because math ideas show clearly in our minds, so any mistakes are easy to spot.

But when reason is used in a way that doesn’t rely on experience or clear mental pictures—like when it tries to work just with ideas—it really needs rules to stop it from going too far and making mistakes. That’s why the whole study of pure reason is focused on controlling it. If there are individual mistakes, they can be fixed by pointing them out and understanding why they happened. But sometimes, reason creates a whole system of wrong ideas that are connected, and for that, we need special rules—a kind of strict self-checking system that stops false ideas from sneaking in.

It’s important to say that in this part of the study, I’m not telling pure reason what to think, but how to think properly. The content was already covered earlier. Because using reason is similar in many situations, we need to be careful about how we talk about fixing mistakes versus teaching new ideas. The word “correction” should only be used to mean fixing errors, not teaching.
