If the thing we’re watching and the person watching it are moving at the same speed in the same direction, it looks like nothing is moving. We see the stars and planets moving from Earth. So, if we say the Earth is moving, everything outside the Earth would seem to move the opposite way, like everything is passing by us.

This is especially true for the daily movement we see in the sky. It looks like the whole universe is moving around Earth, even though Earth itself isn’t seen as moving. Since the sky holds everything, it’s not clear why we should say the sky is moving instead of the Earth.

Kant said metaphysics, which is the study of big ideas about existence, is mostly useful for practical life, not just for theory. He compared metaphysics to a police force that keeps our morals and religion safe. Sometimes he also compared it to medicine. Kant worked a lot on these ideas and tried to explain them better over many years.

Kant also talked about experience as “perception with rules” or “when what we see matches what we know about an object.” These ideas might sound different but actually mean the same thing once you think about knowledge following rules.

He believed that the difference between what we know before experience (a priori) and what we learn from experience (a posteriori) is the most basic idea in philosophy. This idea comes before other distinctions, like between things we can sense and things we can only understand with our minds.
