It would be really bragging to call yourself a philosopher like the perfect idea of one, which only exists in theory.

Mathematicians, scientists, and logicians are like artists of thinking, no matter how smart they are or how much they’ve learned about philosophy. There is still an ideal teacher who guides them all and uses their skills to reach the main goals of human reason. Only that person deserves to be called a philosopher. But since this perfect philosopher doesn’t actually exist yet, even though the idea of them is in everyone’s mind, we will focus on what philosophy tells us about bringing everything together based on big goals.

These big goals aren’t the highest ones, because in the full system of reason, there can only be one highest goal.

So, these goals are either the final goal or smaller goals that are needed to reach the final one. The final goal is basically the whole purpose of being human, and the philosophy about it is called moral philosophy. Because moral philosophy was so important, the ancient thinkers mainly called the moralist a philosopher. Even today, if someone shows self-control and uses reason, we might still call them a philosopher, even if they don’t know everything.

Philosophy has two main parts: one about nature and one about freedom. This means it includes natural law and moral law, at first as two separate systems but eventually combined into one system. Philosophy about nature is about everything that exists, and moral philosophy is about what should happen.

All philosophy is either knowledge from pure reason or knowledge based on experience. The first is called pure philosophy, and the second is called empirical philosophy.

A cosmopolitan concept means it’s about something that matters to everyone. So, I decide the goal of a science based on old ideas if it’s only seen as a skill for certain random goals.
