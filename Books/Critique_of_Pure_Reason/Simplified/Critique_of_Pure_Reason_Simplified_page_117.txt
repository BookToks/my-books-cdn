The Abbe Terrasson says that if we measure a book’s size by how long it takes to understand it, then many books would actually be shorter if they weren’t so short. But on the other hand, if we look at a big and connected idea, we could also say that many books would be clearer if they weren’t made so clear. This is because making parts very clear can sometimes confuse the whole, since the reader can’t see the big picture quickly enough. All the extra details can cover up the main structure, which is the most important part when judging if the system is good and makes sense.

I think it can really motivate the reader to work with the author when they see they’re doing something big and important, and doing it fully and forever. Metaphysics, as we explain it here, is the only science where a small but focused effort can finish the work soon. After that, people only need to teach it in different ways, but they can’t add anything new to its content. This is because it’s just a full list of what we know through pure reason, organized in order. Nothing can be missed, since what reason creates by itself can’t stay hidden. It comes out as soon as we find reason’s main rule.

The perfect unity of this knowledge, and the fact that it comes only from pure ideas without experience or particular examples, makes this complete understanding not only possible but necessary. I hope to give such a system of pure reason in a book called Metaphysics of Nature, which will be shorter but much richer in content than this critique. This critique had to explain where the ideas come from and the conditions that make it possible, clearing a path that was very overgrown before.
