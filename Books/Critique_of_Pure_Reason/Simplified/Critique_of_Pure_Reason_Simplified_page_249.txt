Nature follows certain rules that are necessary, and this connection is called transcendental affinity. The regular connection we see in the world is just a result of this deeper connection.

It might sound weird to say that nature depends on how our mind understands things. But if you think about it, nature is just a collection of what we see and experience, not something that exists by itself. So, the unity that makes nature an object we can experience comes from our mind’s ability to understand things. Because of this, we can know this unity before we even experience anything. If nature existed completely on its own, without our mind’s input, we wouldn’t be able to explain how we understand it as a connected whole. We would only get random connections from experience, not the necessary ones we expect.

Now, about how our understanding relates to objects and how we can know them before experience.

What we talked about before separately, we will now explain together. To have any experience and know its objects, we rely on three parts of our mind: sense, imagination, and apperception. We can think about each of these based on what we experience, but also as basic parts of how experience is even possible. Sense gives us the raw data of what we see, imagination helps us connect and remember things, and apperception is our awareness that the things we imagine match what we actually experienced.

Pure intuition, like our sense of time inside our mind, helps us organize everything we perceive before we even experience it. The pure way our imagination works helps us connect ideas before experience. And pure apperception is our basic self-awareness that recognizes these connections.
