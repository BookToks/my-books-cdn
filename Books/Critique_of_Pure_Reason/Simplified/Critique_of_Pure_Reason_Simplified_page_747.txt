A. Pickard-Cambridge, in The Complete Works of Aristotle, edited by Jonathan Barnes, says that the main goal of the Topics is to study a type of argument called the dialectical syllogism. W. D. Ross explains that this kind of argument is different from scientific ones because its starting points are not definitely true but just probably true. These premises are ideas that most people, or at least wise people, agree with. Kant seems to think the Topics were used to make arguments that look convincing because of how they are set up, even if their starting points might not actually be believable.

Kant is probably thinking about Locke’s idea that all our ideas come from two sources: sensation and reflection. Locke wrote this in his book Essay Concerning Human Understanding. But Kant seems to misunderstand Locke by thinking that reflection only means thinking about ideas we get from our senses. Actually, Locke said we can also get simple ideas by reflecting on how our own mind works. This idea is a bit like Kant’s idea that the mind’s own rules shape how we understand things, adding to what we learn from our senses. However, Locke didn’t explore this much or realize that math and logic could teach us about how the mind works.

Kant also talks about Leibniz’s idea that everything’s qualities are positive and make it deserve to exist. The things that really exist are the ones with the most positive qualities, making the world as perfect as possible. According to this, there are no truly negative qualities, just limits on the positive ones. Kant had been debating this idea since his essay on Negative Magnitudes.

Kant mentions Leibniz’s update of Descartes’s ontological argument. Leibniz said the argument works if you first prove that the idea of God doesn’t contradict itself. This is easy because the idea of God is of a perfect being with only positive traits that don’t conflict. Leibniz explained this in his writings, including his Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas.

Kant would also know about many other statements of this idea from Leibniz’s works like A New System of Nature, Principles of Nature and Grace, and Monadology.

For more details, see the Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, especially Leibniz’s Third and Fifth Letters.

Finally, there is a misquote from a poem by Viktor Albrecht von Haller. The correct line says: “No created spirit can penetrate the inner nature.”
