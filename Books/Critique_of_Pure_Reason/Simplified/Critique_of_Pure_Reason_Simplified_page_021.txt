This is Kant’s famous idea called transcendental idealism. He uses it a lot in his book, the Critique of Pure Reason, and the two books that come after it. Sometimes he uses it in a positive way, like in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" and the "Discipline of Pure Reason," to explain how we can know certain things in math before experience. Other times, he uses it in a negative way, like in the "Transcendental Dialectic," to show that our knowledge is limited to what we can sense, and we can’t really know things as they are by themselves, outside of how our minds understand them.

The "Transcendental Analytic" is part of the book that talks about the deep ideas behind how we understand things. It is the longest and most detailed part of the Critique. It has two main sections: the "Transcendental Analytic," which tries to build up how understanding works by giving us certain basic ideas that we use to think before experience, and the "Transcendental Dialectic," which mainly points out mistakes people make when they try to use reason wrongly. But in the end, it also shows how reason can help guide us in asking questions and making decisions.

The "Transcendental Analytic" is split into two parts. The first part, called the "Analytic of Concepts," talks about the basic ideas or concepts we use to understand anything. The second part, called the "Analytic of Principles," explains the rules or principles that come from applying those ideas to what we sense.

In the "Analytic of Concepts," Kant says that our understanding gives us certain basic ideas that come before experience and make any experience possible. These twelve main ideas, which he calls categories, are general ways we think about objects. Together with the basic ways we sense things, these categories help us learn new knowledge that is not just based on experience. In an early section of the "Transcendental Analytic," Kant explains how he gets these twelve categories from twelve basic types of judgments, or ways we say things that can be true or false. His point is that just like all judgments have certain features, there must be certain ways we form ideas about objects so that our judgments actually relate to real things.

There are four main features of judgments: their quantity, which means how much the subject covers; their quality, which means whether the predicate is true or false; their relation, which means whether they connect just one subject and predicate or more; and their modality, which means whether they talk about what is possible, actual, or necessary.
