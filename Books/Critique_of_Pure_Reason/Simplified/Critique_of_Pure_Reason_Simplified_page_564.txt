We have seen above that no objects at all can be represented through pure concepts of the understanding without any conditions of sensi­ bility, because the conditions for the objective reality of these concepts are lacking, and nothing is encountered in them except the pure form of thinking. Nevertheless they can be exhibited in concreto if one applies them to appearances; for in the latter they have the proper material for a concept of experience, which is nothing but a concept of the under­ standing in concreto. Ideas, however, are still more remote from objec­ tive reality than categories; for no appearance can be found in which they may be represented in concreto. They contain a certain completeness that no possible empirical cognition ever achieves, and with them A 568 / B 596 reason has a systematic unity only in the sense that the empirically possible unity seeks to approach it without ever completely reaching it.
 
 But something that seems to be even further removed from objective reality than the idea is what I call the ideal, by which I understand the idea not merely in concreto but in individuo, i.e., as an individual thing which is determinable, or even determined, through the idea alone.
 
 Humanity in its entire perfection contains not only the extension of all those properties belonging essentially to this nature and constituting our concept of it to the point of complete congruence with its ends, which would be our idea of perfect humanity, but also everything be­ sides this concept that belongs to the thoroughgoing determination of the idea; for out of each [pair of] opposed predicates only a single one can be suited to the idea of the perfect human being. What is an ideal to us, was to Plato an idea in the divine understanding,86 an individ­ ual object in that understanding's pure intuition, the most perfect thing of each species of possible beings and the original ground of all its copies in appearance.
