We have already seen that pure ideas by themselves can’t show us real things without any help from our senses. This is because these ideas don’t have the real stuff needed to connect to actual things. They only show the way we think about things, not the things themselves. But if we use these ideas with what we see or experience, then they can help us understand real things. This is because what we see gives the ideas something real to work with. Ideas are even less connected to real things than simple categories because there is no way to find them in what we experience. Ideas are more complete than anything we can actually know, and reason tries to get close to them but never fully reaches them.

But there’s something that seems even less connected to reality than an idea, which I call the ideal. This means the idea not just as a general thing but as one exact, individual thing that is defined only by that idea.

For example, the perfect human includes not just every important quality we think makes a human but also everything else that completely fits the idea of a perfect person. From every pair of opposite qualities, only one fits the perfect human. What we call an ideal was, for Plato, a perfect idea in a divine mind, an individual thing seen perfectly in that mind, the best example of each kind of being, and the original source of all copies we see in the world.
