We can only understand our own mind by looking inside ourselves, using our inner feelings. This is important because it helps explain where our ability to sense things comes from.

How our mind connects to objects and why everything seems joined together is something too deep for us to fully understand. We only know ourselves through inner feelings, which are like appearances. So, if we try to study things beyond these appearances, we can only find more appearances, even if we want to find their deeper causes.

The main point of this idea is to show that guessing about objects just by comparing thoughts in our mind doesn’t work. But it also reminds us that even though appearances aren’t the real things themselves, they are the only way our mind can understand real things, because our feelings match up with our ideas.

When we think logically, we just compare ideas to see if they are the same, if they contradict, or if one idea adds something to another. We also decide which ideas come from real things and which ones are just ways of thinking about those things. But if we try to apply these ideas to any object in general, without saying if it’s something we feel or just imagine, problems come up. These problems show that the idea of an object without any real feeling or experience is not just incomplete but actually doesn’t make sense. So, we either have to think only about ideas without objects or accept that objects need to be connected to something we can feel. Imagining things without feeling them would need a special kind of feeling we don’t have. But even feelings don’t show things as they really are. If I think about things in general, differences in how they relate to each other don’t mean the things themselves are different. If the idea of one thing is not different from another inside, then I’m just thinking of the same thing in different ways.
