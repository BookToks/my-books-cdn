Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter I talks about experience. For now, I can still use these ideas when thinking about how we actually experience things. This is because they help explain how we understand freedom and free will, even though these ideas are about logic, like how subjects and predicates relate or how causes and effects work.

Actions or results follow certain rules that match the laws of nature and ideas about substances and causes. But these actions come from a completely different starting point.

I said this to avoid confusion about the idea that we only know ourselves as things that appear to us. Later on, I will explain this more.

In the next part, I will talk about how pure reason can trick us with false ideas. These mistakes happen because of certain logical patterns called syllogisms. Just like categories follow logical rules, these errors follow certain logical forms too.
