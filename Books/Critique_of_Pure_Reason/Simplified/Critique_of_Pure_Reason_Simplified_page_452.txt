When someone talks about the state of being alive, they can’t say for sure that everything we see or even our own thinking will stop after death.

So, all arguments about what our mind really is and how it connects to our physical body come from people guessing about things they don’t really know. They mistake their thoughts for real things and get confused. This creates a fake kind of knowledge where people either think they know stuff about things no one really understands or they treat their ideas as if they were real objects. This leads to endless confusion and arguments.

The only way to get free from these wrong ideas is by carefully and fairly checking what we can really know. This doesn’t mean making fun of failed attempts or feeling sad about what we can’t understand, but by clearly defining the limits of what reason can do based on solid rules. Reason can only explore as far as our experience allows, like sailing along a coast. If we go beyond that, we enter a vast, endless ocean full of false hopes and confusion, which makes us give up in the end.

We still need to explain clearly the common mistake reason makes when it thinks it knows more than it actually does, especially in how we think about ourselves. We’ve waited until now to do this to avoid making things unclear or jumping ahead too fast. Now, we want to explain it properly.

All these mistakes happen because people confuse their own way of thinking with real knowledge about things. We have already said that pure reason deals with the whole set of conditions for something that depends on other things. Since these mistakes aren’t about specific experiences but about universal thinking, they come from how we use reason in three main ways.
