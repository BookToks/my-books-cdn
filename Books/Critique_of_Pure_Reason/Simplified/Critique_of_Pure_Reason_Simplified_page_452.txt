On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> state (in life), hence he also cannot claim to know that the condition of all outer intuition, or even of the thinking subject itself, will cease after A 395 this state (after death).
 
 Thus every dispute about the nature of our thinking being and its conjunction with the corporeal world is merely a consequence of the fact that one fills the gaps regarding what one does not know with par­ alogisms of reason, making thoughts into things and hypostatizing them; from this arises an imagined science, both in regard to affirma­ tive and negative assertions, in that everyone either presumes to know something about objects about which no human being has any concept, or else makes his own representations into objects, and thus goes round and round in an eternal circle of ambiguities and contradictions.
 
 Nothing but the sobriety of a strict but just criticism can liberate us from these dogmatic semblances, which through imagined happiness hold so many subject to theories and systems, and limit all our specula­ tive claims merely to the field of possible experience, not by stale mock­ ery at attempts that have so often failed, or by pious sighing over the limits of our reason, but by means of a complete determination of rea­ son's boundaries according to secure principles, which with the greatest reliability fastens its nihil ulteriusa on those Pillars of Hercules37 that nature has erected, so that the voyage of our reason may proceed only as far as the continuous coastline of experience reaches, a coastline that A 396 we cannot leave without venturing out into a shoreless ocean, which, among always deceptive prospects, forces us in the end to abandon as hopeless all our troublesome and tedious efforts.
 
 * * * We still owe a distinct and general exposition of the transcendental and yet natural illusion in the paralogisms of pure reason, and also of a justification of their systematic ordering, running parallel to the table of categories. We could not have undertaken it at the beginning of this section without the danger of falling into obscurity or clumsily getting ahead of ourselves. Now we want to try to fulfill this obligation.
 
 One can place all illusion in the taking of a subjective condition of thinking for the cognition of an object.b In the Introduction to the Transcendental Dialectic we have further shown that pure reason con­ cerns itself solely with totality in the synthesis of conditions for a given conditioned. Since now the dialectical illusion of pure reason cannot be any empirical illusion occurring along with determinate empirical cog­ nitions, it must have to do with the universal conditions of thinking; and there are only three cases of the dialectical use of pure reason: A397 a nothing farther Objects b 439 Doctrine of Elements.
