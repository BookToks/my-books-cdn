There are two ways people think about God or a highest being. One way is called transcendental theology, which means we understand God only through ideas we get from thinking, not from nature. People who believe only this way are called deists. They think we can know there is a first cause or original being just by using reason, but we can’t really say much more about it. The other way is called natural theology. These people, called theists, believe we can learn more about God by looking at nature, like our soul, and understand God as a being who is smart and free. Deists see this being just as the cause of the world, but theists see it as the creator who made everything on purpose.

Transcendental theology breaks down into two types. One, called cosmotheology, tries to figure out that original being from general experience but doesn’t say much about the world itself. The other, called ontotheology, thinks we can know about this being just from ideas, without any experience at all.

Natural theology looks at the world’s order, unity, and how things work to guess what the creator is like. It says there must be two kinds of causes: nature and freedom. From this, it believes the highest being is either the source of all natural order (called physico-theology) or the source of all moral order and perfection (called moral theology).

Usually, when people talk about God, they don’t mean some automatic force of nature but a highest being who creates through understanding and free will. Because of this, some might say deists don’t really believe in God, only in a first cause. But since no one should be accused of disbelief just for being unsure, we don’t blame them for not fully accepting the idea of God.
