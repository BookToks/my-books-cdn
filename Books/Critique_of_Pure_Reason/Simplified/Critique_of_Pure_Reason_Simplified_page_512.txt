When it comes to reason in these debates, it’s not hard to understand the idea that every combination or solution has a starting point that doesn’t depend on anything else. Reason is more used to looking down at the results than trying to find the original cause. It feels comfortable thinking there’s something absolutely first, even if it doesn’t worry about whether that’s really possible. This gives reason a solid place to hold onto, because without it, it would always be stuck in the middle and never enjoy the challenge of moving from what depends on something else to what causes it.

On the other hand, when looking at the world using experience and observation, there isn’t the same strong interest that ideas like morality and religion bring.

Pure experience seems to take away the power from those ideas. If there’s no original being outside the world, if the world never began and has no creator, if our will isn’t free and our soul is like matter (breakable and corruptible), then moral ideas lose their meaning. They fall apart along with the big ideas that support them.

But experience does help reason in other ways. It gives reason a strong, clear base: the world we can observe and the laws we can find through experience. Reason can keep learning and understanding by studying what we can see and test. It can imagine things clearly and connect ideas to real experiences. Reason doesn’t need to leave this natural order to guess about things it can’t experience. It’s not allowed to stop looking for real proof and start making up ideas that can’t be tested or seen, thinking it’s above facts and can ignore them.

So, the person who trusts experience won’t say there was a very first moment of nature or a limit to what we can see and learn. They believe knowledge should always be based on what we can observe and understand.
