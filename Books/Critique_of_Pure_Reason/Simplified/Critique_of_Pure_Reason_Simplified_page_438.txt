When we think about pure reason, we see ourselves as something outside. But if I want to watch just the "I" through all the changes in my thoughts, I have no one else to compare it with except myself. So, I can only give answers that repeat what I already think, because I use my idea of myself instead of looking at the real qualities of myself as an object. This means I’m just assuming what I was supposed to find out.

The fourth mistake about how we understand the outside world is this: If something’s existence can only be guessed because it causes what we see, then its existence is uncertain. All outer things are like this—they aren’t seen right away, but only guessed as causes of what we perceive. So, the existence of all outside objects is doubtful. This doubt is called the "ideality" of outer appearances. The idea that these outside objects might be real for sure is called dualism, which is different from idealism.

Now, let’s look closely at this fourth mistake in how we think about the mind. We can say it’s true that we only directly notice what’s inside us, and only my own existence can be simply noticed. So, a real object outside me is never directly seen, but only added as a thought to what I feel inside, as if it causes that feeling. That’s why Descartes said the only sure thing is “I exist as a thinking being.” It’s clear that what’s outside isn’t inside me, so I can’t find it in my awareness or perception, which really just measures my own awareness.

So, I don’t really see outside things; I only guess they exist based on my inner feelings, thinking they cause those feelings. But guessing the cause from an effect is always unsure because more than one cause could have made that effect.
