All thinking happens in our consciousness. Even if our thoughts don’t come from what we sense around us, they still help us tell two types of things apart based on how we picture them in our mind. When I think, I am an object of inner sense, and we call this the "soul." Things we see and sense outside of us are called the "body." So, when I say "I" as someone who thinks, it already points to the soul, which is what psychology studies if it focuses only on what we can figure out about the soul without depending on specific experiences.

The study of the soul, if it’s done purely by reason, tries to do exactly this. If we mix in any part of our personal feelings or experiences, then it stops being a pure study and becomes one based on experience. We can think of this study as a science built on the simple idea "I think," and we can carefully check if this idea really makes sense or not.

Even though I have an inner feeling of thinking "I," which means being aware of myself, this feeling doesn’t make the study less pure. This inner awareness is just the basic "I think" that allows me to understand other ideas like "substance" or "cause." Inner experience, or being aware of our own thoughts, isn’t the same as knowing particular things from experience. It’s a kind of general understanding that makes all experiences possible, and studying how this works is a special kind of philosophy called transcendental philosophy.

The smallest things we might notice, like feeling happy or sad, are examples of specific experiences. But just being aware that we are experiencing something, without focusing on what exactly it is, belongs to the general study of how experience itself is possible.
