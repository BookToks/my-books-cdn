In math, synthetic judgments are things like "The sum of the inside angles of a flat triangle equals two right angles." You figure this out by making a shape that fits the first idea ("flat triangle") using pure imagination, and then you see that the second idea is true too ("equals two right angles"). This gives a clear answer (two right angles add up to 180 degrees, not 179 or 181) because you made a specific shape. But the answer is known before experience (a priori) because it comes from pure imagination, which shapes how all triangles or other shapes can be.

In everyday life, we learn things by watching and experiencing, which gives us synthetic and exact but only accidental or after-the-fact (a posteriori) facts. For example, "My copy of the Critique is worn and dog-eared" tells us something new ("worn and dog-eared") that goes beyond just saying "my copy of the Critique." But this info only applies to that exact book because it doesn’t come from any basic form of how things appear.

But what does Kant mean by his third example, which he talks about in confusing ways like "the sensible condition of a subject" or "the function of thinking in general"?

Kant means something he hinted at earlier, that there are certain rules needed for how our thoughts are arranged and ordered as one self, and how these thoughts fit into space and time where the self places them. These rules add general conditions to the idea of any possible experience, going beyond just the specific details we might notice. He explains that in analytic judgments, the second part belongs to the first idea, but in synthetic judgments, it relates to the actual object, because the second part isn’t already in the first idea. However, an object has conditions for how the idea applies to it, like its specific position in reality. 

All ideas depend on something sensible, so if an idea is sensible but universal, it must be thought of as real (like a triangle drawn out). If the idea isn’t just pure imagination but comes from experience, it includes the condition of where it is in space and time, meaning the way we figure out its exact place.

This is still a bit confusing, but Kant is saying that synthetic judgments that are also universal and known before experience (a priori) can be based on two things: in math, they come from making a mathematical object; in other cases, they come from knowing where one object is in space and time compared to others.

Kant also says he is looking for the basic rules that explain how appearances are shown, meaning how each thought is placed in a clear position inside the combined space and time that hold all the thoughts of a single self.
