In mathe­ matics, synthetic judgments -such as "The sum of the interior angles of a plane triangle equals two right angles" -are made or confirmed by constructing an object satisfying the first predicate ("plane triangle") in pure intuition, and then seeing that the construction satisfies the second predicate as well ("equals two right angles"); such a construction yields a determinate answer (two right angles contain 180 degrees, not 179 or 18 I) because it is the construction of a particular object, but it yields a result that is priori, because it takes place in pure intuition, the form a that determines the structure of all possible triangles or other spatial figures or objects. In ordinary experience, observation establishes syn­ thetic and determinate but only contingent or posteriori propositions a because of the appeal to particular experience: a proposition like "My copy of the Critique is worn and dog-eared" adds information ("worn and dog-eared") that goes beyond the initial description of the object ("my copy of the Critique"), but that additional information can only be asserted of the particular object that is observed, because it has nothing to do with any essential form of appearance. But what does Kant mean by his third case, referred to only by such obscure phrases as "the sen­ sible condition of a subject" or "the function of thinking in general"?
 
 'Vhat Kant has in mind is what he hinted at in 1774, namely that there are certain rules necessary for the "disposition and order" of rep­ resentations conceived of as belonging to a unified self and occupying determinate positions in the space and time in which that self places its representations, and that these rules add general conditions to the con­ cept of any possible object of experience that go beyond the particular features of such objects we may happen to observe and by means of which we may happen to refer to them. He brings together the steps of this argument thus far in this passage: In analytic judgments the predicate [b] pertains properly to the concept in a, synthetic judgments to the object of the concept, since the predicate [b} is not contained in the concept. However, the object that corresponds to a concept has certain conditions for the application of this concept, i.e., its position in con­ creto . . Now the condition of all concepts is sensible; thus, if the concept is also .
 
 sensible, but universal, it must be considered in concreto, e.g., a triangle in its construction. If the concept does not signify pure intuition, but empirical, then contains the condition of the relative position (0) in space and time, i.e., the x condition for universally determining something in them.125 This is still somewhat obscure, but what Kant is saying is that judgments that are synthetic but also genuinely universal, that is, a priori, can be grounded in one of two ways: in the case of mathematics, such judg­ ments are grounded in the construction of a mathematical object; in the other case, such judgments are grounded in the condition of determin­ ing the relative position of one object in space and time to others.
 
 52 Introduction Kant also puts this point by saying that what he is looking for are the principles of the exposition of appearances, where that means precisely the assignment of each representation to a determinate position in the uni­ fied space and time that is the framework for all the representations be­ longing to a unified self.
