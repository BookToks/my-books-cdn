But we should always look for the problem inside ourselves first. When we use deep thinking in its highest form, it involves back-and-forth arguments. The problems we need to worry about come from within us. We have to find these problems, like old unpaid debts, so we can build lasting peace by getting rid of them. Peace on the outside is only an illusion. The root of attacks comes from how human thinking works, and we have to remove it. But how can we remove it if we don’t let it grow and show itself? We need to let it grow so we can see it clearly and then cut it out from the root. So, imagine the problems that no one has thought of yet, and even give your opponent the best tools and the strongest position they could want. There’s nothing to fear in this. Instead, you can hope to find a way to protect yourself forever.

To fully prepare yourself, you also need to include ideas based only on pure thinking. These ideas might be weak because they aren’t tested by experience, but they can still be used by your opponent against you. For example, if you face the problem that the soul is not physical and doesn’t go through body changes, but experience seems to show that our mind’s ups and downs are just changes in our body, you can weaken this idea. You can say that our body is just the way we experience the world now, and all our senses and thinking depend on it for now, while we’re alive. Leaving the body would mean ending the use of our senses and starting true thinking. So, the body doesn’t cause thinking but limits it. It helps with senses and animal life, but it stops pure spiritual life. Just because the body affects senses doesn’t mean it controls our entire life. You can even go further and come up with new doubts or questions that no one has thought about or explored deeply enough.

Another problem is that how we think depends on chance. For humans and animals, thinking depends on opportunity, food, care, moods, and even bad habits. This makes it hard to believe in the idea that a being with a life that started in such random and controllable conditions could last forever. But when we think about how long the whole species lives on earth, this problem isn’t very big.
