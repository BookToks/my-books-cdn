The "Refutation of Idealism" is one of the most important parts Kant added to the second edition. However, even before the new edition was published, Kant was already changing it again in the new preface. This shows he wasn’t fully happy with his new argument. Actually, the new "Refutation" wasn’t the end of his thinking but the start of a new process. There are many versions from 1788-90 that prove Kant kept working on this idea after the second edition came out.

Kant also made big changes to the chapter about the difference between phenomena and noumena. He wanted to explain better the difference between using the idea of a noumenon in a negative way and a positive way. This was a step toward making clearer his idea that pure reason only works negatively in theory but has a positive role in practice. Some people had questioned how clear this was, including the Gottingen review and Garve’s draft.

After adding the new "Refutation of Idealism," Kant had to rewrite the fourth paralogism from the first edition. This part had caused problems because it made people think he believed in Berkeleianism by saying we can be just as sure about things outside us as about our inner thoughts. Kant replaced this with a totally different argument against Descartes. He said there’s no problem with the mind and body interacting because the differences Descartes talked about might just be different ways of seeing the same reality.

Kant didn’t stop there. He rewrote and simplified the whole chapter on paralogisms. Except for the big change in the fourth paralogism, this was the only part where he really improved how he explained things.

After the "Paralogisms of Pure Reason," Kant didn’t make many other big changes for the second edition. We don’t know if that means he was happy with the rest of the book or just ran out of time and patience. Since he kept reworking important ideas in his later works, it seems more likely he just didn’t have time to change more.
