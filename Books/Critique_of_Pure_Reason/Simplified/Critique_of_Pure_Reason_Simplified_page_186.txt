Since the stuff that lets us organize and arrange our feelings can’t itself be a feeling, the material for all appearances is only given to us after we experience it, but its shape or form must already be in our mind before we sense anything. So, this form can be thought about separately from any feelings or sensations.

I call all ideas "pure" (in a special philosophical way) when they don’t come from any feelings. The pure shape of all our sensible experiences is found in the mind before we actually experience anything, where all the different parts of what we see are understood in certain connections. This pure shape of how we sense things is also called pure intuition. 

For example, if I take away from the idea of a body everything that the understanding adds, like substance, force, or divisibility, and also remove what comes from sensation, like hardness, color, or impenetrability, there’s still something left from this experience: extension and form. These belong to pure intuition, which happens before any real object or sensation, just as a form of feeling in the mind.

I call the study of all the rules about how we can sense things before experience the "transcendental aesthetic." So, there must be a science like this, which is the first part of the study of how we understand things, as opposed to the part that studies pure thinking, called transcendental logic.

The word "aesthetics" is mostly used by Germans to mean what others call the study or critique of taste. This comes from a failed hope by the thinker Baumgarten to make the judgment of beauty follow clear, logical rules and become a real science. But this doesn’t work because the supposed rules come from experience and can’t be certain rules that guide how we judge taste. Instead, our sense of taste is what tests if those rules are correct. Because of this, it might be better to stop using the word "aesthetics" for this and keep it for real science, or to share the word between philosophy and psychology, using it sometimes in a strict sense and sometimes in a more general one.
