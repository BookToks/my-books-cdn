We don’t know everything about nature, so some things will always stay uncertain and some questions can’t be solved because we don’t have enough information to explain them.

The big question now is: Are there any questions in philosophy that reason gives us, but that reason can’t answer? And is it okay to just say, “We can’t answer this because it’s completely uncertain,” even when we have enough of an idea to ask the question but no way to find the answer?

I say that in philosophy, especially the kind that deals with basic ideas (transcendental philosophy), there are no questions about things reason gives us that can’t be answered by reason. We can’t just say, “It’s too hard to know.” The same idea that makes us ask the question also means we should be able to find the answer, because the thing we’re asking about only exists as part of that idea.

In transcendental philosophy, the only questions that really need a clear answer are about the nature of the universe (cosmological questions). Philosophers can’t ignore these questions by saying they’re too confusing. These questions are about real things we experience, and whether they fit with our ideas.

If the thing we’re asking about is totally unknown, like what the soul really is or if there’s a cause of everything that always exists, we can’t say exactly what it is. But we can say that these questions only make sense if there’s something there to ask about.

So, all questions about the soul in this kind of philosophy can be answered because they deal with the part inside us that thinks but isn’t just a thing we can see or touch. These questions don’t fit with the usual rules we use to understand things.

In some cases, not having an answer is itself an answer, meaning sometimes saying “we don’t know” is the best response.
