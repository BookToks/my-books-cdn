It's okay to think of the soul as simple to help us understand how all the mind’s powers work together as one. Even if we can’t fully grasp it or explain how we judge what’s happening inside our minds, this idea can still be useful.

But saying the soul is a simple substance is a different story. This idea can’t be proven and would just be a random guess. We can’t experience something simple like that directly, so we don’t really know if it’s possible. If by substance we mean something we can sense and hold onto, then a simple thing like that doesn’t really make sense. We also can’t just believe in things that only exist in our minds if we don’t have good reasons for them. Still, since we don’t know if these things are possible or impossible, we can’t completely reject them either.

When we try to explain what we see or experience, we can only use reasons connected to those experiences by known laws. Using an idea that goes beyond what we can understand or see doesn’t really explain anything. Explaining something unknown by something even less understood doesn’t help us learn. Such ideas might make us feel better, but they don’t actually help us understand the world.

Things like order and purpose in nature have to be explained by natural causes and laws. Even wild guesses that are based on physical stuff are better than saying a divine power did it all, because that kind of explanation just avoids looking for real causes. It’s like lazy thinking that skips the hard work of understanding how things really happen. We can learn more about causes by observing and testing, but hiding behind comforting ideas doesn’t help.

In short, pure reason can’t solve everything about the world because what we know are only appearances. We shouldn’t expect to fully finish understanding everything just by following these appearances.
