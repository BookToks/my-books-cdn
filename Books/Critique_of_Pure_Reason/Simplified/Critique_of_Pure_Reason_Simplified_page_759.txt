The detailed plan of the "Dialectic" at R 5553 (around 1778-79 or 1780-81) shows that by then, Kant had come up with the idea of a three-part dialectic. He included a separate "Ideal of Pure Reason" (page 223), which brought back into his Critique the criticisms he made in 1763 about the ontological and physico-theological arguments.

Besides many specific thoughts, especially about the ontological argument, anyone interested in Kant’s ideas on rational theology should also check out the long set of notes on Johann August Eberhard's "Preparation for Natural Theology," kept as R 6206-310 (1783-88, pages 489-606), and the Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion, translated by A. Wood in a book edited by Di Giovanni and Wood called *Writings on Religion and Rational Theology* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pages 335-451.

It wasn’t Plato who said ideas are God’s thoughts, but this idea came from a mix of Platonism and Stoicism during the Middle Academy period. Thinkers like Albinus (second century B.C.) combined these ideas. Later, Platonists such as Philo of Alexandria, Plotinus, and St. Augustine adopted the theory of divine ideas. This idea became important for later Christian views of Platonism. You can read more about this in A. H. Armstrong’s *The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy* (Cambridge University Press, 1967), pages 64-66, 142, 245, and 621.

Many thoughts relate to the argument in this section. You can find explanations of the idea that fully defining any individual needs a completely determined "ens realissimum" (most real being) mostly without criticism in notes R 4244-9 (1769-70), R 4253 (1769-70), R 4255 (1769-70), R 4262 (1769-70 or 1772-76), R 4255 (1772-75), R 4569-70 (1772-75), R 4729 (1773-75), R 5270-74 (1776-78), R 5500 (1776-78), R 5502-5 (1776-78), and R 5522 (1776-78). Criticism of this idea only appears in notes written after the first publication of the Critique, like R 6248-56 (1785-88), R 6290 (1783-84), R 6293 (1783-84), and R 6298 (1783-84).

Following Leibniz, the Wolffians believed that each individual thing is defined by its complete concept. This concept is decided by choosing one side from every pair of opposite properties. They distinguish between a universal concept (which can apply to many individuals) and an individual concept (which defines one specific thing). The universal concept isn’t fully determined because it’s open about some opposite properties, while the individual concept follows what Baumgarten calls the "principle of thoroughgoing determination" (Metaphysica § 148). You can also see Wolff’s *Ontologia*, Baumgarten’s *Metaphysica* §§ 53 and 151, and Kant’s *Logic* § 15.
