The idea of Plato’s Republic is often seen as just a perfect dream that only exists in the mind of someone who has too much free time. Some people, like Brucker, think it’s silly for a philosopher to say that a ruler can only lead well if they understand these perfect ideas. But instead of ignoring this idea because it seems impossible, we should think about it more and try to understand it better, especially where the original idea doesn’t give us all the answers.

A good government should protect the most freedom for everyone, with laws that let each person’s freedom work together with others’. It doesn’t have to aim for the greatest happiness directly because that will come naturally. This idea is really important and should be the base for making laws and setting up a government. We should not worry about current problems that might stop this from happening because those problems might come from ignoring these true ideas when making laws. It’s bad for philosophers to say, “This can’t work because of what we see in real life,” because those problems wouldn’t exist if the right ideas had been used from the start. The better the laws match these ideas, the less punishment will be needed, and Plato was right to say that in a perfect system, punishment wouldn’t be needed at all. Even if we never reach perfect government, the idea of perfect government is still useful. It helps us make laws and governments better and closer to the best they can be. No one can decide the highest level of perfection because freedom means we can always improve and go beyond any limits we think exist.

Plato was also right to believe that ideas are the root of not only human reason and morality but also nature itself. Plants, animals, and the way the world is organized all show that they follow certain perfect ideas. No single plant or animal is exactly perfect for its species, just like no person is exactly perfect as a human being. But these perfect ideas exist in the highest form of understanding and never change.
