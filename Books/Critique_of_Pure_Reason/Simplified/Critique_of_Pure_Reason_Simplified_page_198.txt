First, we need to clearly explain what we think about how we understand things through our senses so no one gets it wrong.

We want to say that everything we see or feel is just how things appear to us. The things we sense aren’t exactly what they are by themselves, and their relationships aren’t really like how we see them. If we take away our mind or the way our senses work, then space and time, and how objects are arranged in them, would disappear too. These appearances only exist because of us, not on their own. What things are really like by themselves is something we don’t know at all. We only know how we see and feel them, which is unique to us humans. Space and time are the basic ways we sense things, and sensation is the stuff we sense.

We can understand space and time before we experience anything, so they are called “pure intuition.” But sensation depends on experience, so it’s called “empirical intuition.” Space and time are always part of how we sense things, no matter what we feel, but sensations can be very different. Even if we try really hard to understand our way of sensing perfectly, we still wouldn’t know what things are like by themselves. We only understand how we sense them, which depends on space and time. What objects really are will always be unknown, no matter how well we understand their appearances.

Our entire way of sensing is just a mixed-up version of things. It only contains what really belongs to them, but it's covered up by a lot of confusing parts we can’t separate. This messes up the idea of what sensing and appearances really mean.
