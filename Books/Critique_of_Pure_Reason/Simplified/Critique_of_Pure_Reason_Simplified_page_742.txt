Here are some important notes about Kant’s ideas and writings.

Some parts talk about Kant’s thoughts from the late 1700s, especially about how we understand things and how our mind works.

Kant talks about something called “intensive magnitude,” which is a way to measure how strong or intense something is. He wrote about this in the late 1770s.

There’s also a mention of Epicurus, an old philosopher, who thought about how we form ideas from experience. But Kant’s ideas are different because they include things we know before having any experience.

Kant’s “Analogies of Experience” are key to his argument about how we can know things are true before actually experiencing them. He worked on these ideas in the 1770s and wrote many notes about them.

The term “analogy” is used in different ways by Kant, especially when he talks about important principles like substance, cause, and connection.

Kant wrote a lot about the idea of substance—what things are made of and how they keep their identity over time. He argued that what we see as “accidents” or changes are just parts of the substance itself, not something separate.

This idea was partly to respond to Locke, another philosopher, who thought that even if we know some qualities of a thing, there’s always something unknown about it.

Kant returned to these points many times in his writings to explain how we can really know the world around us.
