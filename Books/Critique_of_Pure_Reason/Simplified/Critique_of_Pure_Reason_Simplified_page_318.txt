When we imagine things happening one after another, we put one event before and the other after. But this doesn’t mean that one event really happens before the other in the real world. Just by seeing things, we can’t tell for sure how they are connected or which comes first.

To understand the order for sure, we have to think about the relationship between the two events in a way that makes it clear which one must come first and which one after. The idea that helps us do this is the concept of cause and effect. Cause and effect is a pure idea our mind uses; it’s not something we get just by seeing things. The cause always comes before the effect in time, not just because we imagine it that way.

Because we use the rule of cause and effect, we can make sense of what we experience. Without this rule, we couldn’t understand how things change or happen one after another. So, things as we experience them only make sense if they follow this rule.

Our mind always notices things one after another, step by step. The images or ideas we have come in order. But whether the actual things outside us also happen in this order is a different question. When we say something is an object, it can mean different things. Sometimes we just mean it is something we think about, not necessarily something real.

When we only think about these images or ideas, they are part of what we are aware of. They happen in our mind one after another. If these images were real things by themselves, we wouldn’t be able to tell how they fit together just by noticing their order in our mind.

So, all we really deal with are our own ideas and how they come one after another. We can’t know for sure how things are in themselves, beyond what we experience.
