Logic has been very successful, but it also has its limits because it only focuses on itself. It ignores all the things it thinks about and the differences between them. So, logic deals only with its own form and nothing else.  

Because of this, it's much harder for reason to become a true science when it has to think about real things and not just itself. Logic is like the outside part of a science, a starting point. When we want to learn about real things, we need to look at actual sciences, not just logic.  

For reason to work in these sciences, there must be some knowledge that comes before any experience (a priori). This knowledge can relate to its object in two ways: either it just defines the object and its idea (which has to come from somewhere else), or it actually makes the object real. The first is called theoretical knowledge, and the second is practical knowledge.  

The pure part of reason, which deals only with knowledge that comes before experience, needs to be explained all by itself. We shouldn’t mix this pure knowledge with knowledge that comes from other places because it’s important to know what part is reliable and what part isn’t.  

Math and physics are two kinds of theoretical knowledge where reason tries to define their objects before experience. Math does this completely on its own, while physics partly depends on other sources too.  

Math has been studied for a very long time, starting with the ancient Greeks. But it wasn’t always easy for math to become a true science like logic, which only deals with itself. Math struggled for a long time, mostly with the Egyptians, until one smart person had a sudden great idea. This idea changed everything and showed the right path for math to become a real science forever.
