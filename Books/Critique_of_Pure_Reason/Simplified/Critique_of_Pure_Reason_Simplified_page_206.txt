Our thinking comes from two main parts of the mind. The first part is how we receive impressions or information about things. The second part is how we understand or make sense of these impressions. The first part gives us the object, and the second part helps us think about it.

So, to know something, we need both feelings or pictures in our mind (called intuition) and ideas or concepts. Neither just ideas without feelings nor just feelings without ideas can give us real knowledge. Both feelings and ideas can be pure or based on experience. If they include sensations from real objects, they are based on experience. If not, they are pure. Pure feelings only show the shape or form of something, and pure ideas only show how we think about objects in general. Pure feelings or ideas come before experience, but those based on experience come after.

If we call the mind’s ability to receive impressions “sensibility,” then the mind’s ability to create ideas or think is called “understanding.” Our feelings or intuitions always come from how objects affect us. But the ability to think about these feelings is the understanding.

Neither sensibility nor understanding is more important than the other. Without sensibility, we wouldn’t get information about objects, and without understanding, we couldn’t think about them. Thoughts without real content are empty, and feelings without ideas are meaningless.
