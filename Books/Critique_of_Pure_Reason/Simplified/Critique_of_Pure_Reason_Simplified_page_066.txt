Kant talks about how we understand what we see and experience. He says that when we explain what we see, we need a basic rule or reason behind it. The way we explain what we think depends on being aware of it, but explaining what we actually experience depends on how our mind connects different sensations together. So, explaining appearances means figuring out the reason why our sensations are linked.

To make it simpler, Kant says there is a rule in our mind that helps organize what we feel and think. Appearances don’t have any order by themselves; they only make sense because our mind arranges them in a certain way. Everything we experience must be understood as one whole, and this happens because our mind unites all the pieces. This unity is connected to how we understand space and time, because without space and time, we couldn’t really picture anything clearly.

The rules for explaining what we see come from two places: how we notice things and how we understand them. These rules are not learned from experience but actually make experience possible. Kant argues that even though we get all our ideas in time and space, our mind has built-in rules that help us connect these ideas in the right order. These rules come from concepts inside our mind that apply to everything we experience, but they only work when we explain what we see.

This idea helps solve a problem Kant mentioned in a letter in 1772 and later led him to write his famous book, the Critique. But Kant hasn’t clearly shown yet how these rules, or categories, are the necessary conditions for organizing what we experience. So far, he has only given some hints and ideas that don’t fully explain it.
