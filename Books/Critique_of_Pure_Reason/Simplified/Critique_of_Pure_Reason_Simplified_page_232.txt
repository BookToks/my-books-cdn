Law experts, when they talk about rights and claims, make a clear difference between what is legal (what the law says) and other questions.

In the second edition of this book, a paragraph number was added. In the first edition, the second chapter of the "Transcendental Analytic," called the "Transcendental Deduction," is split into three main parts. The first part is further divided into two smaller parts. 

Except for a few small changes in words, which are pointed out, and the added paragraph numbers, the two smaller parts of the first section stay the same in the second edition. They are exactly the same until the last paragraph of the second smaller part, which is replaced by three new paragraphs in the second edition. The second and third parts of the chapter in the first edition are then replaced by a brand new second part in the second edition. This new part is divided into numbered paragraphs from § 5 to § 27.

We will show all of this material in this order: first, the first section as it was in both editions, with the last paragraph from the first edition followed by the three new paragraphs that replaced it in the second edition; then the second and third sections as they were in the first edition; and finally, the new second section with numbered parts § 5 through § 27 as it appeared in the second edition.

Here are some notes from Kant's copy of the first edition: "Consciousness and inner sense are different. When I say 'I think,' it means I am active, and this does not depend on any object. But the idea I think about must be given to me first through my senses or imagination. It affects me in some way."

He also wrote: "It must be proven that if we didn’t have a way to sense things before thinking (called sensible intuition a priori), and if this wasn’t how we experience the world, then:

1. The categories (basic concepts) wouldn’t mean anything.

2. We couldn’t have any synthetic a priori knowledge (knowledge that is both new and necessarily true)."
