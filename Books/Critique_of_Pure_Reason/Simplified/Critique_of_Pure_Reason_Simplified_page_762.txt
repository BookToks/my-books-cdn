By the time he gave his Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine of Religion (around 1783), he definitely knew about it.

This is probably a reference to the title of Kant’s own book, The Only Possible Ground of Proof (1763). But that title not only points to a different argument than the ontological argument, it also includes Kant’s first critique of the ontological argument.

You can see an early outline of the different ideas about theology in R 4113 (from around 1769 to 1771).

Kant later explores the idea of a practical basis for theology much more in the "Canon of Pure Reason," as well as in his Critique of Practical Reason and Critique of Judgment. Also check out R 5624 (from around 1778-81) and R 6086-117 (1783-88).

Kant’s view on physico-theology now seems to match what he wrote in The Only Possible Ground of Proof. See note 108 for more on this.

There aren’t many notes about this appendix, but one can be found in R 5602 (from the late 1770s to early 1780s).

The rule now called "Ockham’s razor" is named after William of Ockham (who lived around 1288-1350). Ockham used a rule like this a lot, but the exact wording Kant quotes comes from Ioannes Poncius, who died in 1660. Poncius said something like “entities shouldn’t be multiplied without a good reason.” This idea was actually first explained by John Duns Scotus before Ockham used it.

Even though the idea started with Scotus, it got linked to Ockham because he was famous for keeping things simple and breaking down ideas. He even used this rule to criticize Scotus himself. The original idea goes all the way back to Aristotle.

Wit (or ingenium) means a natural mental talent. It has two types: one is the ability to compare and connect things that seem different, and the other is the skill to notice small differences. Here, Kant seems to mean the first kind, because it’s about being able to tell things apart. You can see this in Anthropology § 54.

This way of putting things is already in R 5080 (from 1776-78).

The Law of Continuity says that nature doesn’t leave gaps in the patterns it follows, even though not all things fit into the same patterns. This idea comes from Leibniz’s New Essays on Human Understanding.
