Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic

The idea of space doesn’t mean anything by itself. We only talk about space when we see things or sense them.

Our ability to sense things always follows a certain pattern, which we call sensibility. This is necessary for us to notice objects outside of ourselves. If we think about sensibility without any objects, it becomes pure space.

We can’t say that the way we sense things is how things really are on their own. Space includes everything we can see outside of us, but not necessarily everything that exists, whether or not it can be sensed.

We can’t be sure if other thinking beings experience space the same way we do. If we add the idea that we are only talking about things as we sense them, then what we say about space is always true for us.

For example, the statement “All things are next to one another in space” is true only if we mean things as we sense them. If we say “All things, as things we sense outside us, are next to one another in space,” then this is true everywhere and always.

This means space is real when we talk about anything we can experience outside ourselves. But space is just an idea when we think about things by themselves, without considering how we sense them.

So, space is real for all the things we can experience, but it doesn’t exist on its own beyond our experience.
