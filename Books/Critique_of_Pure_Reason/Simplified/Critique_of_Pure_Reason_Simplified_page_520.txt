You can never actually experience the object itself because it can’t be shown to you in any possible experience. When you see or sense things, you’re always stuck with conditions like space and time. You never get to something without conditions, so you can’t tell if this “unconditioned” thing starts everything or if it’s the whole endless series.

The idea of the “whole” thing, like the entire world or all the parts that make it up, is always just a comparison. The absolute whole of size, parts, or existence, and questions about whether it has an end or goes on forever, don’t connect to any experience you can have.

For example, whether you think a body is made of tiny simple parts or parts that are always made of smaller parts, you won’t explain how it looks any better. You can’t see a simple or an infinite combination. You only explain appearances based on what you can perceive, but everything that makes up the entire whole isn’t a perception itself. Yet, it’s this whole that people want to explain when they ask big questions about reason.

Since these big questions can never be solved by experience, you can’t say it’s unclear what the object really is about them. The object only exists in your mind and can’t be given outside it. So, you just need to make sure you agree with yourself and don’t confuse your ideas with something you actually experienced. This means trying to say you know the answer for sure is not just uncertain but impossible. The best way is to focus on understanding how your knowledge works, not to try to find an objective answer.
