Saying something and its opposite at the same time creates a contradiction, which doesn’t really say anything useful. When you combine equal forces going in opposite directions, you don’t get nothing; you get a state of rest, which is real. So, many sciences need to understand positive and negative amounts, not just the logical idea of contradiction. Kant’s main idea, hinted at earlier, is that basic logical rules like identity and contradiction aren’t enough to fully understand the real world. Philosophy also needs to consider real, physical principles. He points out that cause and effect aren’t opposites but real connections, and you can’t just figure them out by analyzing ideas.

This brings up a big question: “How do I understand that because one thing exists, something else happens?” Understanding real opposites, real causes, and real connections is a core problem in philosophy. Kant disagreed with Crusius’s way of solving this problem and didn’t mention Hume’s idea, even though Hume’s work was available in German. But Kant said we should try to explain clearly how one thing causes another, and that it’s not just because of logical contradictions. He thought deeply about how we understand causes and effects and promised to explain his thoughts in detail one day.

That day didn’t come until he published the Critique of Pure Reason in 1781. Kant had found a problem but didn’t have the answer yet. Still, he wasn’t waiting for someone else to wake him up from his old ideas.

In the 1760s, Kant wrote three important works: Observations on the Beautiful and Sublime (1764); Dreams of a Spirit-Seer (1766), which criticized extreme spiritual ideas while hinting at his later moral ideas; and On the Differentiation of Directions in Space (1768). The last one used examples like right- and left-handed gloves to support Newton’s idea of absolute space, arguing against Leibniz’s idea that space is just a way to describe relationships between objects without real differences in direction.
