This only happens when the object is given to us, but for humans, this can only happen if it affects our mind in a certain way. The ability to get images or ideas from how objects affect us is called sensibility. Objects are given to us through sensibility, and sensibility alone gives us intuitions. But we think about these objects using our understanding, which creates concepts. All thinking, whether direct or indirect, must connect to intuitions, which for us means sensibility, because that's the only way objects can be given to us.

The effect an object has on our ability to form ideas, when it affects us, is called sensation. The intuition connected to the object through sensation is called empirical. The unknown object behind an empirical intuition is called appearance.

I call the part of the appearance that matches the sensation its matter, and the part that organizes the different parts of the appearance in certain ways I call the form of appearance.
