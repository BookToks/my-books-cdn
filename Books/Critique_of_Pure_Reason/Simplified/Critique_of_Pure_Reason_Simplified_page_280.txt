These are: un足 derstanding, the power of judgment, and reason. In its analytic that doctrine accordingly deals with concepts, judgments, and inferences, corresponding exactly to the functions and the order of those powers of A 131 mind, which are comprehended under the broad designation of under足 standing in general.
 
 Since merely formal logic, so conceived, abstracts from all content of B 170 cognition (whether it be pure or empirical), and concerns itself merely with the form of thinking (of discursive cognition) in general, it can also include in its analytical part the canon for reason, the form of which has its secure precept, into which there can be priori insight through mere a analysis of the actions of reason into their moments, without taking into consideration the particular nature of the cognition about which it is employed.
 
 Transcendental logic, since it is limited to a determinate content, namely that of pure priori cognitions alone, cannot imitate general a logic in this division. For it turns out that the transcendental use of reason is not objectively valid at all, thus does not belong to the logic of truth, i.e., the analytic, but rather, as a logic of illusion, requires a special part of the scholastic edifice, under the name of the transcen足 dental dialectic.
 
 Understanding and the power of judgment accordingly have their canon of objectively valid, thus true use in transcendental logic, and therefore belong in its analytical part. Only reason in its attempts to make out something about objects priori and to extend cognition bea yond the bounds of possible experience is wholly and entirely dialecti- B 171/A lp cal, and its illusory assertions do not fit into a canon of the sort that the analytic ought to contain.
 
 The analytic of principles will accordingly be solely a canon for the power of judgment that teaches it to apply to appearances the con足 cepts of the understanding, which contain the condition for rules pria 267 Doctrine of Elements.
