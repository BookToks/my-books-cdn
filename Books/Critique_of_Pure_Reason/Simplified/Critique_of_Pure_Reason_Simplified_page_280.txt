These are understanding, judgment, and reason. This part of the theory looks at ideas, decisions, and conclusions, which match how these mental abilities work together under the general idea of understanding.

Formal logic, as explained here, ignores the content of what we know (whether it’s pure or from experience) and focuses only on the structure of thinking in general. Because of this, it can also include rules for reason, which can be known before any experience just by analyzing how reason works, without thinking about what we are actually thinking about.

Transcendental logic is different because it deals only with pure knowledge we can have before experience. It can’t be like general logic in this way. This is because using reason in this special way isn’t truly valid when talking about objects, so it doesn’t belong to the logic of truth (the analytic part). Instead, it belongs to a part called the transcendental dialectic, which deals with illusions made by reason.

Understanding and judgment have rules that are truly valid in transcendental logic, so they belong in its analytic part. But reason, when it tries to know things about objects before experience and goes beyond what we can experience, is completely dialectical and its false claims don’t fit into the rules that the analytic should have.

So, the part about principles is only a set of rules for judgment. It teaches judgment how to use understanding’s ideas when looking at appearances, which are needed to create rules.
