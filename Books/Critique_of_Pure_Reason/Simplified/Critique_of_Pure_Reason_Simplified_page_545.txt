Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter II talks about how things we see happen in a certain order, and this order always follows rules we understand.

Now, when we think about causes that aren’t part of this order of appearances—that is, causes that we can’t actually see—something different happens compared to when we try to explain things just by using math. In the math case, both opposing ideas had to be proven wrong. But here, the causes we can’t see help explain things in a way that makes sense both logically and practically. While the arguments that try to find an ultimate cause fail, the ideas that are adjusted this way can both be true. This wouldn’t happen if we only thought about causes as part of the visible chain, because then every cause would have to be something we can see, just another link in the chain.

Section III.

This part explains how we can understand the idea that everything that happens in the world comes from causes.

There are two main ways to think about causes: either by nature or by freedom. The first means one event follows another in a natural order based on rules. Since causes depend on time, if a cause had always existed, it couldn’t create something new that starts at a specific time. So, the cause of something happening must also follow rules about time.

For understanding, we don’t allow any cause among appearances that itself isn’t caused by something else we can experience. But if we imagine a cause that can’t be seen and isn’t part of the chain of appearances, it wouldn’t break the chain of causes we do see. This hidden cause could be accepted as something that doesn’t have a cause we experience, without breaking the rule that causes happen in a continuous chain we can observe.
