Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II Remark on the Second Antinomy I. On the Thesis When I talk about a whole which necessarily consists of simple parts, I understand thereby a substantial whole only as a proper composite, i.e., as a contingent unity of a manifold that, given as separated (at least in thought), is posited in a reciprocal combination and thereby constitutes one entity. Properly speaking, one should call space not a c071p1 ositu711o but a totU711,b because its parts are possible only in the whole, and not the whole through the parts. In any case, it could be called a c071p1 ositu711 ide足 aleC but not a c071p1 ositu711 reale. d Yet this is only a subtlety. For since space is not a composite of substances (not even of real accidents), if I remove all composition from it, then nothing, not even a point, might be left over; for a point is possible only as the boundary of a space (hence of a composite). Thus space and time do not consist of simple parts. What belongs only to the state of a substance, even if it has a magnitude (e.g., alteration), does not, therefore, consist of the simple, i.e., a certain de足 gree of alteration does not arise through the accumulation of many sim足 ple alterations. Our inference from the composite to the simple is valid only for things subsisting by themselves.' But accidents of a state do not subsist by themselves. Thus one can easily ruin the proof for the neces足 sity of simples as constituent parts of every substantial composite (and thus also the whole thesis), if one extends the proof too far and tries to make it valid for all composites without distinction, as has sometimes actually happened.
