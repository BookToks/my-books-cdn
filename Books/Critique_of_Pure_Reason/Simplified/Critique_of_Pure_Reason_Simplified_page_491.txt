When I talk about a whole made up of simple parts, I mean a real thing that is a mix of different pieces joined together. These pieces can be thought of as separate but come together to make one thing.

Space, though, is different. It's not really made up of parts like a normal object. Its parts only exist because of the whole space, not the other way around. So, space is more like a total thing, not a mix of parts.

If you take away all parts from space, nothing would be left—not even a single point. A point only exists as the edge of some space, which is a whole made of parts. So, space and time don’t have simple parts.

Things like changes in an object (like getting hotter or colder) don’t happen by adding up simple changes. This is because these changes don’t exist on their own like real things do.

So, the idea that everything is made of simple parts only works for things that exist on their own. It doesn’t apply to changes or states that depend on something else.

If people try to use this idea for everything without thinking carefully, they can easily mess up the argument that everything has to be made of simple parts.
