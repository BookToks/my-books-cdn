In different public writings, like book reviews and special essays, I have happily noticed that the spirit of careful thinking hasn’t disappeared in Germany. It was only covered up for a short time by the loud, trendy idea of freedom of thought that thinks it’s really clever. I see that the difficult paths of criticism, which lead to a strict but lasting science of pure reason, haven’t stopped brave and clear-minded people from understanding them.

I leave it to these deserving people, who mix careful insight with the skill to explain things clearly (something I know I’m not good at), to finish my work, which might be lacking in this area. Here, the risk is not that I will be proven wrong, but that I won’t be understood.

From now on, I won’t get involved in arguments, but I will pay close attention to all feedback, whether it comes from friends or critics. I want to use this advice, according to my introduction, in the future development of my system.

Since I’m getting older (I will turn sixty-four this month), I have to manage my time carefully if I want to finish my plan to provide the metaphysics of both nature and morals. This will support the correctness of the critique of both theoretical and practical reason. I also have to wait for the unclear parts at the start of this work to become clearer and for the defense of the whole system by those worthy people who have really understood it.

Any philosophical work can be criticized in some parts (because it can’t be as perfectly protected as a math book), but the whole system, seen as one complete unit, is safe. When a system is new, few people have the skill to understand it fully. Also, since new ideas annoy many people, even fewer want to try.

Sometimes, contradictions seem to appear if single parts are taken out of context and compared, especially in informal writing. This can make the work look bad to those who trust others’ opinions, but someone who understands the whole idea can easily clear up these problems.

If a theory is really strong, over time the challenges it faces will only help smooth out its rough edges. If honest, insightful, and popular people take the job seriously, they will soon give the theory the polish it needs.
