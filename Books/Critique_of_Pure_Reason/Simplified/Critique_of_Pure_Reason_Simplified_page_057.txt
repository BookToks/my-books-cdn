Kant tried to fix a problem with his idea that different objects really interact with each other, but he couldn't solve it. Not only this problem but also the idea that pure ideas from our mind, like the idea of "substance," can give us true knowledge about things as they really are will be dropped in his later work. Instead, he will say that objects must interact for us to experience them as being in different places at the same time ("Third Analogy"). Also, his old ideas about how we understand things will be replaced by his new view that pure ideas of reason can trick us if we use them alone for knowledge, though they can still be useful for practical reasons.

The same big change happens in Kant’s discussion about the "method in metaphysics" near the end of his early work.

Kant starts by saying that philosophy doesn’t have a special method to guide regular science because science just uses logic to organize ideas that come from experience. But metaphysics is different because it uses the mind to create original ideas. So, in metaphysics, having the right method is very important.

Kant then says the main rule for metaphysics is to be very careful so that the rules for our senses don’t wrongly affect how we use our understanding. The biggest problem in metaphysics comes from thinking that the limits of what we can sense are also limits on what we can know with our mind.

He gives three mistaken ideas people often have:  
1. The same conditions we need to sense something are the conditions needed for the thing to exist.  
2. The same conditions we need to compare things to form concepts are the conditions needed for the thing to exist.  
3. The same conditions we need to fit something under a concept are the conditions needed for the thing to exist.

In other words, Kant says it’s wrong to think that the limits of our senses and how we form ideas from what we sense limit what metaphysics can know about objects as they really are.
