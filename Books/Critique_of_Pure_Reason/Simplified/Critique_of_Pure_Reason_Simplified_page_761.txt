Kant’s first criticism of this argument can be found in his work called The Only Possible Ground of Proof.

There are fewer thoughts about the criticism of the design argument compared to others. But Kant’s discussion of moral theology in his Critique of Judgment is based on an earlier critique of physico-theology.

In The Only Possible Ground of Proof, Kant says physico-theology should not be seen as proof that God exists. Instead, he thinks it is just a way to look at nature. He also criticizes the usual way physico-theology is done and suggests a better method that fits natural science.

Kant was impressed by the tiny creatures found in just one drop of water, discovered by John Hill. These creatures fight and survive in a small world full of action. When Kant thinks about this and also the huge universe filled with countless worlds, he feels amazed and finds it hard to put into words.

David Hume, another philosopher, described the world as one big machine made of many smaller machines, all perfectly working together. Kant knew about Hume’s ideas when he was writing the Critique of Pure Reason, but it’s not clear if he had read them before writing this part.
