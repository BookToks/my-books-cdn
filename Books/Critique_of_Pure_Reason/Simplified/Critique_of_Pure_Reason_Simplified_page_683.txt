In math, this kind of mistake just can’t happen, so using a proof by contradiction makes sense there. In natural science, since everything is based on what we actually observe, these kinds of mistakes can often be avoided by checking lots of examples. But this type of proof isn’t very important in science.  

When pure reason tries to figure things out, it often gets tricked by its own confusing ideas, where what seems real is actually just how our mind tricks us. Because of this, we can’t just say something is true by proving the opposite is false.  

Either, the proof only shows that the opposite idea doesn’t make sense to our mind, but that doesn’t mean the original thing is definitely true. For example, we can’t fully understand the idea of a necessary highest being, so proofs about it are often just about how our minds react, not about the real thing itself. Or, both ideas might be based on impossible ideas, meaning neither is correct. So, you can’t find the truth just by disproving the opposite idea.  

For example, if you assume the world we can see is the whole world, it’s wrong to say it must be either infinite or finite just because both those ideas don’t work. That’s because appearances are only how things look to us, not the things themselves, and thinking about the whole world like that is impossible.  

Proof by contradiction can also trick people who like to argue a lot. It’s like a fighter who says they’ll take on anyone who doubts them, but this only shows who is stronger in arguing, not who is actually right. People watching see that each side wins and loses sometimes, so they might start to doubt the whole argument.
