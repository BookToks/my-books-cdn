When I compare different ideas or images in my mind with how I understand things, and figure out if they belong to pure thinking or pure sensing, I call this transcendental reflection. The way ideas relate to each other can be about being the same or different, agreeing or opposing, inside or outside, and about what can be changed and what changes it (like matter and form). How we decide these relationships depends on whether they come from our senses or from our understanding. This difference really changes how we should think about these ideas.

Before making any judgments about something real, we compare ideas to see if they are the same (to make universal judgments) or different (to make specific ones), if they agree (for positive judgments) or oppose (for negative ones), and so on. Because of this, we might call these ideas concepts of comparison. But if we look at the actual things behind the ideas, whether they are really the same or different, agreeing or opposing, these things relate to our mind in two ways: through sensing or understanding. 

So, it’s this connection to sensing or understanding that decides how the ideas relate to each other. We can’t just tell if things are the same or different by comparing ideas alone. Instead, we need transcendental reflection, which means thinking about what kind of knowing is involved. Only then can we figure out how things really relate, because just comparing ideas isn’t enough.
