Representation is not just a simple outline or picture of an object. Instead, it’s a kind of rule inside our mind that helps us organize what we sense from the object’s presence.

Kant says the mind uses two kinds of thinking. The first is called the "logical" use, where it arranges ideas according to rules, like making sure things don’t contradict each other. The second is the "real" use, where the mind creates ideas about things or how they relate.

Kant explains that the logical use of the mind helps us compare different things we see and turn those appearances into real experience. But the real use of the mind creates big ideas like "possibility," "existence," or "cause," which we don’t get from our senses. These ideas help us think about things beyond what we can see, like the idea of God or being morally perfect.

So, when the mind works logically, it just organizes information from our senses. But when it works really, it makes new ideas on its own to understand things that can’t be sensed or to set goals for how we act.

These ideas help explain some of Kant’s later work, but they also bring up problems that he will try to fix later.

First, Kant says our senses are passive—they just receive information—while our mind is active and works on that information. But later, he also says that senses are part of our thinking abilities, and since thinking means being active, senses must have some active part too. This means while our senses get affected by the outside world, we also actively shape what we sense into something meaningful.

Finally, Kant gives two reasons why he thinks our senses only show us how things appear, not things as they really are. But these reasons have some problems that need more explanation later.
