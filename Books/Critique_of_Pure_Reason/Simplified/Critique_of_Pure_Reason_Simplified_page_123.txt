So, until now, metaphysics has mostly been a kind of guessing around, and the worst part is that it’s just guessing with ideas, not real things.

Why is it that science still hasn’t found a solid way to understand metaphysics? Is it even possible? If it is, why does our mind keep pushing us to find that way, like it’s super important? And if our mind can’t find it, or worse, tricks us and then lets us down, how can we trust it? Or if we just haven’t found the way yet, what clues can we use to hope that future tries will do better than past ones?

I think we should look at math and natural science. They got better all at once because they completely changed how they think. That change was really important. So maybe we should try copying that idea in metaphysics, as much as it makes sense.

Up to now, people thought that what we know has to match the things we’re trying to understand. But trying to learn about things just using ideas before seeing them hasn’t worked. So let’s try the opposite: what if the things we learn about have to match how we understand them? This idea fits better with knowing something before actually seeing it. It’s like when Copernicus couldn’t explain the stars by thinking the stars moved around us, so he tried thinking that we move instead, and the stars stay still. 

We can try something similar with metaphysics. If how we see things has to match how the things really are, then we can’t know anything before seeing them. But if the things match how we see them, then I can imagine that working. 

But I can’t just stop with seeing things; I have to connect what I see to an actual object. To do that, either the ideas I use to understand the object match the real object — which is tricky to believe — or the objects, or the experiences where I find those objects, match the ideas I use. This second option is easier because experience needs understanding, and I already have rules in my mind before I see anything. These rules come before experience and all things I experience have to follow them. So, the things I experience must fit with these ideas.
