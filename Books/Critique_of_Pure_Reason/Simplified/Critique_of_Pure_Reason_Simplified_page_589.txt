These two ideas don’t really talk about things as they actually are, because if they did, they would contradict each other. So, these ideas aren’t about the real world but only about how our mind reasons. One idea says that for everything that exists, we should always look for a necessary explanation that never stops until it’s fully explained from the start. The other idea says we should never expect to find a final explanation and not assume anything we see is the ultimate cause without more proof.

Both ideas can work together because they just help guide our thinking. One tells us to think about nature as if there’s a first cause for everything, which helps us organize what we know. The other warns us not to treat any cause we find as the absolute first cause, but always to stay open to finding more causes.

Since everything we see must have a cause, nothing we experience can be the absolute first cause. So, the absolute first cause must be outside the world, serving only as the main principle that explains everything we see. We can’t find it inside the world because we must always see causes in the world as coming from something else.

Ancient philosophers thought everything in nature could change, but they believed matter was original and necessary. But if they thought about matter itself, not just as what things appear to be made of, the idea that it must absolutely exist would disappear. Reason doesn’t force us to believe matter must exist for sure; we can imagine it not existing without any problem. This belief in absolute necessity comes only from how we think, not from reality. So, a certain rule helps us believe this. In fact, the ideas of space and that things can’t pass through each other (which define matter) are the strongest principles we get from experience.
