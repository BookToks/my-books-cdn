Paralogisms of pure reason happen when we think about things based only on outer senses, like space. Space isn’t a real thing by itself; it’s just a way we picture things. Only what we see or sense in space can be real, and if something is given to us through our senses, it is real in space. If it wasn’t real, we couldn’t just imagine it out of nowhere before experiencing it.

Every time we see something outside, it proves that there’s something real in space, or it is real. So, we can trust that what we see around us really exists in space. But space and everything in it only exist in our minds as pictures. Still, the stuff we see in space is really there and not just made up. 

It’s impossible for anything outside of us to be given to us directly because space itself is just part of how we experience things. Even the strongest idealists can’t ask for proof that something outside us matches what we see because to see it, it has to be in space, and space is only a way we represent things in our minds. So, what we see is only real in our perception and can’t be real in any other way.

We learn about objects from what we perceive, either by imagining or by experience. Sometimes, our imagination tricks us, like in dreams, or our judgment makes mistakes, like when our senses deceive us. To avoid these false illusions, we have to be careful and check our perceptions.
