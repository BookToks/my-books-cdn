A few years after Immanuel Kant published his book Critique of Pure Reason in 1781, people recognized him as one of the most important philosophers of modern times. Many thought he was one of the greatest philosophers ever. His fame soon spread beyond Germany, and his works were translated into English even before 1800. Since then, people have understood and interpreted Kant’s ideas in different ways, and some agreed with him more than others, but everyone agrees he is very important. Many scholars have worked hard to create good English translations of his writings and also translated them into other languages.

There are four main reasons for this new edition of Kant’s writings:

1. Completeness. Most of Kant’s works published while he was alive have been translated before, some more than once. But only small parts of his many important unpublished works have ever been translated. These include his Opus postumum, an unfinished big work about the link between philosophy and physics; his lecture notes; his letters; and his personal notes. One goal of this edition is to make a good selection of these materials available in English for the first time.

2. Availability. Many English translations of Kant’s works, especially the less famous ones, have been hard to find or out of print for a long time. But these works are very important for understanding how Kant’s ideas developed. Not having them easily available might have caused English-speaking philosophers to misunderstand or overlook some parts of his philosophy.

3. Organization. Another goal of this edition is to make all of Kant’s published works, both big and small, available in complete volumes. These will be arranged in order of time and by topic to help English-speaking readers study his philosophy more seriously.
