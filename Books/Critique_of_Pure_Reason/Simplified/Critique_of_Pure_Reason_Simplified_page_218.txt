The understanding is not about seeing or feeling things directly. Instead, it works by using ideas called concepts. Humans understand things by thinking with these concepts, not by just directly sensing them.

All senses depend on feelings, but concepts depend on how we organize and connect ideas in our minds. A function here means how our mind puts different thoughts together under one main idea. Concepts come from our ability to think actively, while senses come from receiving information from the outside world.

The understanding uses concepts mainly to make judgments. Only sensing gives us a direct connection to an object. Concepts don’t connect directly to things but relate to other ideas or senses. Judgment is like understanding something by thinking about a thought of it, not the thing itself.

For example, in the sentence "All bodies are divisible," the idea of "divisible" is linked to many other ideas, especially the idea of "body," which connects to what we see or experience. So, the concept of divisibility represents objects through these connections, not directly.

All judgments help us unify our ideas by grouping many thoughts under one bigger thought. Every action of understanding can be traced back to making judgments, which means understanding is basically the ability to judge or think. Thinking is knowing through concepts, and concepts are ideas that relate to things we don’t fully know yet.

For example, the concept of "body" means something like metal, which we can know through that idea. It’s a concept because it includes other ideas that help us understand what it means.
