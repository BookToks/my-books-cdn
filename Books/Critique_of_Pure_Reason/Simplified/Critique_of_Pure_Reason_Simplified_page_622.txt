When we think about big ideas like God or the ultimate cause of everything, we often use ideas that seem necessary but whose real source we don’t actually know. We just assume there has to be something supreme to explain why these ideas make sense, like when I imagine a perfect being based only on an idea.

But I can’t really say this perfect being truly exists by itself because the way I understand things doesn’t fully apply to it. Concepts like reality, substance, cause and effect, or necessity only help us understand things we experience, not the whole world or everything that exists.

Still, I can imagine such a being as an idea connected to the world we experience, even if I can’t fully know it. For example, when I use my reason to make sense of the world, I rely on the idea that everything fits together perfectly, even though I can never see this perfect system completely in real life.

Because this idea is so important for understanding the world, I’m not just allowed but kind of forced to think of this perfect being as real in some way. I imagine it as something I don’t really know but that causes the whole world to be the way it is.

I picture this being as having all the best qualities of things we know—like being real, having substance, causing things to happen, and being necessary—all at the highest level. Since this idea comes from my reason, I think of this being as the ultimate reason for everything, the cause of the entire universe, perfectly united and orderly.

By doing this, I leave out anything that would limit this idea, so I can explain how everything fits together in the world. In this way, I see all parts of the universe as if they were planned by this highest reason, and my own reason is just a small copy of it.

So, I think about this highest reason using concepts that really only apply to what I can experience, but I use them to understand something much bigger.
