Critique of all speculative theology tive principle/ which we recognize as necessary, but whose source we do not know,b and for which we assume a supreme ground merely with the intention of thinking the universality of the principlec all the more deÂ­ terminately, as, e.g., when I think as existing a being that corresponds to a mere and indeed transcendental idea. For here I can never assume the existence of this thing in itself, because none of the concepts through which I can think any object determinately will attain to it, and the con- A677! B 705 ditions for the objective validity of my concepts are excluded by the idea itself. The concepts of reality, substance, causality, even that of necessity in existence have, beyond their use in making possible the empirical cognition of an object, no significance at all which might determine any object.d They can therefore be used for explaining the possibility of things in the world of sense, but not the possibility of a world-whole itself, because this ground of explanation would have to be outside the world and hence it would not be an object of a possible experience. Now I can nevertheless assume such an incomprehensible being, the object of a mere idea, relative to the world of sense, though not in itself. For if the greatest possible empirical use of my reason is grounded on an idea (that of systematic complete unity, about which I will have more to say presently), which in itself can never be presented adequately in experience, even tllOugh it is unavoidably necessary for approximating to the highest possible degree of empirical unity, then I am not only warranted but even compelled to realize this idea, i.e., to posit for it an actual object, but only as a Something in general with which I am not acquainted at all and to which, as a ground of that systematic unity and in relation to that, I give such properties as are analogous to the concepts of the un- A678! B 706 derstanding in their empirical use. Thus according to the analogy of realities in the world, of substances, causality, and necessity, I will think of a being that possesses all of these in their highest perfection, and since this idea rests merely on my reason, I am able to think this being as selfsufficient reason, which is the cause of the world-whole through ideas of the greatest harmony and unity; thus I leave out all conditions limiting the idea, so as -under the auspicese of such an original ground -to make possible systematic unity of the manifold in the world-whole and, by means of this unity, the greatest possible empirical use of reason, by seeing all combinations as if they were ordained by a highest reason of which our reason is only a weak copy. Then I think this highest reason through mere concepts, which really have their application only in the Princip a h erkennen , Princip Object d , Schutze 609 Doctrine of Elements.
