1773-75? 17=583-4), R 4708 (1773-79, 17:682-3) and R 4717 (1773-75? 1775-77? 17:685).
 
 55 This argument has a long history in the Western philosophical-theological tradition, where a number of Christian philosophers used it to demon­ strate the origin of the world at a finite past time, contrary to the pagan (especially Aristotelian) view that the world had no beginning in time. But it is not clear from what source Kant derived it (or whether he reinvented it himself). The argument appears to have been first invented by John Philoponus (c49Q-c.570). In the middle ages, it was most closely associ­ ated with the name of St. Bonaventure (C.1217-1274). But Bonaventure seems to have gotten it from his older Franciscan contemporary Richard Rufus of Cornwall (d. after 1259), who does not seem to have known the works of Philoponus and may have devised the argument anew around 1235. The argument was criticized by a number of medieval philosophers (notably St. Thomas Aquinas and WIlliam of Ockham) who held that the creation of the world at a finite past time was indemonstrable by reason and knowable only through revelation. Kant, however, does not appear to have been directly acquainted with any of these medieval sources, nor do we know of any specific source through which such knowledge might have been mediated. One early modern proponent of the argument with whose works Kant might have been (directly or indirectly) acquainted was the Cambridge theologian Richard Bentley (1662-1742): "For, consider the present revolution of the Earth . . . G od Almighty, if he so pleaseth, may continue this motion to perpetuity in infinite revolutions to come; because futurity is inexhaustible, and can never be spent or run out by past and pres­ ent moments. But then, if we look backwards from this present revolution, we may apprehend the impossibility of infinite revolutions on that side; be­ cause all are already past, and so were once actually present, and conse­ quently are finite . . . F or surely we cannot conceive a preteriteness (if I may say so) still backwards in infinitum, that never was present, as we can endless futurity that never will be present. So that one is potentially infi­ nite, yet nevertheless the other is actually finite" (Bentley, Sermons Preached at Boyle's Lecture [1692], ed. A. Dyce [London, 1838], p. 134).
 
 56 Compare Kant's argumentfor the "First Analogy" (especially A 188/B 2 3I) and the second-edition "Refutation of Idealism" (B 275-8 and B xxxix-xli note). The conclusion of this argument is the same as that of an ad hominem argument Leibniz presents against the Newtonian concept of absolute space (Leibniz, Correspondence with Clarke, 7:373).
 
 57 "Absolute space" is an allusion to the Newtonian theory of space (cf.
 
 "Transcendental Aesthetic," A23/B38, B 69-72, and Metaphysical First Grounds of Natural Science, 4:481).
 
 58 This "dogmatic" formulation is close to the negation of Baumgarten's de­ finition of "comparative magnitude" at Metaphysica § 16r.
 
 59 Leibniz criticized the apparent implication of the Newtonian view, that there could be infinite empty space (Leibniz, Correspondence with Clarke, 7:368).
