It’s clear that reason doesn’t assume there is a perfect being that matches the ideal, but only the idea of such a being. From this idea, reason figures out how limited, real things come from a totally complete, unlimited being. For reason, the ideal is like the original model of everything, and all real things are imperfect copies that get their potential from it. Even though they try to be like the ideal, they never fully reach it.

This means that everything possible comes from something original that includes all reality. Negatives, or things that limit something, only make sense because there’s a highest reality without limits. So, all the different things we see are just ways of limiting the perfect, unlimited reality, just like shapes only exist by limiting infinite space. That’s why reason calls this perfect idea the original being, since nothing is above it. It’s also called the highest being and the being of all beings because everything else depends on it. But this is only about ideas and concepts, not about knowing if such a perfect being actually exists.

Since an original being can’t be made up of many lesser beings (because those lesser beings depend on the original), this ideal being has to be simple and not made of parts.

Also, saying that everything else comes from this original being by breaking it into parts isn’t right. If that were true, the original being would just be a collection of lesser beings, which we said is impossible. Instead, the highest reality is the reason everything else can exist, but it’s not made up of those things. The variety we see doesn’t come from limiting the original being itself, but from what follows completely from it. All the things we experience belong to this, but they aren’t part of the idea of the highest being.
