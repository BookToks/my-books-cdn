When things happen at the same time, they are always connected in some way that we can notice.

But this connection can come with lots of different things. What really matters is that the different parts affect each other.

If nothing stayed the same all the time, there wouldn’t be a clear moment to point to in time. That means we couldn’t really notice or understand when something happens.

Also, if nothing always came before something else, then things wouldn’t have a clear order. We wouldn’t know where something fits in a sequence.

Our senses help us figure out when things happen in time. When we just see something, it’s like an appearance, but by using certain rules, we can put events in a specific order.

Kant says that this ordering means deciding if things happen one after another or at the same time. To do this, we need to believe that some objects last over time and that they cause and affect each other in certain ways.

So, we use basic ideas like “substance,” “cause,” and “interaction” to put things in order in time. Kant doesn’t fully explain why we have to use these ideas here, but he plans to do that later in a section called the “Analogies of Experience.”

Before that, he talks about why these ideas are always true based on how we understand objects and ourselves, which he calls the “Transcendental Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding.”

Some people wonder if Kant should have kept these two parts connected because his early notes didn’t separate them.

This is something readers think about when they try to understand how these two sections relate to each other.
