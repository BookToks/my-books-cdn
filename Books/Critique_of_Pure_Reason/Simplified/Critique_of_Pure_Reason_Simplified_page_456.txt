When we use pure reason wrongly, it doesn’t help us at all. But sometimes, the same idea is used when thinking about our inner experiences, even though we haven’t proven it really applies or lasts over time. So, this use is based on experience but isn’t very reliable.

To explain how all these confusing ideas about the soul connect in pure reason, we see that self-awareness uses all kinds of basic concepts. But it only focuses on certain key ideas that help keep everything united in one possible experience. These key ideas are about lasting, being real, being one thing (not many), and existing. However, reason treats all these ideas as if they are the basic conditions for a thinking being, even though they themselves don’t need anything else to explain them. So, the soul understands itself as “I” in different ways:

1. It knows itself as one whole, not just a part of something else, but as something that exists on its own.

2. It knows itself as the one thing that stays the same over time, not changing into many different things.

3. It knows itself as existing in space, not as many different things outside itself, but only as its own existence and as ideas of other things.

Later, I will explain more about how this idea of being simple connects to the idea of being real, in the next chapter when I use the same concept again.
