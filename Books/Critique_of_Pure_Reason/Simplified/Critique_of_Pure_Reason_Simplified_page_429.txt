Part II, Division Book II

I am a thinking being (a soul), and because of that, I am a substance.

We have already shown that pure ideas like "substance" don’t actually mean anything unless we connect them to something we can sense or imagine. Without that, these ideas are just empty words in a judgment.

When I say something is a substance, I mean it is different from just qualities or features. In all our thoughts, the "I" is the main thing, and thoughts are just features of the "I." The "I" itself can’t be just a feature of something else. So, everyone has to think of themselves as a substance, and their thoughts as parts or states of their being.

But what do I do with this idea of being a substance? Just because I think of myself as a thinking being doesn’t mean I can prove that I never begin or end. This idea of being a substance only helps if I can be sure I last over time. Without that, the idea isn’t very useful.

We don’t have enough to say that just the idea of substance shows that something lasts forever. Instead, we have to rely on experience to say that something keeps existing over time. But here, we didn’t use experience; we only said that all thoughts belong to the "I" as the common subject. Even if we tried to watch carefully, we couldn’t prove that the "I" lasts because the "I" is in all thoughts but doesn’t come with any clear image or sense that sets it apart from other things we imagine.

So, we can see that the idea of "I" comes back in every thought, but we can’t actually sense it as something separate or lasting on its own.
