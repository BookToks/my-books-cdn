All our knowledge starts with experience. How else could our minds begin to learn if not through things we see, hear, or feel? These things wake up our senses and help us form pictures or ideas in our minds. Then, our understanding works by comparing, connecting, or separating these ideas. This process turns raw impressions from our senses into knowledge about the world, which we call experience. So, in terms of time, no knowledge comes before experience; all knowledge begins with it.

But even though all knowledge starts with experience, it doesn’t mean that all knowledge comes only from experience. It’s possible that some parts of what we know come from our mind itself, which is triggered by what we sense. This extra part is mixed with what we get from experience, and we can’t tell the difference between them until we practice and learn to notice it.

Because of this, we need to look more closely at whether there is any kind of knowledge that doesn’t depend on experience or what we sense at all. Such knowledge is called a priori, meaning it exists before any experience. This is different from empirical knowledge, which comes from experience, called a posteriori. The term a priori isn’t always clear because sometimes we say we know something a priori even though we actually learned it from experience, but we apply it based on a general rule we got from experience.
