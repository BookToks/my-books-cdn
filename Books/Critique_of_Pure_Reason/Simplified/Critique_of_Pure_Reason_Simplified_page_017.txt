The "Doctrine of Elements" is split into two main parts, but they are very different in size. The first part is the "Transcendental Aesthetic," which looks at how our basic ways of sensing things—space and time—help us know stuff before we even experience it. The second part is the "Transcendental Logic," which looks at how our mind contributes to knowledge, both in real and fake ways.

This split comes from Baumgarten, who used the word "aesthetics" to mean the study of basic, sensory knowledge, as opposed to logic, which studies higher-level thinking. But when Kant wrote the Critique, he didn’t agree that there could be a science of taste (which is what we now call "aesthetics"). Instead, he used the word to talk about how our senses help us understand the world in general.

After explaining the difference between "general logic" (the basic science of thinking in general) and "transcendental logic" (the science of how we think about objects), Kant divides "Transcendental Logic" into two parts: the "Transcendental Analytic" and the "Transcendental Dialectic." This idea comes from an old distinction between logic about truth and logic about probability.

The "Transcendental Analytic" looks at how understanding works together with our senses to make experience and knowledge possible. The "Transcendental Dialectic," on the other hand, looks at how reason tries to go beyond what we can sense to understand things like the soul or God, but this attempt is not reliable.

The "Transcendental Analytic" itself has two books: the "Analytic of Concepts," which proves that some basic ideas in our mind, like substance and cause, are always true, and the "Analytic of Principles," which proves that the rules we use to judge things in the world, like conservation of substance and cause and effect, are also valid.

The "Transcendental Dialectic" also has two books: "On the Concepts of Pure Reason" and "On the Dialectical Inferences of Pure Reason." In these, Kant explains how pure reason creates ideas about things like the soul, the whole world, and God, and then tries to prove these ideas are real by using reasoning that works when based on our senses but fails when it goes beyond them.
