We would be happy not to demand clear answers if we understood from the start that no matter what the answer is, it would only make us more confused. It would take away one mystery but replace it with an even bigger one, leading us from one kind of confusion to another, maybe even contradictions. If our question is just answered with a “yes” or “no,” it’s smarter to first ignore the reasons for each side and think about what we would actually get if the answer were yes or no. 

If it turns out that both answers don’t really make sense, then we should carefully look at the question itself to see if it’s based on a false assumption. Sometimes the question uses an idea that seems okay when you think about it, but it actually fails when you try to apply it or look at what comes from it. This is why being skeptical about the questions reason asks itself is useful. It helps us avoid a lot of pointless arguments and replace them with careful thinking that clears up confusion and gets rid of fake knowledge.

So, if I could see in advance that any idea about the universe—no matter which way the argument goes—would always be either too big or too small for what we can really understand, then I would know that this idea is empty and meaningless. That’s because the idea is about something we can experience, but it doesn’t fit with any possible way we understand things. This is true for all the ideas about the world, which is why reason always ends up in a problem it can’t solve.

For example, if you think the world has no beginning, then it’s too big for your mind to understand. Your idea of the world is a chain of events going back forever, but you can’t really grasp that whole endless story. On the other hand, if you think the world has a beginning, then the world is too small for your idea. Because if there is a beginning, you still have to ask what came before that, since time always needs a cause before it. So, the world is too small for that rule too.
