Even the tiniest amount of something has a size or intensity that can always be made smaller. Between what’s real and what’s not, there’s a smooth range of possible realities and smaller feelings or perceptions. For example, the color red has different shades, and no matter how small the shade, there’s always a smaller one. The same goes for warmth or gravity.

This idea that no part of a size or amount is the smallest part is called continuity. Space and time are continuous because you can only think of a piece of space or time by marking its edges (like points or moments). So, space is made up of smaller spaces, and time is made up of smaller times. Points and moments are just boundaries, not actual parts of space or time. You need the idea of space or time first to understand these boundaries. Because space and time flow smoothly without breaks, we often say they “flow” or “pass.”

Everything we see or feel is continuous, either in how big it is (like the size of a shape) or how strong it is (like how hot something feels). If this smooth connection breaks, then what we have is just a bunch of separate things, not one continuous thing. For example, if I say “thirteen dollars” as one amount of money, I mean a continuous whole, like silver that can be divided into smaller coins. But if I say “thirteen round dollars,” I mean thirteen separate coins, which is just a group, not one continuous amount.

Since there has to be one whole behind any number of things, appearances as one whole are continuous. So, all appearances, whether we look at their size or their intensity, are continuous amounts.

If all changes are continuous, then everything that changes does so smoothly without sudden jumps.
