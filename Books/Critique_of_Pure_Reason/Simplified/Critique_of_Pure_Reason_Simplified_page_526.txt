The things we experience in space and time are called objects. We don’t know the real cause behind these experiences, so we can’t imagine it as an object. This cause wouldn’t be in space or time, which are needed for us to understand things.

We call this unknown cause the "transcendental object" just to have a way to think about how we receive information through our senses. This transcendental object includes all the possible things we can perceive, and it exists before we have any experience.

But the things we see or sense don’t exist on their own; they only exist as part of our experience. They are just images or ideas that represent real objects when they connect to other experiences.

So, the real things from the past exist in this transcendental object, but for me, they are real in the past only because I imagine a series of experiences following rules, like history or cause and effect. This series leads to the present moment, which feels real only because it fits into possible experiences, not because it exists by itself. Events from long ago only show how the chain of experiences can stretch back before I was born.

If I imagine all the objects that exist in all time and space, I’m not saying they exist by themselves before I experience them. Instead, I’m thinking about a possible experience that includes everything completely.

Only in this complete experience do these objects (which are just ideas) exist. Saying they exist before I experience them means I will find them as I keep having experiences starting from what I sense now. The cause of how these experiences happen and how far I can go back in them is transcendental, meaning it’s beyond what we can directly know.
