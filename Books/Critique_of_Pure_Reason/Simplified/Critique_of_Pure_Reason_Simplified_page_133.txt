People who don’t accept his type of teaching and also reject the way pure reason is examined seem to want to get rid of science completely. They want to turn serious work into something like a game, certainty into just opinions, and deep thinking into simple beliefs.

For this second edition, I wanted to take the chance to clear up as many confusing parts as possible. These confusing parts may have caused some smart people to misunderstand the book, maybe partly because of my own mistakes. I didn’t change the main ideas, the reasons behind them, or the overall plan of the book. This is because I carefully checked everything for a long time before sharing it, and also because the subject itself—pure speculative reason—is built like a clear system where every part depends on the others. If there is even a small mistake or missing part, it will show up when the system is used. I hope this system will stay the same and not need changing.

I’m not saying this because I’m proud, but because tests show that it works the same whether you start with the smallest parts and build up, or look at the whole system and break it down. Trying to change even a small part causes contradictions, not just in the system but in human reasoning in general. However, the way the ideas are explained can still be improved. That’s what I worked on in this edition. I wanted to fix misunderstandings about the Aesthetic part, especially about the idea of time; clear up confusion in the Deduction of the Concepts of Understanding; address the claim that the proofs for the Principles of Pure Understanding don’t have enough evidence; and finally, correct wrong ideas about the arguments against rational psychology.
