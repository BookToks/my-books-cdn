When thinking about the mistakes of pure reason, no one would ever think that something they already know is just a mental image could be caused by something outside themselves. According to our ideas, the real cause of what we see outside can’t be what causes the images or appearances we call matter.

Since no one really knows what causes our outer sense experiences, any claim about it has no real proof. But if some people try to improve ideas about physical influence by saying that matter is a thing on its own (not just an image of something unknown), and they argue that this outside object, which only moves, can’t cause our experiences, they say there must be a third thing linking them to make sure everything matches up.

In that case, they would have to start by assuming their idea that physical influence works a certain way, so their argument actually challenges their own beliefs, not the natural influence itself. All problems with mixing thinking stuff and physical stuff come from the wrong idea that matter is real by itself, instead of just an image in our mind connected to something we don’t know.

So, no strong argument can be made against the usual idea of physical influence. If someone thinks matter and its movement are just images, then the only problem is that the unknown thing behind our senses can’t cause these images. But this claim has no proof because no one can say what an unknown thing can or can’t do.

According to what we proved earlier, people must accept this idea that what we experience is just in our mind, unless they want to believe that these images are real things outside of us.

Still, a good critical argument can be made against the common idea of physical influence. The connection claimed between thinking things and physical things is based on a simple dualism, which wrongly treats physical things as if they are real on their own, when they are actually just images.
