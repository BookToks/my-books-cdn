No matter how we come up with these ideas, we can’t find proof that the things they describe actually exist just by thinking about them. This is because knowing something exists means believing it’s real outside of our thoughts. But it’s impossible to start with just an idea and, without using real-world experience (which only shows us appearances), discover new things or beings beyond what we can experience.

Even though pure thinking isn’t enough to prove the existence of a supreme being, it still helps a lot. It makes sure our ideas about such a being make sense and don’t contradict themselves or what we know. It also helps us remove anything that doesn’t fit with the idea of an original, all-powerful being and gets rid of anything based only on experience.

Because of this, studying pure ideas about God or a highest being is useful in a negative way—it stops us from making mistakes when thinking about these ideas without any real proof. If, in some other way, we assume there is a highest being, it’s really important to clearly understand this idea from a pure, logical point of view. This helps us get rid of wrong ideas, like thinking God has human traits, and avoid arguments from people who don’t believe in God or have different ideas about God.

This is easy to do because the reasons that show human reason can’t prove God’s existence also show why arguments against God don’t work. After all, just by thinking, who can really say there is no highest being? Or that it doesn’t have the qualities we imagine, based on what we understand about thinking beings? Or that these qualities must be limited by what we experience with our senses?
