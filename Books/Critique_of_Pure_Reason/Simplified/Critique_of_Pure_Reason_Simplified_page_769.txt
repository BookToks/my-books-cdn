Here, Kant groups rational physics and rational psychology under something he calls rational physiology. He thinks there are solid ideas in rational physics and psychology that explain the basic rules we use to judge things in these fields before we even do experiments. These ideas can replace the confusing and rejected theories of rational cosmology, psychology, and theology he talked about earlier in his "Dialectic."

Even though Kant later wrote about rational physics in his 1786 book Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, he said rational psychology (or the science of the soul) isn’t really possible. He believed that inner sense, unlike outer sense, can’t be turned into math, so we can’t have a real science about inner feelings or thoughts. But this argument is challenged by the current paragraph and Kant’s footnote. He explains that the basic principles of rational physics are different from the math rules of general physics, which are based on them. So, it’s possible to have basic rules about inner sense that help us understand cause and effect in psychology without needing math. That’s exactly what his ideas called the "Analogies of Experience" and "Refutation of Idealism" did.

In the systems made by Wolff and Baumgarten, empirical psychology was a separate part from rational psychology. Rational psychology focused on things like the soul being non-physical and living forever, while empirical psychology described what it feels like to think and have emotions. But here, Kant seems to think about Locke’s project. Locke wanted to figure out how human knowledge works by carefully studying our own thoughts and experiences, using a simple, straightforward method (see An Essay concerning Human Understanding, book I, chapter 1, section 2). Locke’s ideas influenced others, like Hume and some German thinkers such as Sulzer and Johann Nicolaus Tetens, who wrote Philosophical Attempts in 1777. Kant used their work as a model for empirical cognitive psychology and supported it with his own transcendental psychology, especially in the first edition of his work.

Leibniz compared himself and Locke with Plato and Aristotle in the introduction of his book New Essays concerning Human Understanding (page 47 in Bennett and Remnant’s translation). This book made a big impact on Kant when it was published after Leibniz died in 1765.

Kant also refers to Locke’s An Essay concerning Human Understanding, book IV, chapter X, section 1, where Locke says that the existence of God can be proven with evidence as strong as math certainty. Locke doesn’t say the same about knowing the soul lives forever, though this chapter does include an argument that matter is not eternal (section 18).
