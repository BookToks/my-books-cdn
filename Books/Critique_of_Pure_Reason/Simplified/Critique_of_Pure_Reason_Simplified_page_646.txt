This can only happen by deciding what my object is based on either real experience or pure imagination. The first way would only give me a guess based on measuring its angles, which wouldn’t be true for all cases and isn’t what we’re talking about here. The second way is through math, especially geometry, where I create a clear picture in my mind of what a triangle is. This helps me make general statements about triangles that are always true.

Thinking about a triangle just by talking or reasoning won’t get me past the simple definition I started with. Philosophers can think about things in general and how we might experience them, but math isn’t about whether something exists or not. It’s about the properties objects have based on their concepts.

We’ve tried to show the big difference between reasoning just by ideas and reasoning by creating clear mental pictures. Now the question is, why do we need these two ways to reason, and how do we know when to use just ideas or also mental pictures?

All our knowledge is connected to possible experiences because only through experiences can we know an object. A concept that isn’t based on experience might already include a clear mental picture, so it can be created in the mind. Or it might only combine possible experiences that aren’t clear at first. In that case, we can still judge based on ideas, but only by reasoning with concepts, not by creating mental pictures.

Of all mental images, only the basic shapes of space and time are given without experience.
