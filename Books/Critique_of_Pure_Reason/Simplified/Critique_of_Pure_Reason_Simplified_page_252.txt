Understanding things depends on how our mind connects what we see or experience. If we only noticed each part separately, our mind would have a bunch of random pieces with no order. So, our imagination helps us put these pieces together into a full picture. This first step of imagination, where it takes in all the impressions, is called apprehension.

But just noticing these pieces isn’t enough to make a clear image. Our mind also needs to remember past impressions and link them to new ones. This ability to bring back old images and connect them with new ones is called the reproductive part of imagination, which happens based on experience.

If our mind just remembered things randomly, it would be a mess with no real understanding. So, there are rules in how our mind connects these images, choosing to link some ideas together rather than others. This process, where ideas are connected by certain rules, is called the association of representations.

However, if these connections didn’t have a real reason outside our mind, then it would be random whether things made sense or not. Even if we could connect ideas, it wouldn’t be clear if they actually fit together to form knowledge. Without this, we’d just have lots of separate experiences in our mind that don’t belong to one clear understanding.
