Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III talks about how we think about our soul and what happens after we die. Some people try to explain the soul as one unchanging thing that thinks, based only on what they feel inside, without checking if this really makes sense with what we experience in life. This way of thinking might seem easy, but it actually messes up how we should use reason based on what we learn from real experiences.

For example, some spiritualists say that our self stays the same because it’s a single thinking thing. They also say we care about what happens after death because our mind is not physical. But they skip looking for natural reasons behind our thoughts and feelings and rely on a kind of “superior” reasoning that doesn’t match what we can actually experience. This makes their ideas comfortable for them but not very true or helpful.

This problem is even clearer when people try to explain everything in nature by saying a highest intelligence or God planned it all. They see nature’s order as proof of a smart creator and stop trying to understand how nature works through natural laws. Instead, they just say it’s all part of a mysterious plan. This stops real reasoning because it ignores the actual rules that science finds in nature.

We can avoid this mistake if we don’t just look at a few parts of nature, like mountains or animals, and say they were made for a purpose. Instead, we should look at the whole system of nature and try to see if there is a general plan that follows natural laws. Then, we can think of purpose as something that fits the universal rules of nature, not just something we guess. This way, we keep using reason based on real experience and don’t jump to conclusions without proof.
