Before we start using pure reason, we need to understand how our ideas fit together without relying on experience. If we don’t, we might get confused about how valid these ideas really are and make the idea of space unclear by using it in the wrong way. That’s why we need a special explanation of space first. The reader has to see why this explanation is necessary before going further, or else they’ll just get lost and end up back where they started. But they also need to know from the beginning that this is a hard topic, so they won’t get frustrated or think it’s unclear when things seem complicated.

When it comes to space and time, we already showed it’s pretty easy to understand how these ideas, which we know before any experience, still have to connect to real things. We can know things about space and time without needing experience because objects only appear to us through these pure ways we sense things. So, space and time are pure ways we sense that make it possible for things to appear to us, and this makes our knowledge of them valid.

But the categories of understanding work differently. They don’t explain how objects appear to us in the first place. Objects can show up in our senses without needing these categories, which means our understanding doesn’t always set the rules for what we see. This creates a problem we didn’t have with senses: how can our way of thinking have real authority over what we know about objects? For example, take the idea of cause, which means one thing happening because of another, following a rule. We can’t just say this is true because of experience; we need to prove it from the start. So, it’s not clear if this idea really applies to what we see or if it’s just empty and doesn’t connect to anything real.
