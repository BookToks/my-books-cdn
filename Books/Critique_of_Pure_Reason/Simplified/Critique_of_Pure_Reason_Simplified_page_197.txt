Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic

If people choose the first idea (which most math scientists do), they have to believe in two things that last forever and exist on their own—space and time. These things exist even if nothing real is inside them, just so we can understand everything real inside space and time.

If they pick the second idea (which some nature philosophers do), they think space and time are just ways we notice things happening one after another. These ideas come from experience but are a bit mixed up when we think about them on their own. This means they have to question if math rules that don’t depend on experience are really true about real things, like objects in space. Because on this view, space and time are just made-up ideas from experience, and they only work with the limits nature gives them.

The first idea lets us use math to talk about what we see. But if we try to understand more than what we see, it gets confusing. The second idea works better if we only think about objects in our mind, not what we see. But it can’t explain how math can work without experience, and it can’t fully connect what we experience with math rules.

Our own idea about how space and time really work fixes these problems.

Also, the transcendental aesthetic (which studies how we sense things) can only include space and time. Other ideas, like motion, need something we experience first. For example, motion needs us to see something moving. Space by itself doesn’t move, so motion must come from experience. The same goes for change; time itself doesn’t change, only things inside time do. And to notice change, we need to experience things happening over time.
