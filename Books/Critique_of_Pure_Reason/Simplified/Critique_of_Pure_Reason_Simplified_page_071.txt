Kant’s conclusion about the antinomies is different from what he will later say. He suggests that "transcendent principles" (which will become the theses later) come from using understanding without thinking about space and time. The "immanent principles" come from using understanding with space and time, following how we experience things.

But he doesn’t reject using understanding beyond space and time. In fact, like in his earlier work, he thinks there is a real way to use understanding without those limits.

He repeats three important rules:

1. Don’t judge things that aren’t part of appearances, like God, by the rules of space and time.

2. Don’t apply the conditions of outer appearance, like space and time, to things like spirit.

3. Don’t say something is impossible just because we can’t imagine it, like the idea of infinity.

Next, he lists four key ideas that we can keep as long as we follow those three rules:

a. The thinking self is simple.

b. Freedom is needed for rational actions.

c. There is an original source that connects all our thoughts.

d. Don’t mix up limiting the world based on its origin with saying the world is limited.

So, at this point, Kant seems to plan for the Critique to do three things: (1) explain space and time like in his earlier work, (2) show how concepts of understanding work only when linked to space and time for understanding appearances, and (3) still believe these concepts can give us knowledge beyond space and time when not limited by how we sense the world.
