To prove that there is a highest being, we first have to assume that all the things we can sense are given together as one big whole. The way we can tell different things apart and understand them depends on this whole being limited in some way.

In reality, we only ever experience things through our senses, and this only happens within possible experiences. So, nothing can be an object for us unless it depends on the whole set of all things we could possibly experience.

Because of a natural mistake, we often think that what is true for things we sense is true for everything in general. But this is wrong. We forget that our ideas only apply to things as we experience them, and we wrongly apply them to all things everywhere.

We then take the idea of the whole set of everything real and treat it like a single thing that contains all reality. From this, we imagine one ultimate thing that holds all the conditions for everything else to exist and be fully understood.

Even though reason really needs to assume something complete to base all its ideas on, it realizes this idea is just a fiction or an ideal. This ideal being is first thought of as an object, then treated as something real, and finally, as reason tries to unite all things, it even imagines this being as a person.

This happens because the unity of our experience doesnâ€™t come from the objects themselves but from how our mind connects all these different experiences into one understanding. So, the idea of the highest reality and the full possibility of everything seems to depend on a highest understanding or intelligence.
