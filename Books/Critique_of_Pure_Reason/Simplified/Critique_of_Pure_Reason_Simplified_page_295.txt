The main idea here is about how we can make judgments or statements that add new information and are still known before any experience—these are called synthetic judgments a priori.

For us to truly know something, it has to be connected to an object or experience. If it’s not, then the ideas are empty and don’t really teach us anything. Just thinking without any connection to real things is like playing with ideas without meaning.

To really know an object, we need to relate our ideas to our experiences, either actual or possible. Even basic ideas like space and time, which we understand without experience, only have meaning because they help us organize what we experience. Without this, they would just be empty concepts.

Experience itself is what gives all our knowledge real meaning before we even have it. Experience depends on putting together what we perceive in a way that makes sense, following rules that connect everything in our mind. Without this, we’d just have random feelings and no real understanding.

There are basic rules that guide how we combine what we see and feel, and these rules are necessary for experience to be possible. Without these rules, it would be impossible to make synthetic judgments a priori because there would be no real object to connect our ideas to.

So, even though we can understand things like space and shapes without experience, this understanding would be useless if space wasn’t seen as a real condition for objects to exist. Otherwise, it would just be like imagining things with no connection to reality.
