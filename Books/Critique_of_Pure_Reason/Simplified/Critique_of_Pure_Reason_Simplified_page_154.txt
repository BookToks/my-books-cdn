Now since B 10 this procedure does yield a real priori cognition, which makes secure a and useful progress, reason, without itself noticing it, under these pretenses surreptitiously makes assertions of quite another sort, in which reason adds something entirely alien to given concepts and indeeda does so priori, without one knowing how it was able to do this and without a such ab question even being allowed to come to mind. I will therefore deal with the distinction between these two sorts of cognition right at the outset.
 
 Iv.c On the difference between analytic and synthetic judgments.
 
 14 In all judgments in which the relation of a subject to the predicate is thought (if I consider only affirmative judgments, since the application to negative ones is easy) this relation is possible in two different ways.
 
 Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A as something that is (covertly) contained in this concept A; or B lies entirely outside the con: ceptA, though to be sure it stands in connection with it. In the first case I call the judgment analytic, in the second synthetic. Analytic judg- A 7 ments (affirmative ones) are thus those in which the connection of the predicate is thought through identity, but those in which this connection is thought without identity are to be called synthetic judgments.
 
 One could also call the former judgments of clarification, and the lat- B II ter judgments of amplification/ since through the predicate the former do not add anything to the concept of the subject, but only break it up by means of analysis into its component concepts, which were already thought in it (though confusedly); while the latter, on the contrary, add to the concept of the subject a predicate that was not thought in it at all, and could not have been extracted from it through any analysis. E.g., ifI say: "All bodies are extended," then this is an analytic judgment. For I do not need to go beyonde the concept that I combine with the body! in order to find that extension is connected with it, but rather I need only to analyze that concept, i.e., become conscious of the manifold that I always think in it, in order to encounter this predicate therein; it is therefore an analytic judgment. On the contrary, if I say: a The second edition adds the words "und zwar." The second edition replaces "diese" with "eine salehe." b , Section number "IV" added in the second edition.
 
 "Erliiuterungs-" and "Erweiterungsurteile." d , The second edition reads "uber" instead of "aus." f The second e�ition reads "dem Kijrper" instead of "dem Wort Kfjrper." 141 Introduction <B> "All bodies are heavy," then the predicate is something entirely differ­ ent from that which I think in the mere concept of a body in general.
