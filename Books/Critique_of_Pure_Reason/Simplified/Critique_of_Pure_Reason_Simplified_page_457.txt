Reason is the ability to understand basic ideas. Pure psychology doesn’t talk about the soul based on experience but instead talks about ideas that should be true on their own, without needing any experience. These ideas are based on basic principles and general thoughts about thinking in general.

It turns out that one idea, "I am," is the most important and controls all these ideas. Because it shows what is common in all my experiences, it seems like a universal truth that applies to every thinking being. Even though it is unique to each person, it feels like an absolute truth that goes beyond any experience we can have.

The statement "I think" is the basis for all judgments and ideas, and it is connected to all categories of understanding. This means that when we use this idea, we are using pure understanding without any experience mixed in. But as we have seen, using understanding this way doesn’t give us very good results.
