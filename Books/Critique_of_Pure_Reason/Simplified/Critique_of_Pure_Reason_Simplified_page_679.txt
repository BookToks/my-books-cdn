Experts have tried many times to prove a certain idea, but they haven’t succeeded. Since they couldn’t give up on this idea, they chose to rely on common sense instead. This was like a last resort because it showed that reason was struggling. People didn’t want to try new, strict proofs until a new way of thinking, called the transcendental critique, came along.

If you want to prove something based only on pure reason, and even go beyond what we can experience by using ideas alone, then the proof must explain why this is okay. For example, some try to prove that our thinking is simple and united because we are aware of ourselves as one. But this is tricky because the idea of being absolutely simple isn’t something we can directly see or experience. It’s just something we guess or imagine.

Think about it like this: if I imagine the force of my moving body, it feels like one simple thing to me. I can even picture it as a single moving point without size, and that’s okay. But that doesn’t mean the whole body is simple just because I imagine it that way. The problem is confusing the simple idea in our minds with the simple thing itself. The "I," or soul, might seem simple at first, but it actually includes many complex parts.

To even start understanding this confusion, we need a clear way to check if these kinds of ideas can really work. This way is to see if the proof can connect what we know with what we want to prove, not directly, but by showing how we can expand our ideas in a logical way before we experience them.
