Learning new things is really exciting, and usually, the only thing that can stop you is running into a clear problem that can’t be solved. But if you’re careful with your ideas, you can avoid these problems, even if your ideas are new and different. Math is a great example of how much we can understand just by thinking, without needing to see or experience things first.

Right now, math deals only with things we can imagine clearly. This might be easy to miss because the way we imagine these things can be created just by thinking, so it feels like we’re dealing with pure ideas, not just guesses.

Seeing how powerful thinking can be makes us want to keep pushing further and further. Imagine a bird flying through the air and feeling the wind pushing against it—then thinking it could fly even better in space, where there’s no air. That’s like what the philosopher Plato did. He left behind the world we see and feel because it seemed too confusing, and he tried to understand things using only pure ideas. But he didn’t realize that without real-world challenges to test his ideas, he wasn’t really making progress. 

People often build their ideas quickly and then only check later if their foundation is solid. At that point, they try to find reasons to prove their ideas are strong or avoid checking because it feels risky. What makes us feel confident during this building is that a lot of thinking involves breaking down ideas we already have. This helps us see things more clearly, but it doesn’t actually add anything new—it just sorts out what we already know.

Since this process does give us real knowledge by thinking alone, our minds sometimes sneak in new ideas without us realizing how or why. This happens without us even questioning it. Because of this, I will start by explaining the difference between these two kinds of knowledge right away.
