A transcendental paralogism is a kind of mistake that happens because of the way our thinking works. It causes us to believe something wrong, but this mistake is hard to avoid, even if we can’t completely fix it.

Now, there is an important idea called "I think" that wasn’t listed before with other big ideas about how we understand things. This idea is special because it helps us understand all other ideas, including those big, deep ones. It’s always part of how we think, but it doesn’t have its own special name because it just helps us connect all the other ideas.

There’s a question about whether, when I understand something using pure thinking (without any real details), I really know it or just have a kind of empty idea about it. Also, whether these ideas can come from what we sense or if they are just part of how we think by nature. And if using these ideas helps us learn more.

A paralogism is a kind of wrong argument that looks correct but isn’t. Usually, it has a general statement at the start, but here, the main idea is about one thing and includes a statement that is true by itself. So, the argument only talks about two things and is misleading.

These wrong arguments start with the idea "I exist" and try to show that I am a simple thing that stays the same over time. They say my existence isn’t just about time, which is something we experience, but something deeper.

When we say "I exist," we mean that I am a simple, constant thing. To understand other things, we need to notice their qualities through our senses, over time, and in space. But when it comes to myself, it’s like I already know these basic ideas without needing to sense them first.
