The idea of a moral world is real, but not like something we can see or imagine clearly. Instead, it relates to the world we live in. It exists as a concept in our reason when we think about how people make free choices following moral rules. These choices connect in a system, both within themselves and with everyone else’s freedom.

This answers the first big question about how to act to become worthy of happiness. The second question is: if I behave in a way that makes me worthy of happiness, can I expect to actually be happy? To answer this, we need to know if the rules of pure reason link our hope for happiness with being moral.

I say that just like moral rules are necessary for practical reasons, it’s also necessary to believe that everyone has a reason to hope for happiness based on how morally worthy they are. So, the system of morality and the idea of happiness are closely connected, but only as an idea in pure reason.

In a perfect moral world, where nothing stops people from being moral, this connection between morality and happiness would be real. Freedom, guided by moral laws, would cause general happiness. People would create good outcomes for themselves and others by following these principles. But this idea of morality leading to self-reward is only a concept. It depends on everyone doing what they should, as if all actions come from one highest will that controls all choices.

Even though the moral law applies to each person’s freedom, no matter what others do, how actions affect happiness isn’t decided by the nature of things or by the cause-and-effect of the actions themselves.
