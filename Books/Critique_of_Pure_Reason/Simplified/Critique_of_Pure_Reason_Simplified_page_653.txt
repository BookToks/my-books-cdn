Chapter 1, Section 1

People might think about this carefully. Even though nothing wrong happens in what it says, sometimes, but very rarely, there can be a small mistake in how it’s explained, especially about being exact. For example, when people say a circle is a curved line where every point is the same distance from one center point, they make a mistake by adding the word “curved” for no reason. It should be a special rule that we can figure out from the definition and prove that any line with points all the same distance from one spot has to be curved and can’t be straight anywhere. 

On the other hand, definitions that try to explain things by breaking them down can make many mistakes. They might include things that don’t really belong or leave out important parts. This is because it’s hard to be 100% sure that the explanation covers everything. That’s why the way math defines things can’t be copied exactly in philosophy.

2. About axioms. These are basic ideas we know are true right away without needing proof. But you can’t just connect one idea to another instantly without thinking about something else first. Since philosophy is just thinking using ideas, it doesn’t have any real axioms.

Math, however, does have axioms. For example, three points always lie on the same flat surface, because math lets us build ideas with pictures or shapes in our minds, connecting things immediately. But some principles, like “everything that happens has a cause,” aren’t instantly clear just by thinking. You always need to think about something else, like time or experience, before you understand them. So, principles you figure out step-by-step are very different from the ones you just see right away, like math axioms.

The step-by-step principles always need proof, but axioms don’t. Axioms are obvious and sure, while philosophical principles, even if certain, can’t claim to be obvious. Any complex idea you get just by thinking is much less clear than something simple like “two times two is four.” I did think about some basic rules in my work on understanding, but those were not axioms themselves. They just helped explain how axioms could even exist, and they were still based on ideas. Even math’s possibility has to be explained in a special way in philosophy.
