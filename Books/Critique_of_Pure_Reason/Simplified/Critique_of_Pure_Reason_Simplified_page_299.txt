In this part, I am not talking about the rules of math or physics. Instead, I’m focusing on the basic ideas we use to understand things inside our mind, especially how we sense things within ourselves. These ideas make it possible for other rules to work. That’s why I name them based on how we use them, not what they actually say. Now, I will explain them in the order they appear in the list.

1.

<Axioms of Intuition.> The main idea here is: All things we see or experience have size and take up space.

All appearances we notice have a shape in space and time. This idea is the foundation for all our experiences. Sometimes we combine things that don’t naturally belong together, like two triangles inside a square. This kind of combination is called aggregation and deals with things that take up space.

Other times, things combine because they have to, like an effect happening because of a cause. This second kind of combination is called dynamical because it involves how different parts actually exist together. This can be about physical things happening in the world or how our mind understands them before we experience them.
