Chapter 2, Section 2

We have to imagine a perfect world where everything fits together based on pure but practical reason. This perfect world isn’t the one we see with our senses, because the real world around us doesn’t show such a clear, organized plan. The only way to believe in this kind of perfect order is to assume there is a highest original good, a supreme cause that sets everything right and keeps the whole system working perfectly, even if we can’t always see it.

Moral theology, which deals with right and wrong, has an advantage over speculative theology, which is more about guessing and theories. Moral theology leads us to believe in one perfect, rational being who started everything. Speculative theology can’t prove this, or even give a good clue about it. When we look at nature and reason alone, we don’t find a good reason to believe in a single being controlling everything.

But if we think about the world from a moral point of view, there has to be one supreme will behind it all. This will includes all the laws of the world and makes them binding for us. How could many different wills work together perfectly? This one will must be all-powerful, knowing everything inside us, always present to help, and eternal, so that nature and freedom always work together smoothly.

This perfect plan, where freedom and nature fit together, creates a moral world, which is different from the world we just see with our senses. It shows that everything in the world has a purpose and follows universal laws of nature and morality. This joins practical reason (how we act) with speculative reason (how we understand things).

To make sense of this, the world must come from an idea—a highest good that guides everything. Without this idea, we wouldn’t be worthy of using reason in a moral way. So, all our study of nature should focus on seeing it as a system full of purpose and meaning.
