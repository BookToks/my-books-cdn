This critique is meant to prepare, if possible, a tool or a set of rules that can help us understand the whole system of pure reason. Whether this system grows bigger or is limited, one day it should be possible to show it clearly in two ways: by breaking it down and by putting it together.

We can hope to finish this system because we are not studying the endless nature of things, but the understanding that judges about things. This understanding works based on knowledge we have before experience, which doesn’t come from outside us. This kind of knowledge is probably small enough that we can list it all, judge if it’s good or bad, and understand it well.

Also, this critique is not about judging books or systems of pure reason, but about judging pure reason itself. Only by doing this can we have a solid way to judge old and new philosophical works. Otherwise, people just judge others without a solid base, using their own weak ideas.

Transcendental philosophy is the idea of a science that the critique of pure reason plans out completely, based on principles. It promises to cover all parts of this system fully and correctly. It is the system of all principles of pure reason. 

This critique is not called transcendental philosophy itself because a full system would also have to include a complete study of all human knowledge before experience. Our critique lists all the main ideas that make up this pure knowledge but stops short of fully analyzing these ideas or their details. 

This is partly because such a full analysis isn’t needed for our main goal, which is to understand how these ideas come together. Also, doing a full analysis would go against our plan’s unity and would be a big task that isn’t necessary for what we want to achieve.
