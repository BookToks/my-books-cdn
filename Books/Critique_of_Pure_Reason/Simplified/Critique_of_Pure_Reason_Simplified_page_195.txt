Part I. The Transcendental Aesthetic

This part talks about how time and space come from how we experience things, not from the things themselves. They don’t exist on their own without us noticing them.

Time and space are different from feelings or sensations because those rely on things actually happening. But time and space are just ways we understand things, not things we can touch or see by themselves.

Some people argue about whether time is real or just something we imagine. They say changes happen, and changes need time, so time must be real.

I agree that time is real, but only as a way we understand what’s happening inside our minds. Time is like a tool our brain uses to organize how we see ourselves and our thoughts.

If we could see ourselves without this way of feeling time, we wouldn’t notice time passing or changes happening. So, time is real for how we experience things, but it’s not something that exists on its own outside of us.

Time doesn’t belong to objects or things themselves. It’s just how we arrange our thoughts and experiences in order.
