59 Kant uses the Latin word "intuitus" to mean the immediate and unique ideas we get from our senses. You can see this in his dissertation called De mundi sensibilis atque intelligibilis forma et principiis (On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World), sections 1, 10, 14-3, and 15.C. Later, in his Critique of Pure Reason, he uses the German word "Anschauung" for the same idea. Because Kant first used the Latin word, his German word is usually translated as "intuition." Some people don't like this translation because "intuition" can mean other things in English. But it's better to keep the traditional translation and remember that Kant’s meaning depends on what he says, not on other meanings of the word.

62 At first, Kant uses the word "noumena" in a way that the Critique later forbids, called the "positive" sense, instead of the allowed "negative" sense (B 307). It’s hard to say if Kant ever completely removes the positive meaning of "noumena" from the Critique, especially in his "Antinomy of Pure Reason" argument.

63 Pierre Bayle talked about many of these paradoxes in his article on "Zeno of Elea" in his famous Historical and Critical Dictionary, first published in 1687. You can find a translation in Pierre Bayle, Historical and Critical Dictionary, translated by Richard H. Popkin (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Co., 1991), pages 350-88. Bayle’s article influenced Berkeley, who wrote about these paradoxes in his Principles of Human Knowledge, for example section 118. Berkeley’s ideas about infinite paradoxes might have influenced Hume too, especially in his Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, section XII, part II.
