Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III talks about how we can only connect different experiences of things by using an idea that helps organize them. This idea doesn’t actually create or prove anything real by itself; it just helps guide how we think about things.

When we imagine something that matches this idea, like a real being or “Something,” it doesn’t mean we know more about actual things beyond what we experience. This “being” exists only in the idea, not in real life, and it helps us organize our thoughts without telling us what this being really is or what causes it.

So, the idea of God that reason gives us is more like a thought or concept, not proof that God really exists. Reason doesn’t give us solid proof that such a being is real. Instead, it gives us an idea of something that everything else depends on, like a cause of all things that follows the rules of reason. This only makes sense if we try to think of God as a real object, but many people just use the idea as a helpful rule for thinking and don’t try to prove it exists. However, if we want perfect understanding, reason doesn’t want to stop here.

If I assume there is a divine being, I don’t really understand how it could exist or why it must exist. But even without this, I can still figure out other questions about things that might or might not exist. Reason can be satisfied with the best possible unity it finds in experience, but not with the assumption itself. This shows that reason is interested in exploring big ideas beyond what it really knows, rather than having clear proof.

Here, a difference appears between two ways of thinking that is important for philosophy. I can have a good reason to assume something in a limited way (relatively), but that doesn’t mean I have a good reason to assume it absolutely or completely.

This difference matters when we only deal with ideas that help guide us.
