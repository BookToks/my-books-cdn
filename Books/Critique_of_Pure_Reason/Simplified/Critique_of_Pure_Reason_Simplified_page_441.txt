Part II, Book II, Section B

Something outside us, in a deep, philosophical way, causes our outer experiences. But this isn’t the same as the object we think of when we imagine matter or physical things. Those are just appearances, or ways our mind shows us things. These appearances only exist inside us, just like our own thoughts, and their reality depends on us being aware of them.

We don’t really know the true object, whether it’s inside or outside us. But here, we’re talking about the objects we experience, called empirical objects. If they seem to be in space, we call them external objects. If they’re only related to time, we call them inner objects. Both space and time exist only in our minds.

The idea of “outside us” can be confusing. Sometimes it means something that really exists apart from us, and sometimes it just means something that appears outside us. To avoid confusion, we’ll call objects “external” only if they are things we find in space.

Space and time are basic ways we understand things, and they exist in us before we even experience anything real. But for something to be real in space, it must be something we can perceive. We can’t just imagine it and say it’s real in space without actually sensing it.

Sensation is what shows us that something is real in space and time. If we have a sensation but don’t focus on it as a specific object, that’s called perception. With perception, we get the material we need to think about objects we sense. We can imagine many things that don’t really exist in space or time, but real perception comes from actual sensations, like colors or warmth.

So, perception is how we represent something real in space. Space itself is just the idea of how things can exist together. But perception connects this idea to something real we experience.
