Some people, mostly students of math and mechanics, believe that a big space must be empty inside, even if the amount of emptiness changes. But did they ever realize that this idea is based on a kind of guess about how things really are in space? They assume that what’s really there in space is always the same, just in different amounts. This idea isn’t based on real experience but is just a guess.

I have a different way to prove this, called a transcendental proof. It won’t explain why space sometimes seems more or less filled, but it shows that we don’t have to assume there are empty spaces to explain these differences. This proof also allows us to think about it differently if we need to guess to understand nature.

For example, equal spaces can be completely filled with different things so that matter is everywhere in that space. But everything real has a certain quality, like resistance or weight, which can get smaller and smaller without changing the size of the space. It can get so small that it turns into emptiness and disappears.

So, something like warmth, or any other real thing we see, can fill a space without leaving any part empty. It can also become less strong and still fill the space as well as something stronger does. I’m not saying this is exactly how weight or matter really works, but I want to show that our way of understanding can allow this idea. It’s wrong to think that what’s real in space is always the same in strength and only changes by how much of it there is, especially if this is assumed without real proof.

Still, anyone who carefully thinks about this should find this idea surprising. They should also be cautious about thinking the mind can predict something like how strong everything real in space can be, and whether this kind of prediction is really possible.
