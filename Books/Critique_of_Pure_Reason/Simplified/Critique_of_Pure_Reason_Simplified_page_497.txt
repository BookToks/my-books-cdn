It is also necessary to assume another causality through freedom in order to explain them.
 
 Proof Assume that there is no other causality than that in accordance with laws of nature: then everything that happens presupposes a previous state, upon which it follows without exception according to a rule. But now the previous state itself must be something that has happened (come to be in a time when it previously was not), since if it had been at every time, then its consequence could not have just arisen, but would always have been. Thus the causality of the cause through which something happens is always something that has happened, which ac­ cording to the law of nature presupposes once again a previous state and its causality, and this in the same way a still earlier state, and so on. If, therefore, everything happens according to mere laws of nature, then at A446/ B474 every time there is only a subordinate but never a first beginning, and thus no completeness of the series on the side of the causes descending one from another. But now the law of nature consists just in this, that nothing happens without a cause sufficiently determined a priori. Thus the proposition that all causality is possible only in accordance with laws of nature, when taken in its unlimited universality, contradicts itself, and therefore this causality cannot be assumed to be the only one.
 
 Accordingly, a causality must be assumed through which something happens without its cause being further determined by another previ­ ous cause, i.e., an absolute causal spontaneity beginning from itselfb a series of appearances that runs according to natural laws, hence tran­ scendental freedom, without which even in the course of nature the se­ ries of appearances is never complete on the side of the causes.
