We need to think about another kind of cause that comes from freedom to explain things.

Imagine if everything that happens is caused only by natural laws: then every event depends on something that happened before it. But the thing that happened before must also have started at some point, because if it had always existed, then its result would have always existed too.

This means that every cause comes from another cause that happened earlier, which also has its own cause before it, and so on. So, if everything follows natural laws, there is no first cause or starting point—just an endless chain of causes.

Natural laws say that nothing happens without a clear cause. But if all causes depend on earlier causes forever, this idea contradicts itself. So, natural laws can’t be the only kind of cause.

Therefore, we have to accept that some causes happen by themselves, without needing an earlier cause. This kind of cause is free and starts things on its own. Without this freedom, the chain of causes would never truly begin or be complete, even in nature.

Some people argue that there is no freedom and everything happens only by natural laws.
