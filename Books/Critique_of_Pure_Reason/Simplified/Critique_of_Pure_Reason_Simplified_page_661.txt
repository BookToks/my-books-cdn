Like everything in nature, people have a natural tendency to do good things. Part of this is that they often try to hide what they really feel and pretend to be better than they are. Because of this, humans have not only taught themselves to act civilized but also started to become more moral. Nobody can see through the mask of respectability, honor, and proper behavior, so people learn to improve themselves by copying the good examples they see around them.

But this habit of pretending to be better only helps at first. It gets people out of being rough and allows them to act like the good people they admire. Later on, when real goodness starts to grow inside them, they have to fight against this pretending because if they don’t, it will hurt their hearts and real goodness won’t grow.

I’m sad to see the same kind of dishonesty and pretending even when people talk about their ideas, where it would be easier to just be honest and open.

What’s worse than sharing false ideas, hiding doubts about what you say, or pretending your reasons are stronger than they really are? When this happens because of personal pride, others usually stop it by saying what’s true, and things end up where they should be, but it would have happened faster if people were honest from the start.

But if the public thinks that tricky people want to harm the common good, it might seem okay to use false reasons to protect what’s good, instead of admitting you don’t have full proof. Still, I believe nothing is more harmful to a good cause than lying, tricking, and cheating.
