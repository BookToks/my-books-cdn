In the part above, when we showed the table of categories, we didn’t give definitions for each one. That’s because our goal was only to use them together, so defining each wasn’t needed. It’s smart not to try to fully explain something if you don’t have to.

But there’s a deeper reason for this. We actually couldn’t define them properly even if we wanted to. If you take away all the ways we sense things that make these concepts useful for experience, and think of them as ideas about things in general, then you’re just looking at how logic works with judgments. But you can’t really show how these ideas apply to real things or have meaning without using our senses.

For example, no one can define the idea of “magnitude” in a simple way except by saying it’s how we figure out how many units something has. This “how many times” idea depends on repeating something over time.

Reality, which is the opposite of something not being real, can only be explained if you think about time as a total space that is either full or empty of being.

Here, by a “real definition,” I mean one that doesn’t just use other words to describe something, but gives a clear way to always recognize the thing itself, so the concept can be used properly.

A real definition not only makes a concept clear but also shows what is real about it. For example, math definitions do this by showing the object in a way we can picture or understand clearly.
