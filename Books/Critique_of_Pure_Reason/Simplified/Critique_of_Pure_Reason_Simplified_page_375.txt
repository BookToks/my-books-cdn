If I don’t use any kind of experience or feeling, then what’s left is just the way we think about things, like how we decide what an object is based on possible experiences. So, these ideas go beyond just what we can sense because they think about objects in general, without focusing on how we might actually experience them. But this doesn’t mean we know more objects exist since we can’t assume there’s another kind of experience besides what we can sense, and we have no good reason to believe that.

A tricky idea is one that doesn’t have any contradictions but still connects to other knowledge we can’t really prove is real. For example, the idea of a "noumenon" means a thing that isn’t something we can sense but something that exists by itself, understood only by pure thinking. This idea isn’t contradictory because we can’t say that sensing is the only way to experience things. Also, this idea helps us remember not to confuse what we sense with things as they really are, and it limits how far our sensible knowledge can go. Things we can’t sense are called noumena just to show that our knowledge based on senses doesn’t cover everything our mind can think about.

In the end, though, we don’t really know if these noumena can exist. Outside what we can sense, the world might be empty for us. Our understanding can think beyond what we sense, but we don’t have any experience or even an idea of experience that would let us know about objects beyond what we can sense. So, the idea of a noumenon is just a kind of boundary to keep us from thinking our senses tell us everything. It’s a negative idea—it limits what we claim to know—but it isn’t made up randomly. It’s connected to the limits of what we can sense, even though we can’t say anything positive about what’s beyond those limits.

Because of this, dividing objects into things we can sense (phenomena) and things we can’t (noumena), or dividing the world into a world we sense and a world we understand, isn’t really allowed in a positive way. We can’t say for sure that the world of understanding exists independently since we can’t point to any object for it, so we can’t treat it as definitely real.
