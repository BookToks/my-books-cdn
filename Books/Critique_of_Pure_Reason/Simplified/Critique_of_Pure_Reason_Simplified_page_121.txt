The history of this rev­ olution in the way of thinking -which was far more important than the discovery of the way around the famous CapeII-and of the lucky one who brought it about, has not been preserved for us. But the leg­ end handed down to us by Diogenes Laertius -who names the reputed inventor of the smallest elements of geometrical demonstra­ tions, even of those that, according to common judgment, stand in no need of proof -proves that the memory of the alteration wrought by the discovery of this new path in its earliest footsteps must have seemed exceedingly important to mathematicians, and was thereby rendered unforgettable. A new light broke upon the first person who demonstrated the isoscelesa triangle (whether he was called "Thales" or had some other name). 12 For he found that what he had to do was Bxii not to trace what he saw in this figure, or even trace its mere con­ cept, and read off, as it were, from the properties of the figure; but rather that he had to produce the latter from what he himself thought into the object and presented (through construction) according to a priori concepts, and that in order to know something securely priori a he had to ascribe to the thing nothing except what followed nec­ essarily from what he himself had put into it in accordance with its concept.
 
 It took natural science much longer to find the highway of science; for it is only about one and a half centuries since the suggestion of the ingenious Francis Bacon partly occasioned this discovery and partly fur­ ther stimulated it, since one was already on its tracks -which discovery, therefore, can just as much be explained by a sudden revolution in the way of thinking. Here I will consider natural science only insofar as it is grounded on empirical principles.b When Galileo'3 rolled balls of a weight chosen by himself down an inclined plane, or when Torricelli'4 made the air bear a weight that he had previously thought to be equal to that of a known column of water, or when in a later time Stahl's changed metals into calxc and then Bxiii changed the latter back into metal by first removing something and a Kant's text reads "gleichseitig" (equilateral); but on the basis of his correction in a letter to Schutz of 2 5 June 1787 (ro:466), he appears to have meant "gleichschenklig" (isosceles).
 
 b Principien , Kalk. Kemp Smith translates this as "oxides," but that is anachronistic; prior to the chemical revolution of Priestley and Lavoisier, the calx was conceived to be what was left of a metal after its phlogiston had been driven off; only later was it discovered that this process was actually one of oxidation.
 
 108 to the second edition <B> then putting it back again,* a light dawned on all those who study na­ ture.
