The history of this big change in thinking—which was way more important than just finding a new way around the famous Cape—has not been saved for us. But a story from Diogenes Laertius, who talks about the person who invented the smallest parts of geometry proofs (even the ones people thought didn’t need proof), shows that this change was super important to mathematicians and was never forgotten.

A new idea came to the first person who proved the isosceles triangle (whether his name was Thales or something else). He realized that instead of just copying what he saw or even just copying the idea, he had to create it from his own thinking. He had to build the shape in his mind first and only believe what logically followed from that idea.

It took natural science much longer to find this new way of thinking. It was only about 150 years ago when the smart guy Francis Bacon helped start this discovery and pushed it forward. This discovery was also a big change in how people thought.

For example, when Galileo rolled balls he chose down a slope, or when Torricelli made air hold a weight he thought was equal to a known water column, or when later Stahl changed metals into something called calx and then turned it back again by removing something, people studying nature suddenly had a new understanding.
