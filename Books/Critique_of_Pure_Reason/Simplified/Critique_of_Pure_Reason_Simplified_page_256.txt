Understanding things depends on certain rules that our mind uses. These rules make it possible for us to experience the world in an organized way. Even though we see many different things, they all follow some basic patterns our mind uses to make sense of them.

Our mind uses categories, which are like rules, to put all these different experiences together. These rules allow us to have experiences that make sense, not just random stuff. The goal was to explain how our mind connects what we feel with what we understand, and how this connection lets us have real knowledge about the world.

To sum it up, these rules in our mind are special and necessary for us to understand anything at all.

If the things we know about were real objects by themselves, we couldn’t have any knowledge about them before experiencing them. Because where would that knowledge come from? If we got it from the objects, then it would only be based on experience, not something we know beforehand. If we got it from ourselves, what’s inside us can’t explain why there is a real object outside of our thoughts. But if everything we know is just appearances or how things seem to us, then it makes sense that some knowledge comes before experience. These appearances happen inside us since the changes we feel don’t exist outside us by themselves.

Also, the fact that all these appearances happen inside me shows that they are connected in a single, unified way in my mind. To know an object, our mind has to bring together all these different feelings and ideas as one thing. This unity in our thinking is what helps us understand the world around us.
