Part of what causes changes has to do with time, and because time only exists in the world we can see and experience, the cause has to be connected to that world. So, something absolutely necessary exists within the world itself—either the whole world or part of it.

Now, to prove that a necessary being exists, I have to use a certain kind of argument called the cosmological argument. This argument starts with things we see and moves to the idea that there must be something unchanging behind everything. Another kind of proof, which focuses on the idea of a being greater than all others, is different and needs its own explanation.

The cosmological argument can only show that a necessary being exists, but it can’t say for sure if this being is the world itself or something separate from it. To figure that out, you would need different ideas that go beyond just what we see and experience, and that’s a bigger topic for another time.

If you start with the cosmological argument based on what we can observe, you have to keep using only those observations. You can’t suddenly switch to something outside of what we see. Since conditions and causes are connected to what we experience through our senses and time, the necessary being has to be part of the world we know, like the most important part of the series of causes.

Even so, some people have tried to make that switch anyway.
