A concept has to include what the object it represents has. This is what it means when we say "an object is contained under a concept." For example, the idea of a plate has something in common with the pure idea of a circle because both include the idea of roundness.

Now, pure ideas that come from understanding are very different from ideas based on what we sense or experience. Pure ideas can’t be found in any actual experience or sense.

Kant wrote some notes about this. He said we can’t think of any experiences or relationships of experiences for the categories (basic ideas of understanding). Instead, these have to come from actual experience. All rules about understanding only apply to what we can experience, and experience is only possible because our understanding works in a certain unified way.

He also said we can’t fully understand these categories because we can’t fully see how our mind unifies our experiences. He compared the way we understand time to a line.

Kant explained that ideas like cause and effect can’t be known just by thinking; we can only know them through experience combined with our understanding.

Finally, he said that the mind’s work is called “synthesis of understanding” when it organizes our inner sense (how we feel things inside) in a way that keeps all our experiences connected.
