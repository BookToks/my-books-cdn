e., the concept must contain that which is represented in the object that is to be sub­ sumed under it, for that is just what is meant by the expression "an ob­ ject is contained under a concept." Thus the e pirical concept of a m plate has homogeneity with the pure geometrical concept of a circle, for the roundness that is tho ght in the former can be intuited in the u latter.
 
 Now pure concepts of the understanding, however, in comparison with empirical (indeed in general sensible) intuitions, are entirely un­ homogeneous, and can never be encountered in any intuition. Now n The following notes pertaining to the general argument of the next section are all in­ serted on A I 3 7 in Kant's copy of the first edition : "We cannot think any intuitions or relations [Verhiiltni.l:,e] of intuitions for the cate­ gories, rather they must be given in experience. Thus all principles pertain merely to possible experience, since this is possible only in accordance with the form of the unity of understanding." (E LUI, p. 27; 23: 27) "The incomprehensibility of the categories sterns from the fact that we cannot have insight into the synthetic unity of apperception." (E LIv, p. 27; 23:27) "The schema of time a line." (E LV; p. 27; 23:27) "The possibility of an object [Objects] of the concept of the understanding, e.g., a cause or alf1tntcrciult,t c a nnot be thought a priori, consequently only an experience can be thought with the conditions under which it can become experience in combination with the concept of the understanding." (E LVI, p. 27; 23:27) b Kant's copy of the first edition adds this note: "The synthesis of the understanding is call ed thus if it determines the inner sense in accordance with the unity of appercep­ tion." (E LVII, p. 27; 23:27) 271 Doctrine of Elements.
