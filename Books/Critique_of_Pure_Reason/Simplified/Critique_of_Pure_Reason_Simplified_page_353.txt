Even if we are given certain ideas, it doesn’t seem enough just to explain what is true. We also want to understand what we are curious about. If, after careful study, we only learn what we would have learned just by everyday experience, then the effort might not seem worth it.

But someone might say that being too worried about how useful something is before we even study it can stop us from learning new things. There is one clear benefit that even the least interested student can see: using our understanding only in everyday ways is fine, but it can’t help us figure out its own limits or what it can and can’t understand. For that, you need deep study.

If the mind can’t tell whether some questions are inside its reach or not, it can never be sure about what it knows. This means it will often make mistakes by trying to answer things it can’t really understand, getting confused and fooled.

The mind can only use its basic ideas based on experience, not in a way that goes beyond what we can experience. This is important. Using an idea in a “transcendental” way means relating it to things by themselves, not just to what we can experience. But we can only use ideas based on experience because every idea needs two things: the general way of thinking about it, and the chance to connect it to something real that we can experience. Without that, the idea has no real meaning.
