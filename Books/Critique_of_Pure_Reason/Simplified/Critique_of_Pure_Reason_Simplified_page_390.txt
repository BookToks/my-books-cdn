When you add one true thing to another, the positive part gets bigger, and nothing is taken away or canceled. So, real things can't really go against each other.

Some ideas about how we think have been misunderstood. Because of this, even a very smart philosopher was tricked into thinking that we can know things just by thinking, without using our senses. That’s why it’s really helpful to explain why these ideas are confusing and can lead to wrong beliefs. This helps us understand the limits of what our mind can know.

It’s true that if something matches or goes against a general idea, it also matches or goes against all the specific things under that idea. But it would be wrong to say that if something isn’t in the general idea, then it’s also not in the specific things under it. Specific things actually have more details than the general idea. Leibniz’s whole way of thinking is based on this wrong idea, so his system doesn’t work well and causes confusion.

The idea called the principle of indiscernibles says that if you can’t find a difference in the idea of a thing, then the things themselves are exactly the same. This means if two things don’t differ in their ideas, they are completely identical. But when we think about ideas, we leave out many important parts of what we actually experience. So, it’s wrong to say those missing parts don’t exist at all, and that a thing is only what’s in its idea.

For example, the idea of a cubic foot of space is always the same in my mind. But two cubic feet are different because of where they are located in space. These differences come from what we actually see or feel, not just from the idea itself.
