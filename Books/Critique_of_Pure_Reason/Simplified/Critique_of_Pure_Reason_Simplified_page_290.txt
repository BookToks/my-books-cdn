In fact, even after abstraction from all sensible condition, significance, but only a logical significance of the mere unity of representations, is left to the pure concepts of the understanding, but no object and thus no significance is given to them that could yield a concepta of the object.b Thus, e.g., if one leaves out the sensible determination of persistence, substance would signify nothing more than a something that can be thought as a subject (without being a predicate of something else).
 
 Now out of this representation I can make nothing, as it shows me nothing at all about what determinations the thing that is to count as B 187 such a first subject is to have. Without schemata, therefore, the categories are only functions of the understanding for concepts, but do not represent any object. This significance comes to them from sensibility, which realizes the understanding at the same time as it restricts it.
