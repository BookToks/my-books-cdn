Even if you take away all the sensory details, pure concepts from understanding only have a logical meaning as a simple connection of ideas. They don’t point to any real object or give a clear meaning that helps you understand an actual thing.

For example, if you remove the idea of something lasting over time, the word "substance" would just mean something that can be thought of as a subject, but it wouldn’t tell you anything about what that subject actually is.

Because of this, I can’t figure out anything from this idea alone, since it doesn’t show me what qualities the thing should have. Without special ways to connect ideas to sensory experiences, these basic concepts are just mental tools and don’t represent any real object.

Their real meaning comes from our senses, which help our understanding but also limit it.
