No matter how this turns out (because we still have to figure it out), one thing is clear: understanding things from basic principles is very different from just knowing stuff in your mind. Knowing something in your mind can come before other knowledge as a rule, but it doesn’t really come from just thinking or include a universal rule.

If the understanding is like a tool that organizes what we see by using rules, then reason is the tool that organizes those rules themselves. Reason doesn’t work directly with what we experience or with objects. Instead, it works with the understanding to connect lots of ideas together before we even experience anything. This connection is called "the unity of reason," and it’s very different from the kind of organization the understanding does.

This is the general idea of what reason does, even though it might be hard to fully get without examples (which will come later).

Now, about how reason works logically.

We can tell the difference between things we know right away and things we only figure out by thinking. For example, knowing that a shape with three straight sides has three angles is something we see immediately. But knowing that those three angles add up to two right angles is something we have to figure out. Because we use these kinds of guesses or conclusions all the time, we often forget about this difference and sometimes we even believe something is obvious when it’s actually just something we figured out.

Every time we make a conclusion, there’s a starting statement (the reason), the conclusion itself, and the logical step that connects the two. If the conclusion is already included in the first statement and you don’t need anything else to get it, that’s called an "immediate inference" or an inference of understanding.

But if you need another statement or idea to get to the conclusion, then it’s a more complex kind of reasoning.
