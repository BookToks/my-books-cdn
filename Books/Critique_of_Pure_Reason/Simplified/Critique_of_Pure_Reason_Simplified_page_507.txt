They looked at changes in the world and figured out that things depend on causes we can see and experience. This gave them a chain of causes, one after another, which made sense. But since they couldn’t find a first cause or the top cause in this chain, they stopped thinking about causes based on experience and started using a pure idea instead. This idea said there has to be one absolutely necessary cause that doesn’t depend on anything else, and it doesn’t follow time like the rest. But doing this is wrong, as we can see below.

In a pure sense, something is called “contingent” if its opposite is possible. But you can’t get this idea of pure contingency just from things happening in the world. When something changes, its opposite state happens at a different time, so it’s possible. But that doesn’t mean the opposite could have happened at the same time. For example, if a body was moving (A) and then stops (not-A), the fact that rest comes after movement doesn’t mean rest could have been happening instead of movement at the same time.

We only know that rest happened after motion, so it was possible then. But motion and rest happening at different times are not true opposites that can exist at the same time. So just because things change doesn’t prove that something is truly “contingent” in the pure sense. It also doesn’t prove that there is a necessary being based on pure ideas. Change only shows that new states depend on causes from before, following the rule of cause and effect.

Even if we think the cause is absolutely necessary, it still has to belong to time and be part of the series of things we experience.
