In the transcendental aesthetic, we first focus on sensibility by removing everything the mind understands through concepts, so only what we sense directly remains.

Next, we take away everything related to feelings from that, leaving only pure intuition and the basic way things appear. This is what sensibility can give us before any experience. When we study this, we find two pure forms of how we sense things that are the basis for knowledge before experience: space and time. We will now look at these.

First, about space:

Our outer sense (a part of our mind) helps us imagine things outside of us, all placed in space. In space, their shape, size, and how they relate to each other can be figured out.

Our inner sense helps us understand ourselves or our inner feelings, but it doesn't show us the soul as a thing. Still, it gives a specific way to sense our inner state, so everything inside us is understood in terms of time. We can’t sense time outside like space, and we can’t sense space inside us.

So, what are space and time? Are they real things? Or are they just ways we understand things, even if things exist without us noticing them? Or are space and time only parts of how our mind works, meaning we can only describe things using space and time because of how our mind is made?

To figure this out, we will explain what space means first. By explanation, we mean clearly showing what belongs to the idea of space, especially in a way that shows we understand space before any experience.

Space is not a concept we get from seeing things outside ourselves.
