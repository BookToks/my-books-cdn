Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III talks about how we understand things based on what we can sense. I use a special idea, but only in a way that helps me connect all my experiences into one big picture. I think about a being that's different from the world we see, but I don’t need to know what this being really is because I don’t have the right ideas or words for that. Concepts like reality, substance, cause, or necessity don’t make sense when I think about something beyond what I can sense. I only think about how this unknown being might relate to making the whole world’s experience fit together as one idea. This helps me use my reason better when I think about the world.

If we look at this idea of a being beyond our senses, we see that we can’t assume it really exists in the way we understand things like reality or cause. These ideas don’t apply to something totally different from what we can sense. So when we think about a highest being or a supreme cause, we only do it to help make the world’s experiences fit together in a logical way. This being is just an idea, and we don’t really know what it is. That’s why, even though we need the idea of a necessary being to explain the world we experience, we can never really understand what that being is or why it must exist.

Now, we can clearly see the main point of the whole Transcendental Dialectic. The ideas of pure reason only become confusing when we misunderstand them. Pure reason is really only about itself. It can’t focus on objects outside of our understanding but only on connecting what we already know into one system. The unity of reason is about making a system, and this system doesn’t work as a rule for things outside us but as a guideline for how we connect all the things we experience.

Still, this way of connecting ideas doesn’t just help us think about more things; it also helps us understand how everything fits together better.
