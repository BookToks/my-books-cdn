Here’s a simpler version of the passage, broken into smaller paragraphs for easier reading:

Some ideas don’t just belong to one specific thing but to everything we can sense. There’s no problem with the idea of a thing if it only has positive qualities, because positive ideas don’t cancel each other out. But when we actually experience something real, like motion, there are conditions—like moving in opposite directions—that can cause conflicts. These conflicts aren’t about logic but about how things actually happen, and they can make something that seems positive turn into zero. So, just because ideas don’t conflict doesn’t mean reality always agrees with those ideas.

When we think about things only by their ideas, we imagine an inner part that is the base for all outside relations. If I ignore all outside conditions and just focus on the idea of a thing itself, I can ignore any outside connections and still have an idea that shows its inner qualities. It might seem like every thing has something inside it that comes before any outside connections, something simple that doesn’t have any outside relations. Since we know inner qualities only through our inner feelings, this inner base would not only be simple but also filled with mental images or thoughts. That means all things would be like “monads,” simple beings with thoughts inside them.

This idea would be right if the conditions that let us experience outer objects were only about the concept of a thing. But actually, those conditions show that what appears in space—things that take up space and can’t pass through each other—are just made of relations and don’t have anything absolutely inside them. Still, these things can be the main base for everything we perceive outside ourselves. When we use only ideas, we can’t think of something outside without thinking about inner qualities too.

If someone tries to say that at least things we can’t sense don’t fight each other, they would still need an example of such things to understand if they really mean something. But we only know examples from experience, which shows us only what we can sense. So, saying that ideas with only positive parts don’t have negatives is just repeating something we already know and never doubted.
