Reason is another ability we have that helps us connect ideas based on what we understand. It works well when we use it to link thoughts together logically. But it doesn’t work properly if we think it can help us know things like God just by thinking, without any real experiences or senses.

The only true way reason is useful is when it helps us come up with ideas about things we can’t see or experience, based on what’s right and wrong. So, reason is really helpful when we use it to guide how we should act. It can’t prove perfect things just by thinking, but it can help us believe in ideas about being morally perfect, which Kant calls "postulates of practical reason."

Some parts of this book introduce big ideas that will be changed later. But other parts talk about how we experience space and time, and those ideas stay mostly the same. Kant says that our mind has a fixed rule: everything we sense belongs together in one big picture.

He explains there are two important rules: time, which applies to everything we sense inside and outside ourselves, and space, which is how we see things outside of us.

Kant says space and time are the basic ways we understand everything we sense. They are not things we learn from experience but the forms that let us experience things. They help us understand math and science.

However, this only applies to things we can sense. We can’t say space and time describe things we can’t sense.

Kant makes two points about time: (1) Our idea of time doesn’t come from experience, but we already need to understand time to have any experience at all. (2) Time is one continuous thing, not just random moments; every moment fits into one bigger timeline.
