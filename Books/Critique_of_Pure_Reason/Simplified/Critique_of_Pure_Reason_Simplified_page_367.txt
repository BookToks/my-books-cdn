This land is an island, surrounded by natural borders that can’t be changed. It’s called the land of truth, which is a nice name. Around it is a wide, stormy ocean full of illusions, where fog banks and melting icebergs trick travelers into thinking they’ve found new lands. These tricks keep travelers caught in endless adventures they can’t escape or finish.

Before we go out into this ocean to explore and see if there’s anything real to find, it’s a good idea to look again at the island we’re leaving. We should ask if we can be happy with what the island has, or if we must accept it because we have no better place to build on. We also need to know why we own this land and how we can keep it safe from others who might want it. 

Even though we’ve already answered these questions before, a quick review will help us understand better by bringing all the answers together in one place.

We have seen that everything our mind understands doesn’t come from itself but is used only to help us experience things.
