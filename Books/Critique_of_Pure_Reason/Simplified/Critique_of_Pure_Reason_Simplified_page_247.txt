There is only one experience, where all the things we notice are connected in a clear and natural way, just like there is only one space and time where everything happens. When people talk about different experiences, they are actually just parts of the same overall experience. The way these experiences are joined together is what makes experience possible, and this happens because our mind links everything based on ideas.

If the way our mind connects what we see and feel was random, then our mind would just be filled with random images without making any real sense. We wouldn't be able to understand or think about what we experience. Without this connection, our perceptions would be just pictures without meaning, so they wouldn’t really count as knowledge.

The rules that let us have any experience at all also make it possible for the things we experience to exist. The categories we talked about are just the rules our mind uses to think about possible experiences, just like space and time are rules for how we see things. These categories are basic ideas that help us think about objects and experiences, and they are true before we even have any experience.

The reason these categories are necessary is because our senses and all possible things we experience depend on our mind’s original way of understanding. Everything has to fit together according to these basic rules for us to have real experience.
