Part II, Division I, Book 1, Chapter 1 talks about the system’s principles but doesn’t try to make the system complete. I’ll save that for another time. But you could easily do it by using ontological textbooks. For example, under the idea of causality, you could include force, action, and passion. Under community, you could put presence and resistance. Under modality, you could add generation, corruption, alteration, and more.

When you mix these categories with how we sense things or with each other, you get lots of basic ideas that come before experience. Making a full list of these ideas would be helpful and even fun, but I don’t need to do that here.

I am not giving exact definitions of these categories in this work, even though I wish I had them. In the next work, I will explain these ideas enough to help with the method I am developing. In a system based only on pure reason, people might expect me to do this now. But here, it would only distract us by causing questions and doubts that can wait for later without hurting our main goal.

From what I have shown so far, it’s clear that making a complete dictionary with all the needed definitions should be possible and even easy. The main headings already exist; we just need to fill them in. A system like this helps make sure every idea has its place and helps us notice any missing parts.

You could think deeply about this table of categories, which might affect how all scientific knowledge is structured. This table is very useful and even necessary in philosophy for making a full plan of science based on basic ideas that come before experience. It also helps divide knowledge clearly according to certain rules. This is obvious because the table includes all the basic concepts.
