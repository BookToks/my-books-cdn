Kant says that rules are needed for our mind to work as one whole. This means we recognize that all the things we think about come from the same mind, even if they are about different things.

Kant doesn’t clearly explain two ways of thinking about this, or how to connect them. This confusion causes problems in all his efforts to explain how we understand categories. It shows up in the first version of his work called the "Deduction." Because of this, Kant kept trying to find the right way to explain it. He rewrote the "Deduction" in the second edition of his book, and also worked on it in other writings between 1783 and the 1790s. Scholars have found it really hard to figure out what Kant meant by this part, mostly because Kant himself wasn’t sure.

Even though Kant didn’t fix this main problem, by 1778-79 he had figured out a lot about the rest of his book. Drafts from that time show he had planned the final version of two big parts called the "Transcendental Analytic" and the "Transcendental Dialectic." The "Dialectic" was more complicated than before. Instead of just one group of problems, Kant split it into three parts about different kinds of mistakes our thinking makes.

Kant planned his book to have two main sections. The first one has two parts: the first part talks about space and time, which he called the "Transcendental Aesthetic." The second part, called the "Transcendental Analytic," explains how we can know things about the world before we experience them. Here, Kant tries to show how categories help us understand time and experience by using a kind of connecting idea called a schematism.
