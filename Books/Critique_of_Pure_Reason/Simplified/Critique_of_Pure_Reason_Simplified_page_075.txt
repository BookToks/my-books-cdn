Alternatively, Kant suggests that rules are necessary for the unity of consciousness as a form of self-consciousness, the recognition that various representations, whatever objects they may or may not represent, all have the unity of belonging to a single mind.
 
 Kant does not clearly separate these two strategies, nor suggest a means for connecting them. This ambiguity will plague all of Kant's attempts to find a definitive form for the deduction of the categories. It runs throughout the first-edition version of the "Deduction," and then leads Kant to continue to experiment with the proper form for the deduction, not merely in the second edition of the Critique, in which he completely rewrites the "Deduction," but in the intervening period, in which he tries to resolve the ambiguity in the Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783), I48 the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786), '49 and a number of surviving drafts, 5° and on into the 1790S as I well, where he continued to tinker with the deduction in his drafts for an essay on the Real Progress of Metaphysics from the Time of Leibniz and Woljf.'S' Arriving at a definitive interpretation of the transcendental de­ duction of the categories has been the most difficult task for Kant schol­ arship throughout the twentieth century, and this underlying ambivalence in Kant's conception of its strategy is a large part of the reason for this problem. '52 Kant never resolved the issue of the fundamental strategy of the de­ duction of the categories, but much else about the content and struc­ ture of the Critique had clearly been resolved by 1778-79. Several extensive drafts from this period show that Kant had not only arrived at the final organization of the "Transcendental Analytic," but also that he had now arrived at the final organization of the "Transcendental Dialectic," which is also more complicated than the schemes he had been considering in the period 1775-77. \Vhereas in the notes from that period Kant presented the material of the "Dialectic" as a single set of antinomies, now he has divided the material into three main parts, the diagnosis of "three kinds of transcendental illusion" generated by "three kinds of rational inference."'53 Thus, at this point Kant envi­ sioned the following argument.
 
 The constructive argument of the book would consist of two main parts. The first of these would in turn be broken into two further parts: first would be the account of space and time that had been in place since 770; in the Critique Kant would finally entitle this the "Transcendental I Aesthetic." Then in the second, under the title of "Transcendental Analytic" that he now introduces, I54 Kant would make the argument, based on the principle that "We can have synthetic cognition a priori about objects of experience, if [it] consists of principles of the possibil62 Introduction ity of experience"'55 that he now explicitly formulates, in which a tran­ scendental deduction of the categories would be linked to a demonstra­ tion of their role in empirical time-determination by means of an intervening schematism of those categories.
