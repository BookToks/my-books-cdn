Proof: Let’s imagine the world had a beginning. That means there was a time before the world existed—an empty time with nothing in it. But nothing can start during an empty time because there’s no part of that time that comes before another part to cause anything to happen. So, many things can begin in the world, but the world itself can’t have a starting point. That means the world has always existed forever.

Now, about the second point: imagine the world is limited in size and has edges. That would mean there’s empty space outside the world, which has no limits. So, there would be a relationship not just between things inside space, but also between the world and this empty space.

But the world is everything there is—there’s nothing outside it. So, the world can’t really have a relationship with empty space because empty space doesn’t exist as a real thing. Because of this, the idea that the world has edges or limits is false. This means the world doesn’t have boundaries in space and must be infinite in size.

Space isn’t an actual thing you can see or touch; it’s just the way we understand where things are. Before anything fills or limits space, it’s just an empty idea, not a real object.
