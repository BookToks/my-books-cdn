Part of how I understand the size of the world comes from looking at things step by step, going from one thing to the next in a chain of causes or conditions. But I never really know for sure how far this chain goes. I just know that from any one thing, I have to look for something else that caused it, and then something else that caused that, and so on.

Because of this, I can’t say the size of everything we see is a fixed or final number. I also can’t say this chain goes on forever, because that would mean I’m already thinking about things I haven’t seen or reached yet. That would be like guessing how many things there are without actually knowing them, which isn’t possible.

The whole world, as I experience it, doesn’t come to me all at once through my senses, so I don’t have a set idea of how big it is before I start looking for causes step by step. So, I can’t say anything definite about the size of the world itself, not even if this chain of causes goes on forever.

What I do know is how to keep looking for causes: whenever I find one thing, I should try to find what caused it, and keep doing that without stopping. This is called an indefinite regress, which means I keep going further and further without ever finding a final cause or limit. This is different from saying the chain is infinite in a strict sense because I’m not saying the world’s size is fixed or measurable in this way.

Because of this, I can’t say the world is infinite in time or space. The idea of the world having a size that goes on forever doesn’t fit with what I can experience. But I also can’t say the world is limited or has an edge, because that also can’t be proven by what I observe.

So, I can’t say much about the whole world as an object of experience. I can only talk about the rule that tells me how to keep exploring and understanding the world step by step.

So, when asked about whether the world has a beginning or an edge, the answer is: The world doesn’t have a first moment in time, and it doesn’t have an outer boundary in space.

If it did, there would be empty time before the beginning or empty space beyond the edge, but since what we see is always part of this ongoing chain, that can’t be true.
