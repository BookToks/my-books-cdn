Even people who don’t agree with Kant’s answers to how natural science is based and how we understand our moral choices still have to deal with these problems. They need to find their own way to avoid what they don’t like about Kant’s ideas. Because of this, all modern thinkers are influenced by Kant, whether they like it or not.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE CRITIQUE

The Critique of Pure Reason is often seen as the result of a big change in Kant’s thinking around 1772. It’s like a midlife crisis when the 48-year-old Kant stopped following the old philosophy made by Christian Wolff, who built it from ideas of the philosopher Leibniz. This old philosophy was very popular in German universities after the 1720s. Kant himself helped create this story by saying that remembering the ideas of David Hume woke him up from his “dogmatic slumber” and changed the way he worked on philosophy.  

There were definitely big changes in Kant’s ideas before and after he wrote his dissertation in 1770, which came just before many years of hard work that led to the Critique published in 1781. But Kant gave the wrong idea that all his earlier work was just sleeping in Wolff’s old way and that he only woke up because of Hume’s skepticism.

Actually, Kant had been questioning important parts of the old philosophy since his first big philosophical work in 1755. There were important changes in Kant’s ideas around 1769-70 before his dissertation, and then even more changes in his thoughts and how he did philosophy starting in 1772, leading up to the Critique.
