The opposite idea of pure reason is that even if we accept there is a special kind of freedom that can start changes in the world, this freedom must be outside the world. This is a big assumption because it means something exists outside everything we can possibly experience or see.

However, we can’t say that this freedom exists inside things in the world. If we did, then everything we see around us, which follows natural laws, wouldn’t work the way it does. These natural laws help us tell the difference between real experiences and dreams.

If there was a freedom that didn’t follow any rules, nature wouldn’t make sense anymore. The natural laws would keep changing because of this freedom, making everything look random and confusing instead of regular and predictable.

The idea is that there must be something in the world, or causing the world, that is absolutely necessary and can’t not exist.
