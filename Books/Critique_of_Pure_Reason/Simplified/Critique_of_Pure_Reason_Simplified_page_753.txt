Back in the 1600s and 1700s, a thinker named Nicolas Malebranche had an idea called occasionalism. It says that bodies and minds can’t directly affect each other. Instead, God is the one who makes things happen between them. But some other philosophers, like Wolff and Baumgarten, didn’t agree with this idea.

The "Pillars of Hercules" was an old name for two big rocks at the entrance of the Strait of Gibraltar. One is called Gibraltar in the north, and the other is Jebel Musa in the south. This spot is where the Atlantic Ocean starts.

There were some notes and thoughts about changing parts of a book called the "Paralogisms" in the late 1700s. These changes were discussed in some letters and writings from that time.

Moses Mendelssohn wrote a book about the soul and whether it lives forever. In it, he shares a conversation where Socrates talks about what it means if the soul dies. Socrates says the soul could either disappear all at once or slowly change into something else, like dust or air. Then Cebes says those are the only two options.

Socrates then asks if the soul could really just vanish suddenly by nature. He thinks not, because nature can’t just destroy something completely in an instant. Nature works slowly, like how things change bit by bit.

He explains that there isn’t a clear moment when a living body just dies suddenly. Instead, the body breaks down gradually, with parts stopping their work little by little until the whole thing falls apart.

So, if the soul dies with the body, it would also have to fade away slowly, losing its powers bit by bit, just like how the body’s parts stop working together.

In the end, Socrates says we need to look into whether the soul’s inner powers can slowly disappear, just like parts of a machine come apart over time.
