When you add a new part to a statement, it becomes a synthetic judgment.

All judgments based on experience are synthetic. It wouldn’t make sense to base an analytic judgment on experience because analytic judgments only use what’s already in the concept. You don’t need to check with experience to make them. For example, "a body takes up space" is something we know without experience. Before seeing anything, the idea already has everything needed to understand it, and we realize it must be true just by thinking about it. Experience can’t teach us this.

On the other hand, the idea of a body doesn’t include weight by itself, but since a body is something we can experience, we can add weight to the idea based on what we observe. First, we understand the concept of a body by its features like size, shape, and being solid. But then, by looking back at our experience, we notice that weight is always connected to these features. So, we add weight to the concept as a new part. This is possible because both ideas come from experience, even though one isn’t inside the other. They belong together only because they are parts of the bigger picture—our experience, which combines different observations.

But for synthetic judgments that are known without experience (called synthetic a priori), we don’t have this experience to help us. If we want to add something new to a concept without checking the world, what do we rely on? For example, when we say, "Everything that happens has a cause," we think about something that happens, something that exists after a certain time, and so on.
