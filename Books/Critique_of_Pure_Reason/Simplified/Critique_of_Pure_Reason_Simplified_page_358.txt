Because of this, pure ideas from understanding don’t have real meaning on their own.

This means these pure ideas can only be used with experience, not on their own. The rules of pure understanding only apply to things we can sense, based on how we can possibly experience them. They don’t apply to things in general without considering how we might perceive them.

So, understanding can only predict the form of possible experiences beforehand. Since things that aren’t appearances can’t be experienced, understanding can’t go beyond what we can sense. Its rules only explain appearances, and the big idea of knowing things for sure without experience (like cause and effect) has to be replaced by a simpler idea—just analyzing how understanding works.

Thinking means connecting what we sense to an object. If we don’t know how we sense something, then the object is just a general idea, not a real thing. Pure ideas ignore how we sense things, so they don’t define any specific object, just the idea of any object in general.

To use an idea, we also need a way to judge or recognize an object under that idea. If this way (called a schema) is missing, then we can’t connect anything to the idea. Without this, the pure idea only has a general, abstract use.
