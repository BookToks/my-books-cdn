Acknowledgments

This translation of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason is the result of many years of work by both of us. During this time, many students, friends, and colleagues helped us a lot.

We want to especially thank those who gave us a lot of their time and effort. People who helped us with the preparation and revision of the translation include Gunter Zoller, Charles Parsons, Stephan Wagner, the students in Paul Guyer's Kant classes at the University of Pennsylvania in 1994-95, and the students in Allen Wood's "German Philosophical Texts" classes at Cornell University in 1990 and 1992.

Jens Timmerman shared detailed corrections of the Raymund Schmidt (Meiner) edition of the German text, and Georg Mohr gave us corrections of the Ingeborg Heidemann (Reclam) edition. Several people, like Lewis White Beck, Rolf George, and Martin Weatherston, offered corrections of earlier English translations.

John Cooper and Rega Wood helped us find and identify classical quotes. The trustees of the Florence R. C. Murray Trust provided the research fund that paid for copies of the original editions of the Critique and other research materials.

Finally, a big thanks to Allison Crapo and Cynthia Schossberger for their careful and generous help with proofreading.
