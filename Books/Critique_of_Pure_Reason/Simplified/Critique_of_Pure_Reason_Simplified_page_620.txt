Critique of all speculative theology thing that might ever belong to the context of possible experience as if this experience constituted an absolute unity, but one dependent through and through, and always still conditioned within the world of sense, yet at the same time as if the sum total of all appearances (the world of sense itself) had a single supreme and all-sufficient ground outside its range, namely an independent, original, and creative reason, as it were, in relation to which we direct every empirical use of our rea- A673 / B 701 son in its greatest extension as if the objects themselves had arisen from that original image of all reason. That means: it is not from a simple thinking substance that we derive the inner appearances of our soul, but from one another in accordance with the idea of a simple being; it is not from a highest intelligence that we derive the order of the world and its systematic unity, but rather it is from the idea of a most wise cause that we take the rule that reason is best off using for its own satisfaction when it connects up causes and effects in the world.
 
 Now there is not the least thing to hinder us from assuming these ideas as objective and hypostatic, except only the cosmological ones, where reason runs up against an antinomy when it tries to bring this about (the psychological and theological ideas contain nothing of that sort at all). For there is no contradiction in them, so how could anyone dispute their objective reality, since he knows just as little about their possibility in denying it as we do in affirming it? Nevertheless, in order to assume something it is not enough that there is no positive hindrance to doing so, and we cannot be allowed to introduce mere thoughtÂ­ entities a that transcend all our concepts, though they contradict none of them, as real and determinate objects merely on credit, just so that speculative reason can complete its business as it likes. Thus they A674/B 702 should not be assumed in themselves, but their reality should hold only as that of a schema of the regulative principleb for the systematic unity of all cognitions of nature; hence they should be grounded only as analogues of real things, but not as things in themselves. We remove from the object of an idea those conditions that limit our concept of the understanding, but that also make it possible for us to be able to have a determinate concept of any thing. And now we are thinking of a Something about which we have no concept at all of how it is in itself, but about which we think a relation to the sum total of appearances, which is analogous to the relation that appearances have to one another.
 
 If, accordingly, we assume such ideal entities, then we do not really extend our cognition beyond the objects of possible experience, but c Gedankenwesen a Princip b , Objecte 607 Doctrine of Elements.
