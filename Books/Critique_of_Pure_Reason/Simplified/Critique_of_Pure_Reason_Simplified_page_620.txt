Criticism of all ideas about God or ultimate things tries to fit them into what we can possibly experience, as if all our experiences are connected and depend on the world we see and feel. But at the same time, it treats all the things we experience as if they come from one ultimate source outside our world—a creative and independent reason. We think about this reason as if everything we experience comes from it.

This means we don’t get the feelings inside our minds from some simple, pure thinking thing, but from each other, based on the idea of a simple being. We don’t get the order of the world from a highest intelligence but from the idea of a very wise cause. This wise cause helps reason find the best way to connect causes and effects in the world.

There’s nothing stopping us from believing these ideas are real, except for the ones about the universe as a whole, where reason runs into problems. But ideas about the mind or God don’t have these problems. Since no one can prove these ideas are impossible, no one can prove they’re real either. Just because we can’t prove something is impossible doesn’t mean we should believe in it as a real thing. We shouldn’t just accept ideas that go beyond what we can understand as real, only because it helps our thinking.

So, these ideas should not be taken as real things by themselves. Instead, their reality should be seen as a guiding rule for how we organize all our knowledge about nature. They should be like models or examples of real things, but not real things themselves. We take away the parts that limit our understanding but also help us clearly think about things. Now, we think about something we don’t understand fully, but we imagine it relates to everything we experience, just like how the things we experience relate to each other.

If we accept these ideal ideas, then we aren’t really going beyond what we can experience. Instead, we are using ideas to help us understand what we do experience.
