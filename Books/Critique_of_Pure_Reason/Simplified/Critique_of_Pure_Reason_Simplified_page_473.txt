Sometimes, human thinking runs into problems it can’t solve, especially when it tries to understand the universe.

This happens naturally, without anyone forcing it, and it protects our mind from believing in something one-sided or false. But it also makes us either give up and stop trying to understand, or become stubborn and refuse to listen to other ideas. Both of these choices are bad for healthy thinking.

Before we get into the confusing arguments caused by these problems in pure thinking, we need to explain how we will handle the topic. I call all big ideas about the world “world-concepts” because they are about the whole world, even though they are just ideas based on what we see. These ideas are about combining what we experience, while pure reason aims at understanding everything in general, which is different from just thinking about the world we see.

Just like one kind of wrong thinking led to a theory about the mind, these problems in pure thinking show us ideas about the universe that seem convincing but actually don’t match what we experience.

To list these ideas clearly, we first need to understand that only our understanding can create pure and deep concepts. Reason by itself can’t make new concepts but can help free our understanding from its limits.
