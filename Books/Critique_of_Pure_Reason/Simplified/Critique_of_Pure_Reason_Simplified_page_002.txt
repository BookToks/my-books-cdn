This new translation of the Critique of Pure Reason is the most accurate and detailed English version ever made of this important philosophical book. It uses simple and clear language, so new readers can understand Kant easily, but it also has deep and careful work that will help experts learn more.

By comparing the best modern German versions with the original 1781 and 1787 texts, and paying close attention to Kant’s special words and sentence style, this translation tries to keep all the original meanings and details. It also includes all the handwritten changes and notes Kant made in his own copy of the first edition, something no German version has done before. This means readers get a version very close to what Kant himself read.

The Cambridge Edition gives readers the chance to see different versions of parts that Kant changed a lot for the second edition, like the prefaces, introduction, and some important chapters. These versions are kept separate but linked carefully so readers can compare them easily.

The book also has helpful notes, clear glossaries, a detailed index, and a big introduction written by two top Kant experts. This introduction explains the book’s main ideas and how it was written over time.
