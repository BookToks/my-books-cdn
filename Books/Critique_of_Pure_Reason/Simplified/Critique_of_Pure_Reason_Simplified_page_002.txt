This entirely new translation of the Critique of Pure Reason is the most accurate and informative English translation ever produced of this epochal philosophical text. Though its simple and direct style will make it suitable for all new readers of Kant, the translation displays an un­ precedented philosophical and textual sophistication that will enlighten Kant scholars as well.
 
 Through the comparison of the best modern German editions to the original 178 and 1787 versions of the text, and careful attention to the I precise translation of Kant's terminology, as well as the faithful render­ ing of the structure and syntax of Kant's prose, this translation recreates as far as possible a text with the same interpretative nuances and rich­ ness as the original. Moreover, by including the complete text of the handwritten emendations and marginal notes made by Kant in his own personal copy of the first edition, this volume does what even no German edition has ever done: furnish the reader with a text as close as possible to the one present in Kant's own library.
 
 The Cambridge Edition places the reader in the most independent yet best informed interpretative position by presenting entirely sepa­ rate (though meticulously cross-referenced) versions of all the portions of the work that Kant revised heavily for the second edition: the pref­ aces, the introduction, Transcendental Aesthetic, Transcendental De­ duction, the chapter on Phenomena and Noumena, and the Paralo­ gisms of Pure Reason.
 
 The extensive editorial apparatus includes informative annotation, detailed glossaries, a thorough but perspicuous index, and a large-scale general introduction in which two of the world's preeminent Kant schol­ ars provide a succinct summary of the structure and argument of the Critique as well as a detailed account of its long and complex genesis.
