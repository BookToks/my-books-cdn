We will call this clear and pure way of sensing things, which is limited by how we understand ideas, the "schema" of that idea. The way our understanding works with these schemata is called the "schematism" of pure understanding.

A schema is always something created by our imagination. But unlike an image that shows a specific thing, a schema is more about bringing together our senses in a general way. For example, if I put five dots in a line, . . . . ., that’s an image of the number five. But if I just think about the idea of a number, like five or a hundred, that is more like a method for imagining any number, not just one specific picture. This kind of general way of imagining to match an idea is what we call a schema.

Actually, it’s not pictures of things but schemata that help us understand pure ideas we sense. No picture of a triangle can fully show what a triangle means because the idea covers all kinds of triangles—big, small, right-angled, or sharp. A triangle schema only exists in our mind and shows a rule for imagining shapes in space. Even real things or pictures don’t fully match the idea we have; instead, the idea connects directly to the schema in our imagination, which guides how we picture things. For example, the idea of a dog is a rule that helps me imagine any four-legged animal, not just one dog I’ve seen or a photo I have. This schematism, the way our understanding works with how things appear and their shape, is a secret skill inside us that’s hard to fully understand.

All we can say is this: an image comes from our imagination based on experience, while a schema is a rule for how we imagine ideas.
