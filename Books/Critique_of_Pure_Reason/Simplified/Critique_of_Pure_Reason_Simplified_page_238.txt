The main idea of the transcendental deduction is this: all the basic ideas we have must be understood as necessary conditions for having any experience at all, whether it’s what we see or how we think. These ideas are important because they make experience possible. But just showing these ideas in experience doesn’t prove where they come from—it only shows them in action. Without their connection to possible experience, we wouldn’t understand how they relate to anything we know.

There are three basic parts of our mind that make experience possible, and they can’t be explained by anything else. These are sense, imagination, and apperception (which means self-awareness). First, our senses bring in different pieces of information. Then, our imagination puts these pieces together. Finally, apperception unites everything into one experience. Besides their everyday use, these parts also work in a special way that deals only with the form of experience, and this is something we can understand before any actual experience happens. We already talked about senses before, so now we’ll try to understand imagination and apperception better.

The philosopher Locke didn’t think about this properly. Because he saw pure ideas in experience, he thought these ideas came from experience itself. This was a mistake because it led him to try to know things beyond what experience can really tell us. David Hume realized that these ideas must come before experience. But since he couldn’t explain how the mind could think of ideas that aren’t just copied from experience, and he didn’t think the mind might actually create the experience using these ideas, he ended up saying these ideas come from experience after all. He believed that because things happen together often, we just get used to thinking they are connected. But this is just a habit, not a real, objective connection.
