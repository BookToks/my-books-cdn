How can we apply big ideas like “causality” to the things we actually see and experience, when no one thinks we can directly sense these ideas? This question is really important and is the reason we need a special explanation about how our mind connects pure ideas to what we observe. In most sciences, the ideas we use to understand things aren’t very different from what we actually see, so they don’t need this kind of explanation.

It’s clear that there must be something in the middle that links these big ideas and the things we experience. This middle thing has to be pure (not based on experience) but also connected to both our thinking and our senses.

This middle thing is called the “transcendental schema.”

When we think about understanding, we use pure ideas that bring together many different parts into one whole. Time, which is how we feel and connect everything inside us, gives us a way to organize these parts before we even experience anything. A special kind of time, which is connected to these pure ideas, matches both the big ideas and what we see because it is universal and follows rules we know without experience. Since time is part of every experience, this “time-scheme” helps us apply these big ideas to what we actually observe.

After explaining all this, no one should be confused about whether these pure ideas only work with what we experience or if they apply to things beyond what we can sense. We have seen that ideas don’t mean anything without objects given to us, so they can’t apply to things we can’t experience. Also, the way we experience things is the only way objects are presented to us. Finally, these pure ideas must include rules about how we sense things inside ourselves, and these rules are what let us apply big ideas to any object we experience.
