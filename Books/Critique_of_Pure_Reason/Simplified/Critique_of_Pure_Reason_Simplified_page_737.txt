Kant refers to "Lucians Schriften. Erster Theil. Zurich bey Gefiner. 1769" in his work around 1778 to 1781, especially on page 225.

You can also check other references from 1769 to the 1780s, like R 2129, R 2131-3, R 2147, R 2155, R 2162, and R 2177. There’s also the Jasche Logic introduction and Lectures on Logic for more info.

For earlier ideas about this topic, look at R 3920-1 from 1769.

An earlier outline can be found in R 3063 from 1776-78.

For more details on this part, see R 3063, R 3065-6, and R 3069 from the late 1770s and early 1780s.

Also, check R 3104-6 from 1776-78.

Compare R 4288 and R 5228 from 1770-78 for related points.

Look at R 4679 from 1776-78 where Kant says, "All appearances belong under titles of understanding."

For connected ideas, check R 4285 and R 4520 from the early 1770s.

The history of how Kant’s list of categories developed is long and complicated. Only some key documents are mentioned here.

The main change was how Kant slowly connected the three categories of relation, which he focused on a lot between 1774-75, with a four-part system based on logical functions of judgment.

A good example of the four-part system is R 3941 from 1769, and an early example of focusing on relations is R 4493 from 1772-76.

One of the first clear statements combining these two ideas is R 4656 from 1772-76; also see R 5055 from 1776-78.

Other early notes include R 4276 from 1770-71 and R 4215 from 1775-78.

For a late summary of these ideas, see R 6338a from 1794-95.

Many notes focus mainly on categories of relation, like R 4385 (1771), R 4496 (1772-76), R 5284 and 5286 (1776-78), R 5289-90 (1776-78), and R 5854 (1783-84).

However, in R 4276 (1770-71), Kant defines categories as "the general actions of reason."

Kant’s first thoughts on the problem of proving the categories came in a famous letter to Marcus Herz from February 21, 1772. For similar ideas, see R 4473 (1772) and R 4633-4 (1773-76).

Other passages using the same distinction appear in R 5636 (1780-81) and Metaphysik Mrongovius.

Kant calls Locke a "physiologist of reason" in several places, including R 4866 and R 4893 from 1776-78.
