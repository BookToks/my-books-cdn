The passages before this section can be found in R 505I (1776-78), R 5552 (1778-81), which is like a draft for this part, listing pairs of ideas talked about later at A263-6/ B 319-22, and also the ideas about something and nothing (A290-2/ B346-9). Another related passage is R 5554 (1778-81). Also, see R 5907 (1785-88? or 1776-79?). For more about criticizing Leibniz, see Real Progress, 20:281-5.

Leibniz showed his idea called the identity of indiscernibles, which means two things can’t be different just because they are in different places or times—they must also be different inside. Kant is arguing against this. Leibniz gave the example of two drops of water or milk in his Fourth Letter to Samuel Clarke, written in 1717, a year after Leibniz died.

We can see Leibniz’s view in an essay called "Primary Truths," where he says the identity of indiscernibles comes from the idea that all truths come from analyzing concepts. This essay was published in 1905, so Kant didn’t know about it. Kant probably got his ideas about Leibniz from other writings, like Monadology, section 9, where Leibniz says all differences in nature come from internal features. Leibniz’s Fifth Paper in the Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence (sections 21-5) doesn’t clearly show where this idea came from, but later sections (26-9) connect it to his belief that space and time aren’t the basic things that define truth—only concepts are.

Kant uses an example with numbers here, which is another reference to his argument about Negative Magnitudes. Instead of using logic and contradiction, he uses math, like subtraction, to explain how things can be opposite in the real world, like forces or feelings. See 2:172-4; Theoretical Philosophy, 1755-1770, pp. 212-14.

Kant had access to sources like A New System of Nature, Principles of Nature and Grace, section 2, and Monadology, sections 3-11.

See Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, Leibniz’s Fifth Paper, section 47.

Aristotle’s Topics starts by saying we should find a way to ask questions that lets us argue based on good opinions and avoid saying things that go against those opinions (100a20-3; translation by 733 Notes to pages 372-374 W).
