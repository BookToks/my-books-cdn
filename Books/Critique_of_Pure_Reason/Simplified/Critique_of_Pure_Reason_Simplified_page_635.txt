Part 2, Division 2, Book 2, Chapter 3 explains ideas that bring more unity than just what we learn from experience. But because the goal we want to reach is so far away, these ideas try to make everything fit together as well as possible. If someone misunderstands and thinks these ideas are absolute truths about things beyond experience, they end up with a confusing and false understanding, causing endless arguments.

All human knowledge starts with what we see or feel, then moves to ideas, and finally to big concepts. Even though these three parts seem to come from knowledge beyond experience, careful thinking shows that reason can never go beyond what we can possibly experience. The main job of reason is to use all its tools to understand nature deeply, following rules that keep everything united, especially the idea that everything has a purpose. But it should never try to go beyond nature, because beyond that is just empty space for us.

The detailed study in the Transcendental Analytic shows that any claim to know things beyond experience can only lead to possible experiences. If we didn’t doubt even the clearest and most general ideas, and if we weren’t tempted by attractive but wrong ideas, we wouldn’t need to carefully check the confusing arguments that reason makes when it tries to claim too much. We already know that these claims, even if honestly meant, are completely wrong because they talk about knowledge no one can ever have.

Still, arguments will never end unless we understand the illusions that can trick even the smartest people. Also, we need to break down all our knowledge into its basic ideas to see clearly what’s really possible.
