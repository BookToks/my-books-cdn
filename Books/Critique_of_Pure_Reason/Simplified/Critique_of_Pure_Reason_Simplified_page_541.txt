The world is only understood by going backward step by step, not by seeing it all at once in some big picture. But going backward just measures how big something is, and it doesn’t give a clear idea of something that is infinitely big. So, it doesn’t actually reach infinity, it just goes on without a clear end, creating a size that becomes real through this process.

If I split something whole that I can see or imagine, I start moving from something that depends on other things to the things it depends on. Breaking it into parts is like going backward through these causes. You would only get the complete list of parts if you could finally reach simple, basic pieces. But if every part can still be split into smaller parts, this breaking down goes on forever.

These parts are all inside the whole thing I started with, and since the whole thing is shown clearly within its limits, all the parts are included too. So, this backward breaking down isn’t just endless in a random way, like some old ideas said, where you go from the whole to parts outside it, which you add later by looking around. But you still can’t say that a thing that can be split forever is made of infinitely many parts.

Even though all the parts are in the whole, the whole dividing process is not. The division is just the ongoing breaking down, which makes the series of parts real. Since this process never ends, all the parts found so far are in the whole together, but the entire infinite series of parts is not in the whole at once because it never finishes. So, you can’t show an infinite number of parts all together as one complete thing.

This idea is easy to see with space. Any space you can imagine inside its limits is a whole that can always be split into smaller spaces, so it can be divided forever.
