There is a kind of connection between different groups, like branches that all come from the same tree trunk.

This idea, called the law of the continuum of species (or logical forms), depends on another rule called the transcendental law of continuity in nature. Without this deeper rule, trying to understand nature just by the first idea could lead us the wrong way, because it might go against how nature really works. This rule has to be based on pure thinking, not on experience. If it were based on experience, it would come after we already knew about systems, but actually, this rule is what makes understanding nature in a system possible in the first place.

These laws don’t come from any secret plan to just try things out as experiments. Even though the connections they show give us good reasons to believe in a certain kind of unity, that’s not their main purpose. Instead, these laws help us judge how simple the causes are, how many effects there are, and how closely related things in nature really are. These ideas make sense by themselves and match how nature works, so they are useful on their own, not just as tools for scientists.

But it’s clear that this idea of continuous forms is just a thought, and we can’t find a real example of it in nature. That’s because species in nature are separate and divided, so they are like separate pieces. If the connection between species was truly continuous, there would have to be an infinite number of in-between species between any two species, which is impossible. Also, this law doesn’t help us in a clear way because it doesn’t show exactly what kind of connection there is or how far we should look for differences. It only tells us in a general way that we should look for connections.

If we arrange these ideas in the order we use them in real life, the principle of systematic unity would look something like this: a variety of related forms connected in a continuous way.
