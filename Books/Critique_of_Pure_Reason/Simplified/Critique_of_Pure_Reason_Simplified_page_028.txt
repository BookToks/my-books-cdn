Reason, which used to be seen as the most important part of how we think, works in two ways. First, it can make logical conclusions based on certain rules. Second, it tries to explain everyday ideas, like cause and effect, by linking them to big, basic ideas, such as the idea of a first cause that wasn’t caused by anything else.

These big ideas come from reason itself when it looks for something that doesn’t depend on anything else. It does this by using special thinking rules about how we understand the world. Specifically, there are three main ideas that come from how we relate things: the idea of substance, which leads to the idea of the soul as the main self; the idea of cause and effect, which leads to the idea of the whole world as a complete chain of causes; and the idea of community, which leads to the idea of God as the base for all possibilities. Kant says each of these ideas comes from a type of logical thinking that can only stop when it reaches an ultimate, unchanging foundation. Trying to understand things using these ideas, but without considering what we can actually sense, leads us to think about unchanging subjects, endless series, and all possible things.

The second, much longer part of the "Dialectic" explains "The Dialectical Inferences of Pure Reason" in detail. It looks at mistakes made in three areas: rational psychology (the study of the soul), rational cosmology (the study of the universe), and rational theology (the study of God).

The mistakes in rational psychology are called the "Paralogisms of Pure Reason." These are wrong arguments that start from the idea that the "I" or self is simple and the same throughout all of our experiences, and wrongly conclude that the soul is a real, simple, and unchanging thing that can’t be destroyed. In the first edition, there was a fourth part that tried to prove that things really exist in space by saying that objects in space are just one kind of immediate experience. This didn’t fully beat the idea that only our minds exist (called idealism), and some people accused Kant of supporting that view. So, in the second edition, Kant replaced this with the "Refutation of Idealism," which argues that objects really do exist in space and time, even if their space and time are only ways we experience them.

In the second edition, the whole chapter on paralogisms was rewritten and made simpler. To replace the old fourth part, Kant added a new argument saying that his idea of appearance versus reality helps solve the problem of how mind and body interact. Instead of thinking of mind and body as two totally different kinds of things, Kant suggests they might be two different ways of experiencing the same unknown kind of thing.
