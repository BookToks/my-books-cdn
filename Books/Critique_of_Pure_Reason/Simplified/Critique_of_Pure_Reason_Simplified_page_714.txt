Math, science, and even the knowledge people have gained from experience are very important. They help us achieve goals that matter to humans. But this only works because of clear thinking from basic ideas, which is really what metaphysics is about.

Because of this, metaphysics is the highest point of human reasoning and culture. It is necessary, even if we ignore its role as a science for specific purposes. It looks at reason itself, its parts, and its most important rules. These rules are the foundation for making some sciences possible and using them well.

Metaphysics might not help us learn more facts directly, but it helps us avoid mistakes. This makes it very valuable because it acts like a guide or a referee. It keeps scientific work organized and focused on the main goal: making everyone happier.

The last part, called "The history of pure reason," is just a place left empty in the system. It needs to be filled in later.
