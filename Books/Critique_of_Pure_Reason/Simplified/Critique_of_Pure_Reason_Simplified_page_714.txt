Mathematics, natural science, even the empirical knowledge of humankind, have a high value as means, for the most part to contingent but yet ultimately to necessary and essential ends of hu­ manity, but only through the mediation of a rational cognition from mere concepts, which, call it what one will, is really nothing but meta­ physics.
 
 Just for this reason metaphysics is also the culmination of all culture of human reason, which is indispensable even if one sets aside its influ- A8SI/B879 ence as a science for certain determinate ends. For it considers reason according to its elements and highest maxims, which must ground even the possibility of some sciences and the use of all of them. That as mere speculation it serves more to prevent errors than to amplify cognition does no damage to its value, but rather gives it all the more dignity and authority through its office as censor, which secures the general order and unity, indeed the well-being of the scientific community, and prevents its cheerful and fruitful efforts from straying from the chief end, that of the general happiness.
