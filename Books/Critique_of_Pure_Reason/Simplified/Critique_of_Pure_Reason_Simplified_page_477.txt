There are only four main ideas about the universe based on four basic categories. These ideas come from how we combine many different things we see into one complete picture.

1. The first idea is about having a totally complete set of all things we can see.

2. The second idea is about having a totally complete way to break down any appearance into parts.

3. The third idea is about fully understanding how any appearance comes to be.

4. The fourth idea is about fully understanding how things that change depend on other things to exist.

The first important point is that when we talk about an absolute total, we only mean how appearances are shown to us. This doesn’t mean the pure idea of everything that exists in general. So, appearances are taken as they are, and reason wants to know all the necessary conditions that make these appearances possible, arranged in a complete series. This series explains appearances according to rules of understanding.

Second, reason looks for something unconditioned in this chain of conditions. This means it wants a complete set of reasons that doesn’t depend on anything else. We can imagine this perfect total set, but it is just an idea. With appearances, we can’t truly know this total set ahead of time.

In summary, the idea of an absolute total is about all the parts that make up something as we see it, but it’s a tricky idea because appearances only exist as we experience them, not on their own. Also, while it’s easy to think about the world as a system of things interacting in space and time, when we think about things beyond appearances, it’s harder to explain how a world is possible. If we assume a world exists, then maybe many worlds could exist too.
