Every feeling has a certain strength or size that can fill the same amount of time, more or less, in our mind when we think about something, until it finally disappears. Because of this, there is a connection between something being real and it not being there at all. This connection lets us think of any reality as a kind of amount or quantity. How we imagine reality as an amount is by thinking about how it lasts over time, starting strong and then fading away, or coming from nothing and growing stronger.

The idea of substance means that something real stays the same over time. It’s like the basic thing that stays even when everything else changes.

Time itself doesn’t actually pass; instead, things that can change happen within time. So, time is always there and unchanging, and substance is the part that doesn’t change. Only substance can help us understand how things happen one after another or at the same time in time.

Cause and effect means that if one thing happens, something else always follows. This is about things happening in order, following a rule.

Community, or how things affect each other, means that two things can change at the same time, following a general rule about how they relate.

Possibility means that things can only happen in ways that fit with time. For example, opposites can’t happen together at the same time, but they can happen one after the other. This shows when something can happen in time.

Actuality means something exists at a specific time. Necessity means something exists at all times, no matter what.

From all this, you can see that each idea or category helps us think about time and how we experience things. For example, size or amount shows how time is created as we notice things one after the other. Quality is about how our feelings fill up time.
