If we think about substance as something that exists all the time, then all we have left is the idea of a subject, something that can be on its own and not just a quality of something else. But the problem is, I don’t even know any situation where this idea makes sense for any real thing. Also, this idea doesn’t really help us understand anything, and we can’t really use it to learn more or decide if it even means anything.

When we think about a cause just as a general idea (ignoring the time when one thing happens after another), all we know is that it lets us guess that something else exists. But this doesn’t tell us how to tell cause and effect apart. Plus, because we need certain conditions to make this guess, and we don’t know those conditions, the idea doesn’t really help us apply it to anything real.

People often say, "Everything that could happen has a cause," like it’s a big rule. But if you ask what "could happen" means, and the answer is "something that might not exist," then I want to know how you figure that out. You have to imagine things happening one after another, like something existing after not existing or changing. Just saying that something not existing doesn’t contradict itself is not enough to prove it can really not exist. I can imagine something stopping to exist in my mind without any problem, but that doesn’t mean it can actually stop existing for real.

About how things interact with each other, since we can’t clearly define substance or cause, we also can’t clearly explain how substances cause things to happen to each other.

No one has been able to clearly define ideas like possibility, existence, and necessity without just repeating the same thing in different words if they only use pure thinking.
