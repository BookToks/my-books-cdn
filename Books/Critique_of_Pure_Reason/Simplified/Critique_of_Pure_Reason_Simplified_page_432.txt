When I say "I think," it means that even though many people can have different thoughts, the "I" or the self who thinks cannot be split up or shared. This "I" is something we assume is always there when we think.

So, just like before, the idea of "I think" is the main reason why some people try to study the mind. This idea isn’t something we experience directly, but it’s the way we understand our own thinking, and it comes before any experience we have. However, we often mistake this idea as proof that there is a thinking being like ourselves everywhere. We can’t imagine a thinking being without putting ourselves in their place.

The idea that the self is simple (like a soul) isn’t something we get from saying "I think." Instead, it’s already part of every thought. Saying "I think" is just a direct way to show that we are aware of ourselves thinking. The famous phrase "I think, therefore I am" just repeats the same idea—it’s like saying "I am thinking" which already proves "I exist."

When we say "I am simple," it means that this "I" doesn’t have many parts inside it. It’s just one complete thing, but only in a logical sense.

This well-known proof about the mind is based on the idea that a thought is one whole thing that belongs to a person. But the "I" we add to our thoughts doesn’t tell us anything real about who this "I" is. It only means some unknown thing, a basic subject with no details. We think of it as simple because we don’t say anything about it. But just because the idea of the "I" is simple doesn’t mean we really know the self is simple. The word "I" is empty and can apply to any thinking being.

What we do know for sure is this: when I say "I think," I am always thinking, and this shows that I exist.
