When thinking about ideas that are just guesses, it’s only fair that we try to be honest and reasonable. If everyone could at least agree on being honest, then arguments about big questions like God, life after death, and free will would have been settled a long time ago or would end soon. Sometimes, people who argue against these ideas are actually more honest than the people who support them.

I’m talking to readers who don’t want a good cause to be defended in a bad way. For these people, it’s clear that, according to the rules of thinking carefully, there shouldn’t even be a fight about pure ideas. How can two people argue about something neither of them has seen or experienced, and only think about it to create another idea, not a real thing? They can’t prove their side for sure, so all they do is try to tear down the other person’s argument. This happens with all pure ideas because they go beyond what we can experience. Since we can’t find proof outside of experience, but still have to use the rules of thinking made for real experiences, both sides are open to attack, and each can use the other’s weaknesses against them.

We can think of the critique of pure reason like a judge for all these arguments about pure ideas. The critique doesn’t take sides about the things themselves, but instead decides what is allowed when thinking in general, based on the basic rules of reason.

Without this critique, reason is like being in a wild state with no rules, where arguments just turn into fights.

But the critique, which makes all decisions based on its own clear rules that no one can question, gives us peace, like having laws to follow, so we don’t have to keep arguing.
