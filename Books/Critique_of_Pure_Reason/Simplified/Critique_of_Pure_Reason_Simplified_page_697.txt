Chapter 2, Section 3 agrees perfectly with the moral ideas that reason gives us. So, in the end, only pure reason—used in practice—can connect our deepest interests with knowledge that just thinking about things can imagine but never prove. This makes it not a proven fact but still a necessary idea for reason’s most important goals.

Now, when practical reason reaches the idea of one original being as the highest good, it shouldn’t try to start from this idea to create moral laws. It can’t act like it’s above all real-life conditions or suddenly know new things. It was these moral laws themselves that made us believe in a self-sufficient cause or a wise ruler of the world to make these laws work. So, we can’t say these laws come from a random will, especially not a will we wouldn’t even know about if we hadn’t made it based on those laws.

Where practical reason guides us, we won’t say actions are required just because God commands them. Instead, we see them as God’s commands because we feel inside that we must follow them. We will understand freedom by looking at how reason fits everything together and believe we follow God’s will only when we respect the moral law that reason shows us from the nature of actions. We believe we serve this divine will by helping what’s best for the world in ourselves and others.

Moral theology is useful only for helping us fulfill our role in the world by fitting into the system of all goals. It’s not for blindly or disrespectfully ignoring the guidance of moral reason to connect it directly to the idea of the highest being. That kind of thinking would twist and ruin the true goals of reason, even though it might seem like a deeper way to use it.

On the Canon of Pure Reason, Third Section, about having opinions, knowing, and believing: Thinking something is true happens in our minds and can be based on real reasons but also depends on personal feelings or moral principles.
