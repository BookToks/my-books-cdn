But shouldn't young people who are learning in school be warned about these kinds of writings? They should be protected from seeing dangerous ideas too early, until their judgment is strong enough. Or until they have learned certain important ideas well enough to resist any arguments that try to change their minds.

If pure reason had to be taught by strict rules, and if opponents had to be fought against like in a battle using proof to win, then it might make sense to keep young minds protected and away from these tricky ideas for a while. But if later on, because of curiosity or trends, they do come across these ideas, will their beliefs still hold up? Someone who only knows strict rules to fight back, and doesn’t understand how to think through arguments deeply, will be fooled by new but weak ideas. They might think they show they are mature by ignoring warnings, but really they’re just filling their minds with harmful beliefs.

What should really happen in education is the opposite of this. But this only works if the student first learns how to carefully think about reason itself.

To practice these ideas early and show that they work against tricky arguments, students need to face these challenges. Even if their reason is still weak, if they have learned to think critically, they can test each weak argument and see why it doesn’t hold up. This helps them feel confident to protect themselves from deception. In the end, those false arguments will lose all their power over them. But then the same ideas that break down others’ arguments also help build up their own understanding.
