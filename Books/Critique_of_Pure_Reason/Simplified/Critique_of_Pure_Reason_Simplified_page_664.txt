But should not the young, at least, who are entrusted to academic in­ struction, be warned about writings of that sort, and be protected from premature acquaintance with such dangerous propositions, until their power of judgment has matured or rather the doctrine that one would ground in them has become firmly rooted, in order vigorously to resist all persuasion to the contrary, from wherever it might come?
 
 If matters of pure reason had to be left to dogmatic procedures, and if the opponents really had to be disposed of polemically, i.e., in such a way that one must enter into battle armed with grounds of proof against opposed assertions, then nothing would be more advisable in the short run, but at the same time nothing more vain and fruitless in the long run, than to place the reason of the young under tutelage for a long time and protect it against seduction for at least as long. But when, sub­ sequently, either curiosity or the fashion of the age should put writings of that sort in their hands, would that youthful persuasion then hold fast? He who brings with him nothing but dogmatic weapons to resist the attacks of his opponent, and who does not know how to develop the hidden dialectic which lies no less in his own breast than in that of his A 7551B 783 counterpart, sees illusory grounds that have the advantage of novelty step forth against illusory grounds that no longer have that advantage but which instead arouse the suspicion of having abused the credulity of the young. He believes that he cannot better show that he has outgrown the discipline of childhood than by setting himself above those well-intended warnings, and, accustomed to dogmatism, he takes long drafts of the poison that dogmatically corrupts his principles.
 
 Exactly the opposite of that which has just been recommended must take place in academic education, although, to be sure, only under the presupposition of a thorough instruction in the critique of pure reason.
 
 For in order to put the principleso of the latter into practice as early as possible and to show their adequacy against the greatest dialectical illu­ sion, it is absolutely necessary to direct the attacks that would be so fearsome for the dogmatist against the reason of the student, which is still weak but is enlightened by critique, and allow him to make the ex­ periment of examining the groundless assertions of his opponents one by one in light of those principles. It cannot be difficult for him to dis­ solve those arguments into thin air, and thus he feels early his own power to defend himself fully against harmful deceptions of that sort, which must in the end lose all their plausibilityb for him. But now whether the very same blows that bring down the edifice of the enemy A756/B784 Principien a b Schein 651 Doctrine of Method.
