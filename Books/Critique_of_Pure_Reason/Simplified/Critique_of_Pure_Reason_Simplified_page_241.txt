If our mind were completely separate from everything else, we would never have knowledge, which comes from connecting and comparing different ideas. I say that sense has a way of putting things together because it takes in many different details at once. But to actually know something, these details have to be combined by both receiving information and actively organizing it. This leads to three important ways our mind works in all knowledge: first, noticing ideas as they come into our mind; second, remembering them through imagination; and third, recognizing them by understanding their meaning. These three parts come from different sources in our mind, and they help us understand things and have experiences.

Before going deeper, it’s important to know that explaining how we understand categories (basic ideas) is really hard. It requires digging deep into how our knowledge is even possible. To keep things clear and not too long, I decided to give a short introduction first in the next few parts. Then, I will explain everything step-by-step in the next big section. So, don’t get discouraged if it feels confusing now—it will become clearer later.

1. The way we notice things in our mind.

No matter where our ideas come from—whether from outside things or from inside our own thoughts, whether from what we know before or what we learn from experience—they all happen inside our inner sense. This inner sense works with time, which is the framework where all our ideas must be arranged and connected. This is an important basic point for everything that follows.

Every idea we have includes many parts, but we only see them as separate because our mind notices the order in which they happen over time. If they didn’t happen one after another, we wouldn’t be able to tell them apart.
