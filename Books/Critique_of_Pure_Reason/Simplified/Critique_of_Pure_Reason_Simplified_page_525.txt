The self we experience through different states over time is not the real self by itself, or the true subject beyond experience. Instead, it’s just how this unknown being appears to us through our senses.

This inner appearance can't be said to exist on its own because it depends on time, and time can’t define anything by itself. However, in space and time, the truth of what we see and feel is reliable and can be clearly separated from dreams if we connect everything correctly according to how experience works.

So, the things we experience are never given to us on their own, but only through experience. They don’t exist outside of it.

We can admit that there might be people living on the moon, even though no one has ever seen them. This only means that in the future, we might meet them through experience. Everything real is connected to what we can perceive following the rules of experience.

This means they are real when they are part of a connection with my real consciousness, but that doesn’t mean they are real by themselves, outside of experience.

The only things truly given to us are our perceptions and how these perceptions connect to other possible perceptions. Appearances are only real when we perceive them. To say an appearance is real before we perceive it either means we will eventually perceive it or it doesn’t mean anything.

Saying it exists by itself without any relation to our senses or experience could only make sense if we were talking about a thing as it really is, beyond appearances.

But here, we are only talking about appearances in space and time. Space and time are not properties of things themselves but only of how we sense things. So, what exists in space and time (appearances) are just images or ideas in our minds, and if we don’t perceive them, they don’t exist anywhere.

Our senses only receive impressions in certain ways, and the way these impressions relate to each other is through space and time, which are pure forms of how we sense things. When these impressions connect and can be measured in space and time, we can understand them clearly.
