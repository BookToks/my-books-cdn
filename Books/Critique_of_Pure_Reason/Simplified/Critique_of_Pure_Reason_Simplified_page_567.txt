The principle of thoroughgoing determination is about the actual content of things, not just how we think about them logically. It means putting together all the qualities that define a thing completely, not just looking at opposite traits one by one. It assumes there is a basic material of all possibilities that gives us, from the start, the information needed to understand how anything can be possible.

When we say "Everything that exists is thoroughly determined," we mean that out of every pair of opposite qualities, one must always apply to that thing. This isn’t just about comparing qualities logically, but about comparing the thing itself with all the possible qualities it could have. To fully know a thing, you have to understand everything possible about it and decide whether each quality does or doesn’t belong to it.

Because of this, thoroughgoing determination is an idea we can’t fully show in real life all at once. It’s based on a concept that only our reason can hold, which tells our understanding how to use it completely.

Even though this idea of all possibilities is still unclear by itself, and we only see it as a general collection of all possible qualities, it actually rules out some qualities that can’t fit together. When we look closer, this idea becomes very specific and exact before we even experience anything, turning into the idea of a fully determined individual thing. This kind of idea is what pure reason creates.

If we think about all possible qualities not just logically but deeply, considering their actual content, everything is connected through the shared base of all possibilities. This means every concept is connected by the rule that one of two opposite qualities must apply, but the full determination of a thing depends on all possible qualities together.
