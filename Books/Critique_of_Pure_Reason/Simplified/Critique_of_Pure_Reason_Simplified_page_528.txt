When we try to understand something, we naturally follow the idea that every thing has a reason or condition behind it. We keep looking for these reasons as far as we can, connecting each idea to what causes it.

If both the thing and its cause really exist, then when the first thing is given, the cause is also given in a way. Since this is true for every part in the chain, the whole chain of causes, including the ultimate cause, is also given or assumed. This way of thinking is just how our understanding works, showing things as they really are without worrying about how we actually know them.

But if we are dealing with appearances—things as we see or experience them—then we can’t say the same. Appearances aren’t really given to us unless we experience them directly. So, if an appearance exists, it doesn’t mean all its causes (also appearances) are given too. We can’t assume the whole chain of these causes is complete.

Appearances happen only when we put together our experiences in space and time. The chain of causes for appearances is formed during this process, not before. So, when we look for causes, it’s something we do as we go, not something already given.

Because of this, when we argue about causes in this way, we make a mistake. The big assumption treats the thing as a pure idea, but the smaller step treats it as just an appearance. This mix-up causes a trick in reasoning, called a “fallacy of equivocation.” It’s not a tricky lie but a natural mistake that happens when we think about causes. We tend to assume causes exist without really checking carefully.
