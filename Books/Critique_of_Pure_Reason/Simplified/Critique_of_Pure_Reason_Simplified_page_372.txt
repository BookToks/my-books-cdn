Thinking means connecting what we see or feel to an idea or object. If we don’t have a way to experience this connection, the object only exists as a general idea, not something real we can understand clearly. When we use pure ideas or categories without any connection to what we sense, we don’t get a real object, just a general thought about objects.

To use an idea properly, we need a way to judge or recognize when something fits that idea. If this way of judging is missing, then we can’t put anything under that idea. So, just having pure ideas without any way to connect them to what we experience doesn’t really help us understand anything specific.

Because of this, pure ideas alone can’t give us true knowledge about things before we experience them. The rules we get from pure thinking only work when we have real experiences. Outside of what we can experience, there are no solid rules from pure thinking.

In short, pure ideas without any link to what we sense only have a general meaning but no real use. They can’t be applied to any real object by themselves. They are just the basic way our mind works when thinking about objects, but they don’t help us understand any object without experience.

Still, this can be confusing because these pure ideas don’t come from what we sense, unlike space and time, which come from our senses.
