Part II, Division I, Book I, Chapter I says that a statement is already connected to how we understand things based on certain rules. A statement that is definitely true thinks of a statement that is just assumed true as something decided by these rules in our mind. This shows that the truth is necessary and certain. 

Since everything here is slowly built into how we understand, we first think about something as a question, then accept it as true, and finally say it must be true and connected to how we think. These three ways of thinking about truth can be seen as different stages of thinking in general.

In Section BI02, about discovering pure ideas in our understanding, itâ€™s explained that regular logic ignores what we actually know and waits for ideas to come from somewhere else to turn them into concepts by analyzing them. But transcendental logic already has a bunch of basic feelings or senses before any experience, given by something called transcendental aesthetics. This gives pure ideas something to work with, or else they would be empty.

Space and time are examples of these basic senses that come before experience. They are part of how our mind takes in information and must always affect how we think about things. Our active thinking needs to work through these senses, take in the pieces, and put them together in a certain way to create knowledge. This process is called synthesis.

Synthesis, in the broadest sense, means putting different ideas together and understanding their variety as one thought. This is called pure synthesis if the pieces come not from experience but from what we know before experience, like space and time. Before we can analyze what we think, these ideas must be given to us, and no concepts can be formed just by analyzing what we have not yet received.
