Critiquing all kinds of speculative theology (which means studying our inner nature) is not only really important, but also a responsibility for a philosopher. It was necessary to carefully look at all the pointless ideas of speculative thinking, starting from the very basics.

Because these tricky mistakes can fool our judgment and are also interesting and natural for us to believe in, they will probably keep happening in the future. So, it was a good idea to collect all these mistakes in one place and save them in the records of human reason. This way, people can avoid making the same errors again later.
