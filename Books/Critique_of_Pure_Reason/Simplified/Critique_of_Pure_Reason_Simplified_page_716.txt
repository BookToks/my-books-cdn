The first group said that reality is only what we can see, hear, or touch, and everything else is just imagination. The second group disagreed, saying that our senses only show us appearances, and true knowledge comes from understanding. The first group didn’t deny that the mind has ideas, but they thought these ideas were just logical, while the second group saw them as deeper and more mysterious. The first group accepted ideas but believed only things we can sense are real. The second group said real things are only understood by the mind, without any help from the senses, which they thought only make things confusing.

Next, about where pure knowledge comes from—whether it comes from experience or from reason alone. Aristotle is seen as the leader of those who believe knowledge comes from experience, and Plato leads those who think knowledge comes from reason. Locke followed Aristotle’s view, and Leibniz followed Plato’s, but neither could settle the argument. Epicurus was more consistent with his belief in sense experience because he never went beyond what could be experienced. Aristotle and Locke, especially Locke, said all ideas come from experience but then tried to prove things like God’s existence and the soul’s immortality, even though these ideas can’t be proven by experience.

Finally, about method. To have a method means to follow certain rules. There are two main methods in natural knowledge: naturalistic and scientific. The naturalist of pure reason believes that common sense, without science, can answer big questions better than careful thinking can. For example, they say we can measure the moon better by looking than by math. This is a wrong way of thinking and is silly because it ignores all helpful tools. We can’t blame naturalists too much since they just follow common sense without deeper understanding.
