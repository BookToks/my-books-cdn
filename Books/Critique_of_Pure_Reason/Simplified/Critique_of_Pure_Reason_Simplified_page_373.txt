They seem to allow ideas to apply beyond everything we can sense. But these ideas are just ways we think, which only help us organize what we see or feel before we actually experience it. If we take away the way we sense things, these ideas don’t mean much, even less than the basic ways we sense objects, because at least those give us something real to experience. A kind of mental combination by itself doesn’t mean anything unless it’s connected to what we can actually sense.

If we call some things "appearances" or "things we can sense" (phenomena) because we experience them in a certain way but don’t know what they are like inside, then it follows that we can think about other things differently. These other things, which we only think about but don’t see or sense, are called "things of understanding" (noumena). The question is: Do our pure ideas about understanding mean anything when it comes to these noumena? Can we actually know anything about them?

Right from the start, there is a tricky problem that can cause confusion. When our understanding calls something a "phenomenon" (something we can sense), it also makes a mental image of a thing as it really is, beyond what we see. It thinks it can understand that real thing through ideas alone. But since our understanding only uses certain basic categories to think about objects, it can be fooled into thinking it knows something definite about these real things outside our senses, which it actually doesn’t.

If we say a "noumenon" is a thing that we don’t sense because we ignore how we sense it, then it’s a noumenon in a "negative" way. But if we think of a noumenon as an object we can know by some kind of non-sensory way of sensing — like a special kind of "intellectual intuition" — then we assume a kind of knowing that we don’t have, and can’t really understand. This would be a noumenon in a "positive" way.
