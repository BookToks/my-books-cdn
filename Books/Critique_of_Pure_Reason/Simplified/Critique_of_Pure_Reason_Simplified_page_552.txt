Using the rule that every event has a cause, and that these causes connect naturally, doesn’t have to stop us from thinking that some causes might be different. These special causes might not be physical or natural but could come from something you can only understand with your mind, not your senses. Even though we can’t see or touch them, they still fit with how things appear to us.

We need the idea that events have natural causes so we can look for and explain what makes things happen in the world around us. If we agree with this and don’t make exceptions, then science and understanding work just fine. They explain everything based on natural causes without any problems.

This doesn’t change if we imagine that some natural causes actually come from something that’s only understood by the mind, not by experience. These causes don’t depend on what we see or touch but on how the mind works. Still, their effects in the world follow the natural laws we know.

So, the person causing something in the world would have their actions connected to the natural chain of causes we observe. But underneath, there might be a deeper, invisible cause that we can only understand with our mind, not with our senses. When we study nature, we only need to follow the natural causes we can see and don’t have to worry about what’s behind them in this deeper sense, which we can’t know for sure.

This deeper cause doesn’t affect what we can see or test but might exist just as an idea in our understanding. Even if this deeper cause is behind what happens, everything we experience can still be fully explained by natural causes. The deeper cause is unknown except for the signs it leaves in the natural world.

If we think about experience, humans are part of the natural world and act like other natural causes we can observe.
