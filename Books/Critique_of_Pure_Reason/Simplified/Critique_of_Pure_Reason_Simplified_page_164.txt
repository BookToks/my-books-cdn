The analysis is complete and the ideas that will be explained later will be easy to finish as long as they cover everything needed and nothing is missing.

The critique of pure reason includes everything about transcendental philosophy. It shows the full idea of this philosophy but isn’t the complete science itself. It only goes as far as needed to fully understand certain kinds of knowledge.

The main point is that no ideas based on experience should be part of this science. The knowledge must be completely pure. So, even though the main rules of morality come from pure knowledge, they don’t belong in transcendental philosophy. This is because practical things are connected to feelings, which come from experience, not pure reason.

If we want to organize this science, it will have two main parts: a Doctrine of Elements and a Doctrine of Method of pure reason. Each part will have smaller sections, but the reasons for these can’t be explained yet. What’s important to know first is that human knowledge comes from two sources, which might come from the same unknown origin: sensibility and understanding. Sensibility gives us objects, and understanding helps us think about them.
