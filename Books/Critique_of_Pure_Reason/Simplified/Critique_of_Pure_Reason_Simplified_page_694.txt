Practical laws, when they also guide our personal actions, are called maxims. Moral judgments about how pure and effective something is happen based on ideas, while following moral laws happens based on maxims. Our whole life should follow moral maxims, but this can only happen if reason connects with the moral law. This moral law is just an idea, but it causes our actions to lead to the best results, matching our highest goals, whether in this life or another. Without believing in God and a world we can’t see now but hope for, the great ideas of morality are things we admire but don’t have the power to push us to act, because they wouldn’t fulfill the full purpose that every logical being naturally has through pure reason.

Happiness alone isn’t the complete good for our reason. Reason doesn’t approve of happiness by itself, even if we really want it, unless it comes with being worthy of happiness through good moral behavior. But just being moral and worthy of happiness isn’t the full good either. To have the full good, someone who has acted morally must be able to hope to enjoy happiness. Even reason, without selfish goals, can’t think differently if it imagines itself as someone who has to give happiness to others. In the practical idea, both being moral and having happiness are linked. But the moral attitude must happen first to make happiness possible, not the other way around. If happiness came first, the attitude wouldn’t really be moral and wouldn’t deserve full happiness, which only has limits based on our own bad actions.

So, happiness that matches how moral a person is—that is, how worthy they are of it—is the highest good for rational beings.
