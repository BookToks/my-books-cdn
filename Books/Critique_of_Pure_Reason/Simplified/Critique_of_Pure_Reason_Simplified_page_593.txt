Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III talks about how we learn about nature by following a clear idea that comes from outside nature itself. But this understanding also affects the original idea that caused it, making us believe even more strongly in a highest creator until that belief feels impossible to ignore.

So, it wouldn’t make sense to try to take away from the strength of this proof. Our reason, which keeps getting stronger thanks to real evidence we find in the world, can’t be stopped by any tricky or complicated doubts. Just like waking up from a dream, when we look at the amazing details of nature and the grand design of the world, our reason lifts us higher and higher until we reach the idea of the greatest cause—the one who is uncaused and supreme.

Even though this way of thinking is smart and helpful, we shouldn’t say it proves everything perfectly or that it needs no other support. It’s better to speak about it with modesty, as a belief that comforts us but doesn’t force everyone to accept it without question. That means the physico-theological proof can’t prove the highest being exists by itself. It always needs the ontological proof (which it just introduces) to fill in what it can’t prove. The ontological proof is the only real argument that no one can avoid if they think carefully.

The main ideas of the physico-theological proof are these: First, everywhere in the world, we see clear signs of order and purpose, done with great skill, in a huge and complex way. Second, this purposeful order doesn’t come from the things in the world themselves. The different parts couldn’t work together so well to reach certain goals unless they were chosen and set up by a rational principle outside themselves.
