All the different ways we understand things happening over time need to be connected in one clear way. This connection happens in our mind before we even experience anything. It makes sure everything we notice fits together so we can understand it as one whole. This connection follows certain rules about how time works, and the rules we’ll talk about now follow those same ideas.

These rules don’t focus on what things look like or how we first notice them. Instead, they focus on whether things actually exist and how they relate to each other because they exist. How we see something can be figured out in advance, so the way we put it together in our mind matches what we will actually experience. But we can’t know for sure if something exists just by thinking about it before seeing it, and even if we guessed it did, we still couldn’t know exactly what makes that thing different from others.

The two rules I talked about before, which I called mathematical because they let us use math with what we see, only deal with what could possibly appear. They explain how we can create the image or feeling of something using math rules, like measuring its size or amount. For example, I could figure out how bright sunlight feels by adding up about 200,000 times the light from the moon. So, we call those rules “constitutive” because they help build up how we understand things.

But rules that tell us if something really exists are very different. Since we can’t create existence by thinking about it, these rules only tell us how things that do exist relate to each other. They don’t give us exact facts or pictures before we see things. Instead, if we already have one experience, these rules tell us how another experience must happen in time with the first one, even if we don’t know exactly what that other experience is like. In philosophy, the word “analogies” means something quite different from how it is used in math.
