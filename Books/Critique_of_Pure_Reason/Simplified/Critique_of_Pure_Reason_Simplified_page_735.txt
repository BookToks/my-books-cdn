21 Look again at R 5320 (1776-78,18:151).

22 This isn’t totally honest: Lambert at least made it clear that his doubts about Kant’s idea of time also apply to space.

He wrote: "The reality of time and space seems so simple and so different from everything else that you can only think about it, not really define it... So I can’t say that time and space are just tools to help us understand things" (letter from 13 October 1770, 10:107).

23 For the whole paragraph, compare R 4673 (1773-75, 17:636-42).

24 Here Kant talks about Newton’s idea of absolute space, which was also supported by people like Samuel Clarke. Newton’s ideas about absolute space and time are found in his book *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (London, 1687), in the Scholium to Definition VIII, book I. Clarke discussed these ideas in his replies during the Leibniz-Clarke debate, which took place in 1715 and 1716. These letters were later published in different editions in German and French.

It’s clear that Kant knew a lot about this famous argument.

25 Here Kant refers to Leibniz and his followers’ views. He had already pointed out a key problem with Leibniz’s view, focusing on how we know things rather than the nature of things themselves (which Kant mostly agreed with), in his first dissertation, § 15D (2:404). See also R 5298 (1776-1780s, 18:146-7), R 5327 (1776-1780s, 18:153), and R 5876 (1783-84, 18:374-5).

26 See R 4652 (1772-78, 17:626). Also check *Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science*, 4:476-7.

27 For a classic explanation of the view Kant is arguing against, see G. W. Leibniz’s *New Essays on Human Understanding*, book I, chapter I, § 11: "Ideas from the senses are unclear; so are some of the truths based on them. But intellectual ideas and their truths are clear and don’t come from the senses, even though without the senses we wouldn’t think of them" (translated by Jonathan Bennett and Peter Remnant, Cambridge University Press, 1981, p. 81).

28 For a similar passage, also using a triangle as an example, see Kant’s letter to Marcus Herz on 26 May 1789 (letter 362, II:48-55; translated in Arnulf Zweig, *Kant: Philosophical Correspondence 1759-99*, University of Chicago Press, 1967, pp. 150-6).

29 Compare this whole section to R 5637 (1780-83 or 1785-88, 18:268-76). These are probably drafts for the first or second edition of the *Critique*.
