Like I said before, this division is the reason Kant splits the "Transcendental Doctrine of Elements" into two parts: the "Transcendental Aesthetic," which looks at how we sense things and the pure form of that, and the "Transcendental Logic," which studies how we understand and judge, including both fake and real ways of reasoning.

The "Transcendental Aesthetic" talks about space, time, and something called transcendental idealism. Even though it's short—only about thirty pages in the first edition and forty in the second—it has some bold, surprising ideas that shape the whole rest of the Critique and have been studied a lot for the last two hundred years. In this part, Kant tries to separate what we learn from our senses from what comes just from the things themselves. He says space and time are pure forms of how we sense things, and we can know this before any experience. This idea helps solve an old argument between two groups: the Newtonians, who thought space and time exist on their own, and the Leibnizians, who thought space and time are just ways we relate things to each other. Kant offers a different view: space and time aren’t things on their own or inside the things themselves, but are just the way our senses organize what we experience. This is why space and time show up in all experience as endless but unified ways of measuring things. Newton tried to explain this by saying space and time are like God’s own space, but that didn’t make sense. Kant also explains why math about space and time is definitely true even though Leibniz said space and time are only relations between objects.

Because Kant says space and time are pure ways we sense things, he comes to a strange conclusion: space and time are real for us in experience but are also “transcendentally ideal.” That means we only talk about space, time, and the way things exist in space and time from a human point of view. We don’t know these things as they really are on their own, but only as they appear to us through our senses.
