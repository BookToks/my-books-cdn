When we understand things, our mind takes in pieces of information that come from what we sense. These pieces have to be connected in one clear thought, or else we can’t really understand them. If the ideas weren’t connected, we wouldn’t be able to think about them all at once in a way that makes sense.

Understanding is basically our ability to know and make sense of things.

This happens when we relate what we sense to an object. An object is something that brings together all the different pieces of what we sense into one idea. But to do this, our mind has to unite all these pieces in one clear awareness. This unity is what makes the ideas about the object real and true, and it’s also what lets us understand anything at all.

The first and most important idea behind understanding is that our mind has to connect all these pieces into one clear thought. This idea doesn’t depend on what we sense with our body. For example, space itself isn’t something we understand yet; it just gives us a place where we might sense things.

To understand something in space, like a line, I have to create it in my mind by connecting the pieces in a specific way. This connection is what makes the line a real object in my mind. The way our mind connects these pieces is necessary for us to understand anything as an object. Without this, the pieces would just be random and not form a clear idea.

This is important because it means all the things we sense must be connected in one clear thought for us to call them objects. This connection is original and necessary for thinking, and it shows how all our ideas are linked together in our mind.
