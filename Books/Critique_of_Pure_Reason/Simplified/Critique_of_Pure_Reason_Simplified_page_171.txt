Part I. The Transcendental Aesthetic

Space is something we understand before we even experience anything outside ourselves. It’s a basic way our mind organizes what we see and feel around us.

You can’t imagine there being no space at all, even if you think there are no objects inside it. So, space isn’t something that depends on things appearing; it’s the condition that makes those appearances possible.

Because of this, all the rules in geometry, like how lines and shapes work, are absolutely certain and come from this basic idea of space.

If space was just an idea we got from experience, then math wouldn’t be certain. It would just be based on what we’ve seen so far, and things like the idea that only one straight line connects two points wouldn’t have to be true all the time.

Space isn’t just a general idea about how things relate to each other. Instead, it’s a special kind of “intuition” — which means we directly understand it in our mind.

There is only one space, and when we talk about different spaces, we really mean different parts of the same one space. These parts don’t come before the whole space; they exist inside it.

In short, space is not something we learn from experience. It’s a basic way our mind shapes everything we experience outside ourselves.
