The idea of sensibility is connected to the idea of the noumenon, but in a negative way. This means thinking about things not just as they appear to us, but as they are on their own. However, when we think like this, we can’t use our usual categories or ways of understanding because these only work when we relate things to how we experience space and time.

Our categories make sense only because space and time are just ways we organize what we see and feel. If something doesn’t fit into this time and space, like a noumenon, then the categories don’t work at all. We can’t even understand if such things are possible just by thinking about them.

To prove something is possible, we need to have some kind of experience or intuition of it, not just a concept that doesn’t contradict itself. If we tried to use our categories on things that aren’t appearances, we’d need a different kind of intuition, one that isn’t based on our senses. This would be a “positive” noumenon.

But since we don’t have this kind of intellectual intuition, our categories can’t go beyond what we experience. Even if there are beings we can’t sense, our way of thinking based on our senses doesn’t reach them. So, when we talk about noumenons, we only mean it in a negative way — things we can’t experience or understand fully.

If we take away all thinking about objects from our experience, then we have no knowledge of anything at all. Just having sensations doesn’t mean we understand or relate to anything outside ourselves.
