a Now the doctrine of sensibility is at the same time the doctrine of the noumenon in the negative sense, i.e., of things that the understanding must think without this relation to our kind of intuition, thus not merely as appearances but as things in themselves, but about which, however, it also understands that in this abstractionb it cannot consider B 308 making any use of its categories, since they have significance only in relation to the unity of intuitions in space and time, and can even determine this unity a priori through general concepts of combination only on account of the mere ideality of space and time. Where this temporal unity cannot be encountered, thus in the case of the noumenon, there the entire use, indeed even all significance of the categories completely ceases; for then we could not have insight even into the possibility of the things that would correspond to the categories; on this score I need only appeal to that which I adduced right at the beginning of the general remark to the previous chapter.96 Now, however, the possibility of a thing can never be proved merely through the non-contraÂ­ dictoriness of a concept of it, but only by vouching for it with an intuition corresponding to this concept. If, therefore, we wanted to apply the categories to objects that are not considered as appearances, then we would have to ground them on an intuition other than the sensible one, and then the object would be a noumenon in a positive sense. Now since such an intuition, namely intellectual intuition, lies c absolutely outside our faculty of cognition, the use of the categories can by no means reach beyond the boundaries of the objects of experience; and although beings of understanding certainly correspond to the beings of sense, and there may even be beings of understanding to which B 309 our sensible faculty of intuition has no relation at all, our concepts of understanding, as mere forms of thought for our sensible intuition, do not reach these in the least; thus that which we call noumenon must be understood to be such only in a negative sense .d> eIf I take all thinking (through categories) away from an empirical A253 cognition, then no cognition of any object at all remains; for through mere intuition nothing at all is thought, and that this affection of sensibility is in me does not constitute any relation of such representation Bedeutung n Absonderung b , Bedeutung Bedeutung d , From this point on the text of the first edition is preserved in the second with only one change on BpI and one added footnote on B3I2.
