This part talks about how we use our understanding to think about things. For example, when we say "Every metal is a body," we are making a possible judgment about objects. To understand how our mind works, we need to look at all the ways we connect ideas in judgments. The next section will show that this is pretty easy to do.

Now, let's focus on how the mind works in making judgments. If we ignore what the judgment is about and just look at how the mind thinks, we find that there are four main types of thinking. Each type has three parts. These types can be shown in a table.

The four types are: Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Modality. For Quantity, judgments can be universal, particular, or singular. For Quality, they can be affirmative, negative, or infinite. For Relation, they can be categorical, hypothetical, or disjunctive. For Modality, they can be problematic, assertoric, or apodictic.

This way of dividing things is a bit different from what other logicians usually say, but the differences are not very important. Itâ€™s just a different way to explain how we think.
