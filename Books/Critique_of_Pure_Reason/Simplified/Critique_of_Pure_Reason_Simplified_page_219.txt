The functions of the understanding can therefore all be found together if one can exhaustively exhibit the func­ tions of unity in judgments. The following section will make it evident that this can readily be accomplished.
 
 On the Clue to the Discovery of all Pure Concepts of the Understanding Second Section <§ 9.> a On the logical function of the understanding in judgments.
 
 If we abstract from all content of a judgment in general, and attend only to the mere form of the understanding in it, we find that the function of thinking in that can be brought under four titles, each of which con­ tains under itself three moments. They can suitably be represented in the following table.6 I.

 a Here Kant resumes the numbering of paragraphs begun in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" in the second edition. This will continue through the end of the "Transcen­ dental Deduction." b Here Kant uses the latinate word Relation instead of either Beziehung or Verhidtnis.
