When philosophy argues with math, it’s usually because it forgets that math only deals with how things appear and the rules about those appearances. Here, it’s not enough to just understand the idea of a simple thing when thinking about a complex one. You also need to be able to imagine a simple thing when imagining a complex one, and that’s impossible when dealing with things we sense.

For something made of parts that we think about with understanding, it might be true that before putting parts together, there is something simple. But this doesn’t work for things we see in space, because space itself doesn’t have any simple parts. Monadists try to get around this by saying space depends on the things in it, not the other way around. But since we only know bodies as things that appear in space, this idea doesn’t really work. If these things were things in themselves, then the monadists’ idea would make sense.

The second tricky idea is different because it tries to prove something real from experience: that the “I” who thinks is a simple substance. Without going into too much detail, if we only think of “I” as just a thought without any other details, we can’t see any parts or pieces. Since the way we think about ourselves comes only from inner feelings, we can’t find any real parts inside us. So, self-awareness is special because the person thinking is also the thing being thought about, and it can’t be broken into parts.
