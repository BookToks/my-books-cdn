Using the rule about how we understand the world doesn’t work by itself because what we see isn’t the real thing itself. For us to see the world having clear limits, like an edge in empty time or space, we would have to actually experience those edges. But having an experience with nothing in it at all is impossible. So, the world can’t have a definite boundary that we can experience, and it’s impossible to have one at all.

This means something important: the chain of things we see in the world goes on forever. The world we sense doesn’t have a set size. When we try to understand the world by looking at one thing after another, we always move from one thing to something further away or more remote—whether by our own experience, history, or cause-and-effect. But we never go beyond what we can possibly understand, because using reason helps us move step by step through what we can experience.

What isn’t required here is that this chain of things always continues in one specific way without stopping. For example, you don’t have to always go back through a person’s family tree forever without finding a first ancestor, or always assume there’s an outermost sun in space. Instead, what matters is just moving from one appearance to the next, even if some of those appearances are too weak for us to fully notice or experience. They still count as possible experiences.

Every beginning happens in time, and every boundary happens in space. But time and space only exist in the world we sense. So, appearances only exist because of the world, but the world itself doesn’t have limits or conditions in an absolute way.

Because of this, and because we can’t see the whole world at once, or even see the whole chain of causes and conditions that make up the world, the idea of the world’s size can’t be fully understood.
