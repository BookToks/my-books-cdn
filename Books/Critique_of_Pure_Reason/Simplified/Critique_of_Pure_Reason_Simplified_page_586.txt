It's impossible to prove the universe exists just by thinking about it because to do that, you have to get rid of every condition or reason, but without those, you can’t really understand anything for sure. When you reach that point where nothing more makes sense, you just assume you’ve finished your idea.

People often mix up the idea that it’s logically possible for everything to be connected without contradictions, with the idea that such a connection is actually possible in real life. But to prove it’s really possible, you need a rule or principle, and that only works when you think about things we can experience.

The trick with trying to prove God or a necessary being exists using cosmological arguments is just to avoid proving it purely by thinking about concepts, which is really hard to do. Instead, we look at the fact that something exists and try to figure out what must be absolutely necessary for that existence.

Once we know this necessary thing exists, we don’t have to explain how it could be possible. If it’s proven to exist, the question of its possibility doesn’t matter. When we try to understand this necessary being better, we don’t try to prove from its concept alone that it must exist, because if we could, we wouldn’t need to start from experience in the first place. Instead, we look for what conditions must be true so that this being is absolutely necessary.

This works in many cases when we want to find what causes something, but here, the condition needed for absolute necessity can only be found in one being. This being must have everything in its idea that makes it absolutely necessary, so we should be able to say for sure that this being must exist just by understanding it. But if we can’t do that—if we can’t prove it exists just by thinking—then we fail and end up back at the start.

The idea of the highest being answers all questions about what it is like just by thinking about it, making it a perfect idea. It’s unique among all possible things. But this idea doesn’t actually prove that it exists, which is the whole point we wanted to figure out. People who believe a necessary being exists want to know which thing it is, but this idea doesn’t help with that.
