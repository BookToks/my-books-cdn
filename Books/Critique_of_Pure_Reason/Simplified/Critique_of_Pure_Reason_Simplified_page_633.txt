The idea is based completely on how our reason uses it to understand the world. But if we tried to say it is absolutely true on its own, we would forget that we are only thinking about a being as an idea. Since we started with something we can’t fully figure out by looking at the world, we wouldn’t be able to properly use this idea when we think about real things.

But you might ask, can I still use the idea of a highest being when I think about the world in a logical way? Yes, that’s exactly why we use this idea in reason. Can I think of order and purpose in the world as if they come from a divine will, even if it’s only through things set up in the world? Yes, you can, but it doesn’t really matter if you say “God wisely planned it” or “Nature wisely arranged it.” What’s important is that you see a clear, purposeful order.

The biggest and most organized unity that your reason looks for is what lets you use the idea of a highest intelligence as a guide in studying nature. The more you see purpose in the world following this idea, the more you confirm that it’s a good idea. But since this idea only aims to find the greatest possible unity in nature, we can thank the idea of a highest being for how far we get, but we can’t ignore the natural laws. We can’t say this purpose comes from outside nature without contradicting ourselves because these laws are what make the idea useful. We don’t have proof of a being above nature with special powers, but we use the idea of such a being to help us understand things better.
