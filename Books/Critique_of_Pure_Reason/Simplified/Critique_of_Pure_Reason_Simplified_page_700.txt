In the first example, my assumption and believing some things to be true is just a guess. But in the second example, it is a belief I have to have. A doctor must do something for a sick person who is in danger, even if he doesn’t know exactly what the illness is. He looks at the symptoms and decides, because he doesn’t know anything better, that it might be consumption. His belief is just a guess, even in his own mind; someone else might be able to do better. I call these kinds of guesses that still help us take action “pragmatic beliefs.”

A good way to tell if someone really believes something or is just trying to convince you is to see if they would bet on it.

Sometimes people say things so confidently that it seems like they don’t care if they’re wrong. But if you ask them to bet, they get nervous. Sometimes they are willing to bet a little money but not a lot. For example, they might bet one coin but not ten because then they realize it’s possible they could be wrong. If we thought about betting our whole life on something, our confidence would disappear, and we’d get scared because the belief isn’t that strong. So, pragmatic belief can be stronger or weaker depending on what’s at risk.

Even if we can’t do anything about something, and believing it is just theoretical, we can still imagine a situation where we would have good reason to believe it if we could find a way to be sure. So, in theoretical judgments, there are beliefs similar to practical ones, which I call “doctrinal beliefs.” For example, if it were possible to prove if there are people living on other planets, I might bet everything I have on it. That means it is not just an opinion but a strong belief—one I would bet a lot on—that there are people living on other worlds.
