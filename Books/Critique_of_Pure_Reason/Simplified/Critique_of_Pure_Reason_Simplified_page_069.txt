In 1776-77, Kant was still working on his ideas. By 1775, he had only gotten so far. Around 1776-77, he made some notes that looked like a plan for a whole book. In the first note, Kant divided his plan into four parts: "Dialectic of Sensibility"; "Dialectic of Understanding - Transcendental Theory of Magnitude"; "Transcendental Theory of Appearance - Reality and Negation"; and "Transcendental Theory of Experience."  

But these four parts don’t mean the book was very detailed yet. The first three parts all talked about the same thing: Kant’s theory of space and time, which he had already explained before. The fourth part added three main ideas about experience, like substance, cause and effect, and interaction.

Even though the first three parts all have "dialectic" in their titles, Kant only clearly talks about arguments and counter-arguments in the fourth part. He also hints at some disagreements about space and time in the earlier parts.

At this time, Kant was still figuring out how to organize his work. But what he wanted to include was pretty clear. First, about space and time, he said that "All space and times are parts of larger ones," and that "All parts of space and time are themselves spaces and times." This means space and time don’t have simple parts, they are continuous, and they go on forever but are still one whole thing. No matter how big a space or time is, it’s always part of something bigger. Kant also said that to understand this, we have to assume that space and time "are nothing real."

In the "Dialectic of Understanding - Transcendental Theory of Magnitude," he said that even though space and time can be divided forever, "Infinite space and infinite past time are incomprehensible." This shows there is a conflict between how we sense space and time and how we understand them with our minds. But Kant didn’t say how to fix this problem, only that "Space and time belong only to the appearances and therefore to the world and not beyond the world."

Then Kant talked about the "Transcendental Theory of Experience." Here, he made three main points. First, substance, meaning matter, can’t come from nothing or disappear into nothing. Matter is eternal (always existing), but it depends on other things.  

Second, every condition in the world has a cause, because everything is connected.
