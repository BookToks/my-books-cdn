This is the question we will focus on for now, but only for a little while. Reason wants rules and principles to help our understanding connect everything clearly, just like understanding uses concepts to organize what we see and experience.

But this principle doesn’t tell us any laws about objects themselves. It doesn’t explain how we can know or define things in general. Instead, it’s just a helpful rule for our understanding to keep things simple by using the fewest concepts possible. It doesn’t mean we can expect things in the world to always match these ideas perfectly. So, the big question is: Does pure reason by itself have basic rules and principles that are true before we experience anything? And if yes, what are those rules like?

The way reason works in logic, like in syllogisms (a kind of logical argument), already shows us where its basic principle comes from when it thinks about knowledge without experience.

First, syllogisms don’t work with what we see or feel directly, but with ideas and statements. So, if pure reason thinks about objects, it doesn’t connect with them right away or with our direct experiences. Instead, it works with understanding and the judgments it makes based on what we sense, to figure out what objects are. The unity of reason is not the same as the unity of experience, which comes from understanding. For example, the idea that everything has a cause is not something reason alone knows or sets as a rule.

This idea that everything has a cause only makes experience possible and doesn’t come from reason alone, because reason can’t create this kind of connection without relying on possible experience.

Second, when used logically, reason looks for the universal condition or the most basic rule behind its ideas.
