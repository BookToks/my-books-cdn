If you always stay careful and think carefully before trying to prove something, you can save yourself a lot of hard work that won’t get you anywhere. Before starting, ask yourself how you could expect to find answers using just pure reason, and where these answers might even come from. Don’t expect reason to do more than it can handle. Instead, keep your reason in check, even when it really wants to explore big ideas.

The first rule is this: don’t try to prove things about big ideas without first figuring out where your principles come from and why you think they will work. For example, if your principles come from how we understand things like cause and effect, then you can’t use them to prove ideas that go beyond what we can experience. If you try to use pure reason alone to prove these big ideas, you’ll just waste your time. Reason does have its own principles, but they mostly help us organize what we learn from experience. If someone shows you proofs that seem to go beyond this, use your judgment to question them. Even if you don’t fully see why they’re wrong, you have the right to ask for clear explanations of the principles they use. If these principles are supposed to come from pure reason, you won’t get a good answer. So, you don’t have to waste time arguing with every false idea. Instead, you can reject all of them at once by using critical thinking that demands real rules.

The second thing to know about these big proofs is that for each one, there’s usually only one good way to prove it. When you try to make a point based on what you can directly see or experience—like in math or science—you have lots of information to work with. This lets you connect ideas in many ways and find different paths to the same conclusion because you can start from different places.
