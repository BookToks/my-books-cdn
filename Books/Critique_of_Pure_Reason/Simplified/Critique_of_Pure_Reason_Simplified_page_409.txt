I won’t get into a deep study here to figure out exactly what the great philosopher meant by his words. I just want to point out that when we look at what an author says about a topic—whether in normal talking or writing—it’s pretty common that we understand them even better than they understood themselves. This happens because they might not have fully figured out their idea and sometimes said or thought things they didn’t mean.

Plato noticed that our ability to know things wants more than just putting together appearances to make sense of what we experience. Our reason naturally reaches for ideas that go beyond anything we can actually experience, but these ideas are still real and not just made-up thoughts.

Plato found these big ideas mostly in practical things—meaning things based on freedom, which come from reason. If someone tries to get ideas about virtue just from experience, or uses imperfect examples as the perfect model, they would make virtue unclear, changeable, and useless as a rule. Instead, we all know that when someone is called a model of virtue, we actually compare them to the real idea of virtue in our minds. This idea is what we use to judge if they are really virtuous. Real-life examples only show that this idea is possible to some extent, but they’re never the perfect example. Just because no person will ever fully live up to the pure idea of virtue doesn’t mean the idea isn’t real.

It’s only by having this idea that we can judge what is morally good or bad. So, it’s the foundation for trying to be morally perfect, even though human nature might make it hard for us to reach that goal.

Plato also applied his ideas to pure thinking and math, even though math only deals with what could possibly happen in experience. I don’t agree with everything he said about this, especially the mysterious way he explained these ideas or how he treated them as if they were independent things. But the grand way he talked about them can be understood in a softer way that fits better with how things really are.
