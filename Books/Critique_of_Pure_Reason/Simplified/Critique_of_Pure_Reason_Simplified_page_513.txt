Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter II talks about how we understand nature. It says that nature includes everything we can see and measure with our senses and math (called the extended). But there are also things we can’t show or imagine directly (called the simple). It also says that we shouldn’t believe there’s a special power like freedom that works outside natural laws. Our understanding should only look for causes and rules inside nature because nature is all we know and it gives us everything we learn about.

If a scientist only wants to stop people from being too curious or acting like they know more than they do, that’s okay. Sometimes people try to turn practical ideas into big theories without enough proof. They might start with real science but then jump to ideas that don’t really add new knowledge, just confusion. If the scientist just wants to remind us to be humble and only trust what experience shows us, that helps a lot. It means we can still believe in things that matter to us personally, but we shouldn’t call those beliefs real science. True knowledge only comes from what we can experience, and if we try to go beyond that, it’s just guessing without proof.

But if someone who believes only in experience becomes too sure and says nothing can exist beyond what we can sense, that’s a problem too. That’s being just as arrogant as the people they criticize. It actually hurts important practical ideas that reason helps us with.
