When I talk about analyzing concepts, I don’t mean just breaking down what those concepts are or what they include, like philosophers usually do. Instead, I mean looking at how our understanding works itself. The goal is to figure out how we can have certain concepts before any experience, by studying how our mind uses understanding in a pure way. This is what transcendental philosophy is all about. The rest is just the logical study of concepts.

In Kant’s notes, he says that experience is made up of statements that add new information. How these statements are possible is not just a question—it’s a fact.

But now we need to ask, how is this fact possible?

Experience is made of judgments, but we have to wonder if these judgments depend on some basic, pure judgments that come before experience. When we analyze experience, we look at the judgments in it, and also at concepts that are both learned from experience and known before experience.

The main problem is: How can experience happen? First, what does our understanding do when we make judgments? Second, what do our senses do in judgments based on experience? Third, when we use our understanding with what our senses show us, how do we get knowledge about objects?

At first, it’s clear that experience can only happen because of certain judgments that add new information and are known before experience. These basic principles are part of how we use our mind. We also need to ask if they go beyond just our mind.

To check if something is truly experience or a fact, we test if it fits under general rules that apply to all similar judgments. If it doesn’t fit any general rule or concept, then it’s a mistake or a false belief—like in superstition or blind faith.
