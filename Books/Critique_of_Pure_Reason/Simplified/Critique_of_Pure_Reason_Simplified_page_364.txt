The idea of splitting the world into two parts—a world we can sense and a world we can only understand—is not allowed. Even though we can divide ideas into those we can sense and those we only understand, we can’t say the second kind is real because we can’t find any object for them. If we ignore our senses, how can we explain that our categories (which are the only concepts we have left for things we can’t sense) still mean anything? To connect these ideas to any object, we need more than just thinking; we need some kind of possible way to sense or imagine them.  

Still, the idea of a "noumenon" (a thing as it is in itself, not just how it appears to us) is useful, but only as a way to show the limits of what we can sense. It’s not a special object we understand directly. Instead, it’s a problem: can we know something not by sensing it but by understanding it in a completely different way that we can’t even imagine? This idea expands our understanding negatively—it’s not limited by what we can sense, but it sets limits on what our senses can do by naming things beyond appearances as noumena. But since we can’t know these things through categories, we only think of them as some unknown "something."  

However, I’ve noticed that some modern writers use the terms "world of sense" and "world of understanding" in a totally different way than the old philosophers did. This isn’t a problem by itself, but it often just becomes a confusing way of using words without meaning much. For example, some say that all the things we see make up the "world of sense," while the connections between these things, when we think about them using general rules, make up the "world of understanding."  

In this way, simple astronomy that just looks at the stars is part of the world of sense. But deeper astronomy, like explaining the universe using ideas from Copernicus or Newton, belongs to the world of understanding because it makes sense of the universe in a way we can imagine. But this change in meaning is just a trick to avoid a tough question by making it sound ordinary. When it comes to appearances, both understanding and reason can be used. But we have to ask if they still work when the object isn’t just an appearance (a noumenon), especially if we think of the object as only something we understand, not something we can sense.
