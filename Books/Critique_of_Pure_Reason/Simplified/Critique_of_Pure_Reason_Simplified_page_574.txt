Section III talks about proving that there is a highest being, something perfect and complete. Every other idea we have is incomplete and depends on something else. But just because something isn’t perfect, it doesn’t mean it definitely depends on something else. Still, only something perfect and complete can be truly independent.

Among all ideas of things that could exist, the idea of a being with the highest reality fits best with the idea of a necessary being — one that must exist. Even if this idea isn’t perfect, we don’t have a better option. We can’t just ignore the possibility that a necessary being exists. So, if we accept this, nothing else in the world of possibilities can claim to be more deserving of existing.

This is how human reason usually works. First, it convinces itself that some necessary being exists.

Then it looks for something that exists without depending on anything else. It finds this in the being that causes everything else to exist — the one that has all reality. The all-encompassing being is a single, absolute unity, which means there is one highest being. So, reason concludes that this highest being exists absolutely and necessarily.

It makes sense to accept this idea if we already agree that some necessary being exists and we have to decide where to put it. There’s no better choice than to say this being is the complete, original source of everything.

But if we don’t feel forced to decide yet, and just want to think about what we really know or don’t know, the argument isn’t as strong. It needs extra support to fix its weak points.

For now, we can say two things: first, from any existence (even just our own), we can argue that an unconditionally necessary being exists; second, …
