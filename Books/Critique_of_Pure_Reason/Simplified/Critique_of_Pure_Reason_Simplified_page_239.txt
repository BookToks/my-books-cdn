Pc II. Div. L Bk. I. Ch. II kept saying that it’s impossible to understand things beyond what we can experience using these ideas and rules. But the way they tried to explain it using experience doesn’t match with how we actually know things in math and science without needing experience first. So, their idea is proven wrong.

The first thinker got really excited because once reason has power, it won’t stop itself just because someone says to be careful. The second thinker became very doubtful because he thought reason tricks us and makes us believe things that aren’t true. Now, we’re going to try to find a way to guide human reason between these two extremes, set clear limits for it, and still allow it to work fully and purposefully.

Before we do that, I’ll explain what categories are.

Categories are general ideas about an object that help us understand it in a specific way when we make judgments. For example, a categorical judgment connects a subject to a predicate, like “All bodies are divisible.” But just using logic alone doesn’t tell us which part is the subject and which is the predicate. For example, you could also say, “Something divisible is a body.” But when we use the category of substance, if we think about a body, we know its experience always has to be the subject, not just the predicate. The same goes for all other categories.

It’s totally impossible for a concept to be made completely before experience and still relate to a real object. What comes next is the version of the "Transcendental Deduction" from the first edition. It was split into two parts there but combined differently in the second edition.
