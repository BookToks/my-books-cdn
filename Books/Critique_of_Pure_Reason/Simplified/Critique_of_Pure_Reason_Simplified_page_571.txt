If we take this idea seriously and treat it as real, then we can figure out what the original being is just by thinking about the highest reality. This being would be one-of-a-kind, simple, enough on its own, eternal, and so on. In other words, we can understand it completely without any conditions by using all its qualities. This idea of such a being is what we call God in a very general, universal way. So, pure reason aims to understand God in this broad sense, which is what transcendental theology tries to do, like I explained earlier.

But using this idea like that actually goes beyond what it’s supposed to do and what’s allowed. Reason uses this idea to understand all reality in general, but it doesn’t mean this reality has to actually exist as a real thing. Thinking of it as a specific, real being is just a made-up idea that helps us manage all the different parts of our thought. We have no proof or good reason to assume such a being really exists, and none of the ideas that come from this assumption affect how we understand things in general, which is the only reason we needed this idea in the first place.

It’s not enough just to talk about how our reason works and its arguments; we also need to find out where this illusion comes from to explain why we think this way. The idea of the highest being isn’t random; it comes from something natural. So, the question is: why does reason think that all possibilities come from one single possibility, the highest reality, and even assume those possibilities are part of one original being?

The answer comes from earlier discussions in Transcendental Analytic. Objects we sense are related to our thoughts. We can think about their form before we experience them, but the actual stuff we sense—the reality in what appears to us—has to be given from outside. Without that, we can’t think about anything or imagine any possibility. An object we sense can be fully described only if we compare it with all its qualities and say if they are there or not. But since the real part of the object has to be given for us to think about it at all, and the real part in all appearances is given in one all-encompassing thing...
