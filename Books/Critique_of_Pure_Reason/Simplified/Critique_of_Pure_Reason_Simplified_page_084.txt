To explain the changes Kant made in detail would be too much for this introduction, but a few things can be pointed out. First, even though Kant tried some experiments without using the idea of apperception in 1783 and 1786, he actually focused more on the idea of the unity of apperception as the starting point than he did in 1781. At the same time, he tried to link this unity more clearly to the idea that judgments have objective truth, better than before. 

Second, Kant wanted to get ready for his new "Refutation of Idealism" by saying that the thinking subject shapes how it understands itself just as much as how it understands the outside world. Finally, continuing his focus on the importance of space, which was part of his answer to the charge that he was like Berkeley’s idealism, Kant said that the unity of consciousness is responsible for the unity of both space and time. He also said that understanding specific spatial relationships is necessary to understand the order of time, which is an obvious part of any self-awareness.

The main idea of all the changes in the "Analytic of Principles" is that while time is the form of all sense, the idea of space is needed to understand the order of time. This continues Kant’s answer to the charge of Berkeley-like idealism. These changes include restating the principles of judgment and adding paragraphs at the start of each proof. But the most important new part is the "Refutation of Idealism," added during the discussion of what is real in the "Postulates of Empirical Thought."

This might seem like a strange place to add it, but Kant wanted to show that meaningful judgments about what is possible or necessary depend on connecting to what is actually perceived. He wanted to explain what "actual" means in perception: it’s what we judge to exist on its own, even though the way we represent this independence depends on how we experience things. In other words, the "Refutation of Idealism" is Kant’s strongest effort to prove that his idealism is only formal (about how we think), not like Berkeley’s subjective realism that says nothing exists outside our mind.
