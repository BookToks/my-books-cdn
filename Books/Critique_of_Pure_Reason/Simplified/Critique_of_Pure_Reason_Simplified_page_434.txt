About the mistakes made by pure reason: these things are never things we can see or touch outside of us. But the same “Something” that makes outer things appear and affects our senses—helping us understand space, matter, shape, and so on—can also be the subject of our thoughts. Even though we don’t get direct feelings or images of thoughts like we do with things outside us, we only get ideas of space and its parts.

This “Something” isn’t big or solid or made of parts because those ideas only apply to things we sense outside of us. These words don’t tell us what this “Something” really is, only that it can’t be described the same way as things we see. But thinking and having ideas inside us doesn’t go against this.

So, even though the human soul is simple, it’s not very different from matter if we think of matter just as how it appears to us. 

If matter were a real thing by itself, it would be very different from the soul, which is simple. But matter is just how things look to us on the outside, and we don’t really know what it is deep down. So, I can guess that underneath it all, matter is simple too, even if it looks big and made of parts to us. And I can also guess that this simple thing, which seems like a body to us, can also think and be aware through its inner sense.

That means the same thing that looks like a body from the outside could also be a thinking being inside. We wouldn’t see its thoughts directly, only signs of them in what appears outside. So, instead of saying only souls think, we could say humans think—that is, the same being that looks like a body on the outside is simple inside and can think.

But even without these guesses, if I say a “soul” is a thinking being by itself, it doesn’t make sense to ask if it’s the same kind as matter. Matter isn’t a thing by itself at all; it’s just how our mind shows it to us. So, a thing itself is naturally different from just the ways it appears to us.
