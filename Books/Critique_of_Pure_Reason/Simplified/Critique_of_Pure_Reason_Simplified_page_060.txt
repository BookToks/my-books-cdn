If changes are real, then time must be real too, even if we don’t fully understand what time is. But if time isn’t real, then no change can be real either. I think even someone who believes everything is just ideas must admit that changes really happen in their thoughts, like when something starts and ends.

So, time can’t be just fake or imaginary.

Sulzer wrote a short letter that also talks about time. He said that the length of time must be real, even if the idea of time is just something we get from our experience. Mendelssohn also said he couldn’t believe time is only in our heads. He said that one event happening after another is something our minds need to understand things. And if changes happen in our minds, why wouldn’t they happen in the real world too? 

Kant didn’t answer this right away. In a letter to Herz on June 7, 1771, he said their letters made him start a long investigation. He told Herz he was busy writing a book called “The Bounds of Sensibility and Reason,” which would explain how our senses and reason work and what ideas about taste, metaphysics, and morality should include. He also said he hoped to finish planning the book soon.

Kant didn’t write to Herz again until February 21, 1772, when he sent a famous letter. In it, he explained that his book would have two parts: one about theory and one about practice. The theory part would have two sections — one about how we experience things and one about metaphysics (the study of what exists). The practical part would cover feelings, taste, desires, and morality.

But while thinking about the theory part, Kant realized he was missing something very important. This missing piece was the key to understanding metaphysics better, something he and others had overlooked before. However, this problem was not about the question others had raised about his ideas on time. Even though Kant would later accept that objection, it didn’t make him change his mind about time being ideal or not real in the usual way.
