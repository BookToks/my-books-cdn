In solving the problem above, we also find a way to use pure reason to support and carry out all sciences that involve knowing things before experience, like math and natural science.

We can ask: How is pure math possible? How is pure natural science possible?

Since these sciences actually exist, it makes sense to ask how they can be possible. Their existence proves that they must be possible. But metaphysics hasn’t made much progress yet, and no one can say for sure that real metaphysics even exists, so people often doubt if it’s possible at all.

Still, this kind of knowledge can also be seen as something we naturally have. Metaphysics might not be a formal science yet, but it exists as a natural tendency in humans. Human reason, without just wanting to know everything for show, naturally pushes us to ask questions that experience alone can’t answer. So, some form of metaphysics has been part of all humans once they start thinking deeply, and it will always be there.

Now, we can ask: How is metaphysics as a natural tendency possible? In other words, why does pure reason naturally ask these questions?

Because all past attempts to answer these natural questions have led to contradictions—like whether the world had a beginning or has always existed—we can’t just rely on this natural tendency or reason alone. We need a way to be sure if we really can know or not know these things.

(Some people might still doubt this about pure natural science. But if you think about the basic ideas in physics—like matter staying the same, inertia, and cause and effect—you’ll see that pure physics is a real science on its own and should be clearly established as one.)
