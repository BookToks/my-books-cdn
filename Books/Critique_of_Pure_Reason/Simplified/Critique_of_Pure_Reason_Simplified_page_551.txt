The law of nature says that everything that happens has a cause. This means that every action happens before its result, and nothing can happen without a cause. So, everything that happens is connected in a natural order. This law helps us understand the world and makes sure that everything we experience follows rules. We can't ignore this law or say that something happens without a cause because then it wouldn't be part of what we can experience. It would just be a made-up idea.

Even though it seems like there is a never-ending chain of causes, this doesn’t stop us. We have already thought about what happens when we try to find the cause of everything all the way back. If we believe that everything is exactly as it seems without questioning, then there would be no nature or freedom. The real question is: if everything that happens is caused by nature, can we also say that some things happen because of freedom? Or do these two ideas contradict each other?

In the world of appearances, nothing can start a chain of events by itself. Every action is also an event that depends on something else happening first. So, everything that happens is part of a chain, and nothing happens out of nowhere. All natural causes are effects of earlier causes, and this goes on in time. We shouldn’t expect a first action that just starts everything without a cause.

But if effects are just appearances, does that mean the causes must also be only things we can observe? Is it possible that even though every effect needs a cause we can see and study, this cause might also come from something beyond just what we observe?
