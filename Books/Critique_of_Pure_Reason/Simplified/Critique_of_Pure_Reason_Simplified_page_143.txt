When we make a judgment, like saying something about a subject, there are two ways the subject and the predicate (the thing said about the subject) can be connected.

Either the predicate is already included in the idea of the subject, even if we don’t realize it at first; or the predicate is completely outside the subject’s idea but still connected to it in some way.  

If the predicate is part of the subject’s idea, the judgment is called analytic. If the predicate is not part of the subject’s idea, the judgment is called synthetic.  

Analytic judgments just explain what’s already in the subject’s idea by breaking it down into parts. Synthetic judgments add new information to the subject’s idea that wasn’t there before.  

For example, if I say “All bodies are extended,” this is an analytic judgment because the idea of “body” already includes “extension.” I just have to think about the idea carefully to see it.  

But if I say “All bodies are heavy,” this is a synthetic judgment because “heavy” is not part of the basic idea of a body. It adds something new.  

So, analytic judgments don’t really increase what we know; they just help us understand the idea better. Synthetic judgments, on the other hand, add new knowledge that wasn’t in the original idea.
