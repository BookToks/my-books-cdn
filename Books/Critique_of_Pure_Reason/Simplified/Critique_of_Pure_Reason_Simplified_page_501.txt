We are talking about a true beginning, not in terms of time but in terms of cause and effect. For example, if I am completely free right now and decide to get up from my chair without being caused to do so by anything natural, then this action starts a brand new chain of events. Even though this happens after other events in time, it is not caused by them. This decision and action are not just a part of natural causes following each other. Instead, the natural causes stop being the reason for this event. It happens after the previous events but does not come from them. So, in terms of cause and effect, this is a completely new beginning.

The need to believe in a first cause that starts everything freely can be seen clearly when we look at ancient philosophers. Except for the Epicureans, most of them thought there had to be a "first mover" to explain why things move in the world. This first mover was a cause acting freely and starting everything from itself. They did not think it made sense to explain the first beginning just by natural causes alone.
