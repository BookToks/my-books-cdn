I can’t think of myself as separate because all my thoughts and feelings come from one single part of my mind. I only say “I” when I connect all my experiences in my mind. There has to be a basic rule that makes it possible and necessary for all my experiences to be connected in a certain way, like a law that applies to everything I see or feel. I call this basic rule the “affinity” of all appearances, meaning how they naturally fit together.

But we can’t find this rule anywhere except in the idea that all my thoughts belong to one single “I.” According to this idea, everything I experience has to fit together in a way that makes sense to me. This only works because my mind connects everything in a way that’s necessary and real.

All my experiences come from one shared consciousness, which is the reason I can even have experiences at all. The way everything fits together in my mind is a result of how my imagination works, following certain rules even before I experience anything.

My imagination is special because it can put things together even before I actually see or feel them. This is why I call it the “productive imagination.” Its job is to make sure all the different things I experience connect in one clear way. It might sound weird, but this is how my imagination makes sense of everything I see and feel and helps me have real experiences. Without this, I wouldn’t be able to understand anything as real.

The “I” inside me is what links all my thoughts together so I can be aware of them. All my awareness is connected to this “I,” just like all my feelings about time come from my inner sense of time. This “I” has to work with my imagination to make my thoughts more than just random images. Even though my imagination works before I experience things, it still deals with how things look or feel, like the shape of a triangle.

All the different parts of my experience are related to the unity of this “I,” which keeps everything connected.
