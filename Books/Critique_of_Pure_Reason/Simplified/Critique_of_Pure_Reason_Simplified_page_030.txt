For the third and fourth antinomies, which Kant calls "dynamical" because they deal with what causes the world and its events, he has a different answer. He says that both sides can be right if we limit the denial of free causes or necessary beings to the natural, sensible world. At the same time, the idea that these things exist can refer to a world beyond what we can sense, called the noumenal or supersensible world. Kant’s ideas about these antinomies helped shape his whole "Transcendental Dialectic," and his solution to the third antinomy is important for his moral philosophy and how he connects theory with morality.

Kant talks about the "Ideal of Pure Reason" in the last part of the "Transcendental Dialectic." Rational theology, the last of the so-called metaphysical pseudo-sciences, is discussed here. An "idea" is a pure concept created by reason, and an "ideal" is the idea of a single thing that perfectly shows a pure idea. For example, we don’t usually think of the soul as an ideal because we believe there are many souls. But in the Judeo-Christian tradition, the idea of God is seen as one perfect thing, so the idea of God is the ideal of pure reason.

Kant says the idea of God is unavoidable as the "ens realissimum," which means the highest individual being with all perfections, and it supports all the possibilities of other things. He uses thoughts he had almost twenty years before writing the Critique, in a work called The Only Possible Ground of Proof of the Existence of God (1763). But now, Kant harshly criticizes his earlier attempt to prove God’s existence as this perfect being, as well as other traditional proofs of God, which he had already criticized in his first writings.

Kant groups the traditional proofs of God’s existence into three types, without explaining why there are only these three. The first is the ontological proof, based only on the idea of God. The second is the cosmological proof, based on the fact that the world exists. The third is the physico-theological proof, based on the design and order we see in the world. The first proof is the one St. Anselm and Descartes supported. The second is an argument from dependent things needing a necessary cause, supported by Wolff and his followers. The third is the design argument popular during the early Enlightenment, especially in Britain. David Hume had already criticized this argument strongly in his book Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, but Kant hadn’t seen this work yet because it wasn’t translated into German when he wrote the Critique.
