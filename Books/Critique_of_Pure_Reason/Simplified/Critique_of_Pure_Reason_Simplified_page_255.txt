We have talked about understanding in different ways—like how it works naturally with thoughts, or how it helps us think and make judgments. But all these ways really mean the same thing. Now, we can say that understanding is like a skill for making rules. This idea helps us understand it better.

Our senses give us shapes and images, but understanding gives us rules. It’s always trying to find rules in what we see and experience. When these rules are about real things and always true, we call them laws.

We learn many laws from experience, but these are just specific parts of bigger laws. The biggest laws don’t come from experience. Instead, they come from understanding itself, before we even have any experience. These laws make it possible for us to have experiences in the first place. So, understanding doesn’t just make rules by looking at what happens; it actually creates the basic laws of nature. Without understanding, there wouldn’t be any nature at all.

The way we keep all our experiences connected and make sense of many different things as one is called the “unity of apperception.” This unity is why all the rules and laws in our experiences have to be true and fit together. The understanding is the part of us that makes sure all these rules work together.

All possible experiences are built on this understanding first, and they get their shape from our senses. So, even though it sounds strange, it’s true that understanding is where the laws of nature come from. But, the specific laws we learn from experience don’t come from understanding alone, and the huge variety of things we see can’t be explained just by how we sense them.

In short, all the specific laws we find in nature are just parts of bigger, pure laws that come from understanding itself.
