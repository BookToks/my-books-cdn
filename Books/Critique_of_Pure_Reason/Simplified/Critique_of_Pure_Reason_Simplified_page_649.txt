First, philosophy tries to figure out if something exists by itself or depends on other things. It also looks at whether something’s existence is possible, real, or necessary. This kind of thinking uses ideas and is called philosophical.

Math, on the other hand, deals with things we can picture in our minds before we experience them, like shapes in space or how time passes. It helps us understand numbers and measurements by building ideas step by step. This is called mathematical reasoning.

Because math works so well, people naturally hope that its methods can also work outside of numbers and measurements. Math can create clear ideas that help us understand nature. But pure philosophy struggles because it uses ideas without being able to picture them clearly, so it can’t always prove if they’re real.

Experts in math are usually confident, and most people expect great things from them. But many don’t think much about how math and philosophy are different. They use rules they learned from everyday thinking as if they were always true. They don’t really ask where ideas about space and time come from or how reliable they are. Instead, they just use these ideas.

This works fine as long as they stick to studying nature. But when they try to go beyond what we can sense and into pure ideas, they lose their footing. It’s like trying to stand on land that doesn’t exist or swim in water you can’t feel. They can only take a few shaky steps there, which don’t last. In contrast, math is like a strong, clear path that can be followed confidently for a long time.

Because of this, it’s important to understand that using math’s methods in philosophy doesn’t help. Instead, it just shows how limited those methods are when dealing with pure ideas. Math and philosophy are very different, even though they work together in science. The way math works can never be copied by philosophy.
