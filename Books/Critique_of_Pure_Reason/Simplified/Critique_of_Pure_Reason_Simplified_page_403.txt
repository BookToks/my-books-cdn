A "syllogism" is a kind of reasoning where you start with one statement and get other related statements from it. For example, if you say "All humans are mortal," that also means "Some humans are mortal," "Some mortal beings are humans," and "No immortal being is a human." These ideas come directly from the first statement. But if you say "All scholars are mortal," that doesn’t come straight from the first idea because "scholar" isn’t mentioned there. You need another step to connect them.

When I use a syllogism, I first think of a general rule (called the major). Then, I think about a specific case that fits that rule (the minor). Finally, I figure out what I can conclude based on that rule and case (the conclusion). This process uses reason before experience. The way the rule relates to what I know creates different types of syllogisms: categorical, hypothetical, or disjunctive. Usually, when I want to check if a conclusion is true, I look to see if it fits under a universal rule. If it does, then the conclusion is valid for other cases too.

So, reason tries to take lots of different ideas and explain them with just a few simple rules. This helps make all those ideas fit together in one clear system.

Now, about pure reason: can we think of reason on its own, as a real source of new ideas and judgments that come just from reason and relate to things? Or is reason just a tool that organizes ideas we already have? It helps us arrange what we know in a logical way, putting smaller rules under bigger ones by comparing them. But is that all reason does?
