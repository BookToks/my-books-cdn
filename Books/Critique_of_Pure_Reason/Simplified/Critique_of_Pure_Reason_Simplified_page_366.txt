The idea of pure, sense-free judgment means thinking about things without using our senses. But this kind of thinking doesn’t really work because we can’t imagine how these pure ideas could actually exist or be given to us.

When we try to think about these pure ideas, it’s like leaving an empty space. This empty space only limits what we can know from real, sensory experiences but doesn’t help us understand anything new beyond that.

Kant even explains this more by saying that the positive concept, or the possible knowledge, has to come from something we can actually experience.

In his book, Kant talks about how objects must be given to us through our senses, not just by imagination or thought alone.

Now, we have studied the pure understanding carefully and looked at every part of it.

We have also figured out where everything fits in this system of understanding.
