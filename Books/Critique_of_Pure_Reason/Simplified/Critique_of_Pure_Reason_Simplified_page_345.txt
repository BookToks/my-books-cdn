Some people wonder if what can possibly happen goes beyond what we can actually experience. I only brought up these questions to cover everything that most people think is part of how we understand things. But really, the idea of absolute possibility (which means something can happen in every way) isn’t just a simple idea we understand from experience. It belongs to reason, which goes beyond what we can learn from experience. So, for now, I just made a quick note about this and left it unclear, planning to talk more about it later.

Now, as I finish this fourth part, and with it the whole system of basic rules about pure understanding, I have to explain why I called these rules “postulates.” I’m not using the word the way math uses it, or how some recent philosophers have used it to mean something that’s accepted without any proof. If we said some ideas could be true just because they claim to be, without any evidence, then there would be no way to check if they’re right or wrong. Our understanding would believe everything, even things that don’t make sense, just because they sound confident. So, when we add something to the idea of a thing before any experience, we must always give a reason or explanation for why that idea is allowed.

These rules about possibility, reality, and necessity don’t actually add new facts about the thing itself, so they’re not objective-synthetic. But they are still synthetic in a way related to our mind, because they add the power to understand where the idea comes from. If the idea connects only to the formal conditions of experience, then the thing is called possible. If it connects with...
