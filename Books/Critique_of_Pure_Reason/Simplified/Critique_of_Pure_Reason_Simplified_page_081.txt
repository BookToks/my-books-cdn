Finally, Kant said his ideas were different from Berkeley’s because Berkeley thought we learn about space and time only through experience, which can change. But Kant believed we already know about space and time before any experience, as basic and necessary ways we understand the world.

Kant wanted to show that only his way of thinking, called transcendental idealism, could explain how we know math and pure science without experience. He also wanted to prove that his ideas fit with the fact that real things outside of us do exist. When he updated his book, the Critique, he aimed to fix these points. He also wanted to explain that using pure reason just for theory is wrong and that we should use it practically instead. This last idea was criticized but not answered before.

Kant was also worried about how well he explained some parts of his ideas, especially the “transcendental deduction of the categories” and some mistakes in pure reason. He said he was happy with the overall work but not with how these parts were shown. So, he rewrote those chapters in the second edition of his book to answer critics and his own doubts.

Kant showed his worry about this deduction even in an earlier work called the Prolegomena. He used a method there that looked at what we already know for sure, instead of starting from deep ideas about how we think like in the Critique. The main difference between the two works is what kind of knowledge they analyze. In the Prolegomena, Kant stopped using the idea of “apperception” (self-awareness) and instead focused on what makes judgments true for everyone in everyday life and science.
