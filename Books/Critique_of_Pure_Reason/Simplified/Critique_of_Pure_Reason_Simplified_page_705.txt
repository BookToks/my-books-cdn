Chapter 3 talks about how reason works in two ways. One way is based on goals we come up with by chance, which gives us practical knowledge that fits together. The other way comes from an idea that reason creates first, without waiting for experience, which builds a complete and organized system.

What we call science is based on this second way. It starts with an idea that lays out the whole plan before anything else. Science can’t just come from random facts or experiences used for different purposes. Instead, it comes from a big, clear goal that connects everything together. This kind of science is different from others because it is organized around one main idea.

No one tries to create a science without starting from an idea. But when scientists begin their work, their first plans or definitions often don’t fully match the original idea. The idea is like a seed inside reason that is hard to see clearly at first. Because of this, sciences should be explained based on the idea inside reason that connects all their parts, not just based on what the first scientist said. Founders and even later experts often don’t fully understand the idea, so they can’t clearly explain what their science is really about or how it fits together.

It’s a bit frustrating that we only get a clear view of the big idea and can organize everything properly after collecting a lot of random facts and working with them in a practical way. At first, systems of knowledge form kind of by accident, like maggots growing from a mix of ideas. These systems might seem messy at first but become complete over time. Even though they start this way, each system actually grows from a seed idea inside reason and fits together with other systems to form a complete structure of human knowledge. Now that we have so much information collected, it wouldn’t just be possible but fairly easy to build a well-organized system of all human knowledge.
