This critique of pure speculative reason tries to change how metaphysics is usually done. It wants to make a big change, like what happened in geometry and natural science. It’s not about teaching metaphysics itself, but about explaining the method to study it. It also gives an overview of metaphysics, showing its limits and how it is organized inside.

Pure speculative reason is special because it can and should check its own abilities. It does this by looking at different ways to choose what to think about and by listing all the ways to ask questions. This helps create a complete outline of metaphysics. When it comes to knowledge that comes before experience, nothing can be said about objects except what the thinker puts into them. Also, pure speculative reason has its own set of principles that work together like parts of a body. Every part depends on the others, and you can’t trust one part unless you see how it fits with the whole system.

Just like how the main laws about how planets move explained what Copernicus guessed at first, this critique suggests a new way of thinking as a guess too. Copernicus’s idea was strange because it went against what people saw, but it turned out to be true. It looked for the cause of the planets’ movements not in the planets themselves but in how we observe them. 

In this book, the new way of thinking is first shown as a guess to get us thinking. But later, it will be proven for sure based on how we understand space, time, and basic ideas of the mind.
