* Now the concern of this critique of pure speculative reason consists in that attempt to transform the accepted procedure of metaphysics, un­ dertaking an entire revolution according to the example of the geome­ ters and natural scientists. It is a treatise on the method, not a system of the science itself; but it catalogs the entire outline of the science of metaphysics, both in respect of its boundaries and in respect of its entire internal structure. For pure speculative reason has this peculiarity BXXlll about it, that it can and should measure its own capacity a according to the different ways for choosing the objectsb of its thinking, and also completely enumerate the manifold ways of putting problemscbefore itself, so as to catalog the entire preliminary sketch of a whole system of metaphysics; because, regarding the first point, in a priori cognition nothing can be ascribed to the objectsd except what the thinking subject takes out of itself, and regarding the second, pure speculative reason is, in respect of principlese of cognition, a unity entirely separate and subsisting for itself, in which, as in an organized body, every part exists for the sake of all the others as all the others exist for its sake, and no principle! can be taken with certainty in one relation unless it has at the * In the same way, the central laws of the motion of the heavenly bodies estab- BXXll lished with certainty what Copernicus assumed at the beginning only as a hy­ pothesis, and at the same time they proved the invisible force (of Newtonian attraction) that binds the universel which would have remained forever undiscovered if Copernicus had not ventured, in a manner contradictory to the senses yet true, to seek for the observed movements not in the objects of the heavens but in their observer. In this Preface I propose the transformation in our way of thinking presented in criticismh merely as a hypothesis, analogous to that other hypothesis, only in order draw our notice to the to first attempts at such a transformation, which are always hypothetical, even though in the treatise itself it will be proved not hypothetically but rather apodictically from the constitution of our representations of space and time and from the elementary concepts of the understanding.
