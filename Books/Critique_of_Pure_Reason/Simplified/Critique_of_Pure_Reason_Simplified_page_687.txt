Chapter 2, Section 1

We might be able to understand the spiritual part of the soul and maybe even its immortality, but we can’t rely on that to explain what we see in life or what the future after death will be like. That’s because our idea of something without a body is just a negative idea—it doesn’t really give us any real knowledge or facts, only guesses that philosophy can’t approve.

Even if we proved there is a highest intelligence, like a god, that would help us understand the general order and purpose in the world. But it wouldn’t let us decide exactly how everything is arranged or assume things that we don’t actually see. It’s important in thinking to not ignore natural causes or jump to conclusions based on things we can’t know or experience.

In short, these three big ideas about the soul, god, and the afterlife are always beyond what our reason can fully understand. They don’t help us understand the world we experience, and trying to figure them out with pure thought alone is a tough but basically useless effort.

If these three ideas aren’t necessary for knowledge but our reason keeps pushing us to think about them, then their real importance must be practical.

Anything practical is related to what we can do freely. But if our free choices depend on experience, then reason can only guide us by organizing what we learn from experience. For example, reason helps us bring together our desires and goals into the idea of happiness and figure out how to reach it. This means reason can only give practical advice for acting based on what we sense, not absolute rules from pure thought.

Pure practical laws, on the other hand, come from reason alone and don’t depend on experience. These laws apply absolutely and are moral laws. So, only moral laws belong to the true practical use of reason and can be used as a standard.

So, all the work of pure philosophy is really focused on those three big questions: what to do if we have free will, if God exists, and if there is a future life.
