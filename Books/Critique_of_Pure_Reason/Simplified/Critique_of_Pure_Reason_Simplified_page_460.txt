People often think that the way we explain thinking is about the true nature of things, but that’s not quite right.

It would cause a big problem for our ideas if we could prove, without any experience, that all thinking beings are simple substances. This would mean that personality is always part of them, and they are aware of themselves as separate from the physical world.

If that were true, we would be moving beyond what we can sense and enter a world of things as they are in themselves. Then, no one could stop us from exploring and claiming that world as our own.

The statement "Every thinking being is a simple substance" is something we can’t know just by thinking; it goes beyond what we experience and adds something new that we can’t see or test.

This means such ideas wouldn’t just apply to things we can experience, but to things in general, which would ruin the whole purpose of our careful study and make us go back to old ways of thinking.

But this problem isn’t as big if we look more closely at what’s really going on.

Rational psychology makes a mistake through a faulty argument, which goes like this: If something can only be thought of as a subject, then it must exist only as a subject and must be a substance.

A thinking being, when we consider it only as a thinking thing, can’t be thought of any other way than as a subject.

So, it must exist only as a subject, meaning it is a substance.

The first part talks about a being that can be thought of in every way, even as something we can imagine or experience.

But the second part only talks about the being as a thinking subject, focusing on its consciousness, not on how it appears to us as something we can sense.

Because of this, the conclusion doesn’t really follow correctly.
