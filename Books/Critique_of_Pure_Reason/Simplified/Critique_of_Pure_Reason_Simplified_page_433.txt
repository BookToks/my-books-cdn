Part II, Division Book II

I understand the idea that my mind is simple, but I don’t really know what that means about me. Saying “I am substance” is just a basic idea that doesn’t help me understand myself in real life. Saying “I am a simple substance” means that my mind isn’t made of many parts mixed together. But this idea doesn’t actually teach me anything about myself as a real thing I can experience, because the idea of “substance” is just a way of organizing thoughts, not about a real object. It only applies to how we think, not to any specific thing we can point to. Let’s try an experiment to see if this idea is useful.

Everyone agrees that saying the soul is simple is important only because it helps us see the soul as different from matter, which can break down or die. This idea is mainly used to say the soul is not physical. If I can prove that even if we accept the idea that everything that thinks is a simple substance, it doesn’t actually help us understand how the soul is different from or connected to matter, then this idea is just a thought without any real meaning or use.

We have already shown that bodies are just appearances we sense from the outside, not things as they truly are. So, we can say that our thinking self is not physical. This means that since we know our mind from inside, it can’t be something we see or touch outside in space. Thinking beings can never show up as outer objects, and we can’t see their thoughts, feelings, or desires from the outside. These things belong only to the inner experience. This idea seems natural and is the common way people have thought about souls as completely different from bodies.

But even though things like size, hardness, parts, and movement—everything we sense outside—are not thoughts, feelings, or choices, they cannot contain those inner experiences.
