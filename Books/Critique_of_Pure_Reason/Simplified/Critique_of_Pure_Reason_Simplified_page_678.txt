So actually, it doesn’t really contain any opinions at all. The ideas we’re talking about are just guesses that can’t be proven wrong, but they also can’t be proven right either. They aren’t just personal opinions, but even though some people don’t like them, we can’t just ignore them (even if we want to feel calm inside). But we have to remember to keep these ideas only as guesses and not believe they are absolutely true. We also have to make sure they don’t confuse us or trick us.

**First Chapter, Fourth Section: The rules for pure reason when it comes to proofs.**

Proofs about special kinds of knowledge are different from other proofs because reason can’t just look at the object using its ideas. Instead, it first has to prove that these ideas are valid and that they can be combined in a way that makes sense before experience. This isn’t just being careful; it’s necessary for the proofs to work at all. I can’t think about an object without some special hint that comes from outside the idea itself. In math, this hint is a kind of clear mental picture, and from that, all conclusions can be made easily.

When we think about knowledge that deals with concepts, we can use experience as a guide. The proof doesn’t show that one idea (like something happening) automatically leads to another idea (like a cause), because that would be a jump with no reason. Instead, it shows that experience itself wouldn’t be possible without this connection. So, the proof has to show that it’s possible to understand something new about things even before experience, based on how ideas fit together. If we don’t pay attention to this, the proofs can go off track, like water flooding a field wherever it wants. Just feeling convinced because of personal connections between ideas isn’t enough to make us sure. That’s why all attempts to prove certain principles have failed.
