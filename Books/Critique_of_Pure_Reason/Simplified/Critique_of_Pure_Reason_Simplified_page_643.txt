Chapter 1, Section 1 talks about how pure reason works in a special way that’s different from other kinds of thinking. Without clear rules, people might make mistakes by trying to use methods that work in some areas but not here.

Mathematics is a great example of pure reason working well without needing experience. When something works well once, we naturally hope it will work well in other cases too. So, people want to use the same method in philosophy that works in math, hoping it will give the same kind of certainty. That’s why it’s important to know if the way math proves things is the same as how philosophy tries to do it, which is called dogmatic.

Philosophy uses reason based on ideas, while math uses reason based on building ideas step by step. To build an idea in math, you have to show a kind of mental picture that doesn’t come from experience. This picture is of one specific thing but also represents the whole group of things that fit the idea. For example, when you draw a triangle, you show one shape in your mind or on paper without copying it from real life. This drawing is just one example, but it still explains the idea of a triangle for all triangles, because you ignore details like the length of the sides or angles that don’t change what a triangle is.

So, philosophy looks at the general idea by thinking about many examples, but math looks at the general idea in one example, using reason alone. Even though this one example is specific, it still stands for the whole group because it follows certain rules that apply to all cases.
