If something happens, it usually follows something else that caused it. This connection between what comes first (the cause) and what happens after (the effect) is what helps us understand the world and experience things in a real way.

But there is an important point to remember. Sometimes, causes and effects happen at the same time, not one after the other. For example, a room feels warm because of a heated stove inside it. The stove’s heat and the warmth in the room happen together, even though one causes the other.

Most causes in nature happen at the same time as their effects. The order in time matters, but not how much time passes. When an effect first appears, it always happens at the same moment as its cause is active. If the cause stopped even a moment before, the effect wouldn’t happen.

Think about a ball resting on a soft pillow. The ball causes a dent in the pillow at the very same time it’s sitting there. But we still know the ball came first because if the pillow had a dent already, the ball wouldn’t have made it.

So, the order of events in time is the main way we tell what effect comes from which cause, even if they happen at the same time.
