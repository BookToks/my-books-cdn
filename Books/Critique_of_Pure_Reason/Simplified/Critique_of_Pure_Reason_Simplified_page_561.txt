Part of the world we experience is made up of appearances, which are just how things seem to us through our senses. These appearances depend on conditions we can sense, but they aren’t the true things themselves.

Here, the goal isn’t to prove that there must be some being that exists no matter what, or to explain how a being we can’t sense might make things possible. Instead, we keep reasoning limited to what we can experience and don’t jump to ideas beyond that, which we can’t actually show or prove.

At the same time, we don’t say that things we can’t sense are impossible. It’s shown that everything we experience in nature could be random and dependent on other things, but there could still be a necessary being that we can’t sense. These ideas don’t contradict each other, so both can be true.

This necessary being might be impossible to fully understand, but that doesn’t mean it can’t exist just because everything we experience depends on something else. We shouldn’t stop trying to explain things by only looking at what we can sense, but also understand that reason works differently when we think about things beyond our senses.

The world we know through our senses is only made of appearances, which depend on our experience. Since we never deal with things as they are in themselves, it doesn’t make sense to jump from one appearance to something outside our experience as if it were a real thing existing on its own.

Things we see might seem random, but that randomness is only how they appear to us. Trying to find a cause outside what we can sense only leads to more appearances and causes we can also sense.

Thinking about a cause beyond appearances, something that isn’t random like what we see, doesn’t go against the endless chain of causes we experience or the random nature of appearances. Both ideas can exist together.
