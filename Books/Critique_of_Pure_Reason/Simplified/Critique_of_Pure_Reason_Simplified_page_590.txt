It’s impossible to prove that everything we see in the universe is connected just by looking at the universe itself. When we think about matter—the stuff that makes up everything real—each part of it comes from something else, like a cause and effect. Because of this, matter can’t be the one necessary thing that causes everything else, since its properties depend on other things and could, in theory, disappear. If all matter disappeared, we’d have reached the ultimate unity of everything by experience, but that’s not allowed by certain rules of reasoning.

So, matter and everything in the world can’t be the necessary original being that explains everything. Instead, this necessary being must exist outside the world. That way, we can always try to explain the world’s appearances as coming from other causes, even if we don’t prove this necessary being exists. But we act as if it does, always aiming to fully understand the world based on that idea.

The idea of the highest being is really just a guiding rule for our thinking. It helps us imagine that everything in the world comes from one all-powerful cause, which makes the world follow universal laws and be connected in a system. But this idea doesn’t prove that such a being actually exists.

At the same time, it’s easy to trick ourselves into thinking this idea is real and that the highest being actually exists. Just like we naturally think of space as something real and absolute because it makes everything else possible, we tend to think of this highest being as a real, necessary object. Because it seems to be the ultimate cause, we imagine it must exist for everything else to be connected and make sense.
