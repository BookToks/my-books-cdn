74 In the "Critique of Judgment," Kant adds the power of judgment, which has two types: determinant and reflective. This is another key mental ability; see "Critique of Judgment," Introduction, IV; 5:179.

75 See "Critique of Pure Reason," A633-7/B661-5. It’s important to know that Kant’s first big paper was a big step in his moral philosophy. It suggested that perfect moral behavior comes from pure thinking. See Manfred Kuehn’s article about Kant’s moral ideas in his dissertation. But Kant hadn’t yet fully realized that using reason practically is the only true way to use pure reason.
