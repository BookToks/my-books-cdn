The idea of the noumenon is not something clear or definite. It doesn’t mean knowing any specific thing, but just thinking about something in a very general way, without any details we get from our senses.

To really understand a noumenon as a true object, different from things we see or sense, it’s not enough to just stop using our senses. We also need a good reason to believe there is another kind of way to experience or understand it. Otherwise, our thoughts about it don’t really mean anything, even if they don’t contradict themselves.

We proved earlier that the only way we can experience things is through our senses, but we didn’t prove that there couldn’t be another way. So, even if we think beyond our senses, we don’t know if that’s just a mental idea or if there’s actually something real behind it.

When we think about appearances in general, we are thinking about something totally unknown, which we call the “transcendental object.” But this isn’t the noumenon because we don’t actually know what it really is. We only know it as the object that appears to our senses, and this is the same for all appearances.

We can’t apply our usual ways of understanding (called categories) to this unknown object because those categories only work with things we experience through our senses. Using the categories without any sensory input doesn’t give us real knowledge; it just helps us organize our thoughts, but doesn’t prove the object actually exists.

If we take away all the thinking tools that come from experience, then we don’t have a way to truly know or understand this kind of object.
