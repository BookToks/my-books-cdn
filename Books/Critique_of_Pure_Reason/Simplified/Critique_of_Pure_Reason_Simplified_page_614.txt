All ideas in deep religious thinking are connected, like parts of a whole, but each idea is seen as complete on its own.

Reason starts with what we understand from experience and tries to find a unity or connection between these ideas, even beyond what we can actually experience.

The connection between different things doesn’t just apply to the things themselves but also to their qualities and powers. For example, when we observe the planets moving in circles, we notice some changes. We then guess that their orbits might not be perfect circles but can change in many small ways following certain rules. This is how we come up with the idea of elliptical orbits.

Comets move in even more different paths, and they don’t come back in circles like planets do. Still, we think their paths might be parabolas because those are similar to ellipses. If the ellipse is very stretched out, it looks almost like a parabola in our observations.

Using these ideas, we find a common pattern in the paths of planets and comets, and then we look for one cause behind all their movements—gravity. From there, we try to explain all the differences and odd movements based on the same idea.

Sometimes, we even imagine things that experience can’t prove, like comets moving in hyperbolic paths that take them out of our solar system, traveling between stars and connecting distant parts of the universe with one force.

What’s interesting about these ideas is that they seem to go beyond what we can fully know. They are like goals that reason tries to reach but can only get closer to, never fully grasp.
