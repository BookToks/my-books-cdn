3) There is a great and wise cause (or maybe several) behind the world. This cause isn’t just a powerful force working randomly, but an intelligent being acting freely.  

4) We can guess that this cause is one because the parts of the world fit together like pieces of a smart design, something we can be sure of when we observe closely. Beyond what we see, it’s likely true based on similarities we notice.  

We shouldn’t argue too much about the idea that nature works like human-made things (like houses or clocks), even if nature doesn’t follow our plans exactly. When we think about this, it makes sense to believe there’s some kind of understanding and will behind nature, like a superhuman artist. This idea might not hold up under the strictest deep thinking, but if we want to name a cause, comparing it to things we know well, like human art, is the safest bet.  

Reason can’t just jump from a cause we understand to some unknown and unprovable explanation.  

Based on this, the way nature looks so well planned might only prove that the form or design is accidental, not the actual stuff the world is made of. To prove that the world’s materials themselves come from a highest wisdom would need a different kind of proof, not just comparing it to human art. So, any proof can at most show a greatest architect working with materials that already fit well, not a creator who controls everything from the start. This isn’t enough to prove the idea of an all-powerful original being. If we wanted to prove that the material itself is not necessary, we’d need a deep, complex argument, which we are trying to avoid here.  

So, this reasoning moves from the clear order and purpose we see...
