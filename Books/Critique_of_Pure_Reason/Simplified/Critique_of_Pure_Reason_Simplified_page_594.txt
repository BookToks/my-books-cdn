Impossibility of physico-theologial proof order grounded on ideas. 3) Thus there exists a sublime and wise cause (or several), which must be the cause of the world not merely as an all­ powerful nature working blindly through fecundity, but as an intelli­ gence, through freedom. 4) The unity of this cause may be inferred from the unity of the reciprocal relation of the parts of the world as members of an artful structure, inferred with certainty wherever our A6261 B 654 observation reaches, but beyond that with probability in accordance with all principles of analogy.
 
 Without quibbling with natural reason about the inference it draws from the analogy between natural products and those of human art, when it does violence to nature and constrains it not to proceed in ac­ cordance with its own ends but to bend to ours (the similarity of na­ ture's ends to houses, ships, and clocks), just such a causality, namely understanding and will, is made a ground, when it derives the inner possibility of freely working nature (which makes all art, and perhaps even reason itself, possible) from another though superhuman art, which sort of inference perhaps might not stand up to the sharpest tran­ scendental critique -one must nevertheless admit that once we are sup­ posed to name a cause, we could not proceed more securely than by analogy with such purposive productions,a which are the only ones where we are fully acquainted with the causes and the way they act.
 
 Reason would not be able to justifyb to itself an attempt to pass over from a causality with which it is acquainted to obscure and unprovable grounds of explanation, with which it is not acquainted.
 
 According to this inference, the purposiveness and well-adaptedness of so many natural arrangements would have to prove merely the contingency of the form, but not of the matter, i.e., of substance, in the A62 7 I B 655 world; for the latter would further require that it be able to be proved that the things of the world would in themselves be unsuited for such an order and harmony according to universal laws if they were not in their substance the product of a highest wisdom; but entirely different grounds of proof from those provided by the analogy with human art would be required for this. Thus the proof could at most establish a highest architect of the world, who would always be limited by the suitability of the material on which he works, but not a creator of the world, to whose idea everything is subject, which is far from sufficient for the great aim that one has in view, namely that of proving an a11sufficient original being. If we wanted to prove the contingency of matter itself, then we would have to take refuge in a transcendental argument, which, however, is exactly what was supposed to be avoided here.
