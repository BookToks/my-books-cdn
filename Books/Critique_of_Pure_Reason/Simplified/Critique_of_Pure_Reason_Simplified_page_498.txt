Imagine if there was a kind of freedom that works completely on its own, like a special power that could start things happening without anything causing it first. This freedom would be able to begin a chain of events all by itself. But if that’s true, then the choice to start those events would also have to happen without anything before it making it happen. 

However, every time something starts, it needs a cause that wasn’t active before. For a totally new action to begin, it can’t be connected to what happened before in any way. So, this kind of freedom goes against the idea that everything happens because of cause and effect. It would mean there’s no way to have a clear experience or understanding of how things connect, which makes it just an idea with no real proof.

So, all we have is nature, where everything happens according to rules that connect events in the world. Being free from these natural rules might sound like true freedom, but it also means there’s no order or guidance. You can’t say that new rules of freedom replace natural laws, because if freedom followed any rules, it wouldn’t be true freedom—it would just be another part of nature.

In short, nature follows laws, and this special kind of freedom means no laws at all. They are totally different, like order versus chaos.
