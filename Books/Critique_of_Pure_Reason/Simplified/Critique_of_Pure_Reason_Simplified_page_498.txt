Proof Suppose there were a freedom in the transcendental sense, as a special kind of causality in accordance with which the occurrences of the world could follow, namely a faculty of absolutely beginning a state, and hence also a series of its consequences; then not only will a series begin ab­ solutely through this spontaneity, but the detem1ination of this spon­ taneity itself to produce the series, i.e., its causality, will begin absolutely, so that nothing precedes it through which this occurring action is deter­ mined in accordance with constant laws. Every beginning of action, how­ ever, presupposes a state of the not yet acting cause, and a dynamically first beginning of action presupposes a state that has no causal connec­ tion at all with the cause of the previous one, i.e., in no way follows from it. Thus transcendental freedom is contrary to the causal law, and is a combination between the successive states of effective causes in accor- A447/B475 dance with which no unity of experience is possible, which thus cannot be encountered in any experience, and hence is an empty thought-entity.
 
 Thus we have nothing but nature in which we must seek the con­ nection and order of occurrences in the world. Freedom (indepen­ dence) from the laws of nature is indeed a liberation from coercion, but also from the guidancea of all rules. For one cannot say that in place of the laws of nature, laws of freedom enter into the course of the world, because if freedom were determined according to laws, it would not be freedom, but nothing other than nature.b Thus nature and tran­ scendental freedom are as different as lawfulness and lawlessness; the Leitfoden a b In the first edition: " ...i t would be not freedom, but nature." 485 Doctrine of Elements.
