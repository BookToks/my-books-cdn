On Time <B> our principle of the ideality of all of our sensible intuitions; rather, if one ascribes objective reality to those forms of representation then one cannot avoid thereby transforming everything into mere illusion.
 
 For if one regards space and time as properties that, as far as their pos­ sibility is concerned, must be encountered in things in themselves, and reflects on the absurdities in which one then becomes entangled, be­ cause two infinite things that are neither substances nor anything really inhering in substances must nevertheless be something existing, indeed the necessary condition of the existence of all things, which also remain B 71 even if all existing things are removed; then one cannot well blame the good Berkeley if he demotes bodies to mere illusion;38 indeed even our own existence, which would be made dependent in such a way on the self-subsisting reality of a non-entity such as time, would be trans­ formed along with this into mere illusion; an absurdity of which no one has yet allowed himself to be guilty.
 
 Iv. In natural theology, where one conceives of an object that is not only not an object of intuition for us but cannot even be an object of sensible intuition for itself, one is careful to remove the conditions of time and space from all of its intuition (for all of its cognition must be intuition and not thinking, which is always proof of limitations). But with what right can one do this if one has antecedently made both of these into forms of things in themselves, and indeed ones that, as a pri­ ori conditions of the existence of things, would remain even if one re­ moved the things themselves? -for as conditions of all existence in general they would also have to be conditions of the existence of God.
 
 If one will not make them into objective forms of all things, then no al- B 72 ternative remains but to make them into subjective forms of our kind of outer as well as inner intuition, which is called sensible because it is not original, i.e., one through which the existence of the objectb of intuition is itself given (and that, so far as we can have insight, can only pertain to the original being); rather it is dependent on the existence of the object,c thus it is possible only insofar as the representational capacity of the subject is affected through that.39 · ) It is also not necessary for us to limit the kind of intuition in space" and time to the sensibility of human beings; it may well be that all finite thinking beings must necessarily agree with human beings in this re­ gard (though we cannot decide this), yet even given such universal va­ lidity this kind of intuition would not cease to be sensibility, for the ve,ry reason that it is derived (intuitus derivativus),d not original (intuitius or a Princip b Objects , Objects d derivative intuition 191 Doctrine of Elements.
