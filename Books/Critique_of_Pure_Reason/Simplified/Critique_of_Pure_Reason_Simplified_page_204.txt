On Time is not about believing that everything we sense is real in itself. If you think the ways we understand things like space and time are actually real by themselves, then you end up turning everything into just an illusion.

If you imagine space and time as things that exist on their own, you get stuck in some weird problems. Like, how can two infinite things that aren’t real objects still exist and be necessary for everything else to exist? Even if all things disappeared, space and time would still have to exist. Because of this, it’s easy to see why Berkeley said that physical things are just illusions. If time, which isn’t really a thing, has to be real for us to exist, then our own existence would also just be an illusion. That’s a crazy idea that no one really accepts.

In natural theology, when people think about God, who can’t be understood through our senses, they make sure not to apply time and space to God’s existence. This is because all knowledge comes through senses, which have limits. But if you already think time and space exist on their own and are needed for anything to exist, then why would you leave them out when thinking about God? After all, if they are conditions for all existence, they have to apply to God too.

If you don’t think time and space are real things on their own, then the only choice is to see them as ways our mind understands the world, kind of like tools our brain uses to make sense of things we see and feel. This way of understanding is called "sensibility" because it depends on our senses. It’s not that the things exist because of time and space, but that our minds organize experiences using these ideas. Also, it’s possible that all creatures who can think have to understand the world this way, not just humans. Even if that’s true, this way of understanding would still be based on our senses and not something original or absolute.
