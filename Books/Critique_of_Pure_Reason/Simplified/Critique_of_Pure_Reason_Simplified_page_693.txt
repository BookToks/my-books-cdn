Morality is about doing what’s right, and hoping to be happy is connected to always trying to be worthy of that happiness. We can’t understand this just by looking at nature alone. Instead, we have to believe in a higher reason—something like a smart, moral force that controls nature and follows moral laws.

I call the idea of this smart force, which combines perfect goodness and the greatest happiness, the highest good. This highest good is the perfect example where happiness matches being morally good. Only by thinking about this highest good can we understand why being good and being happy are connected.

We have to think of ourselves as part of a moral world, even if our senses only show us the physical world. Since the physical world doesn’t always link being good to being happy, we have to believe the moral world is something that will happen in the future. So, believing in God and an afterlife comes from the rules that pure reason gives us.

Morality is like a system that works by itself, but happiness isn’t a system unless it’s shared based on how moral people are. This can only happen in the moral world, which is controlled by a wise creator. Reason forces us to believe in this world and life after death, or else moral laws would just be useless ideas. Because moral laws have to come with rewards and punishments, they must be based on something real and necessary.

These laws couldn’t work without a highest being, the highest good, who makes sure everything fits together on purpose.

Leibniz called the world where moral beings live under the highest good the “realm of grace.” He said this is different from the “realm of nature,” where people only get results based on natural events, not moral worth. So, thinking of ourselves as living in the realm of grace—where happiness is waiting for us if we’re worthy—is an idea that reason tells us we need to accept.
