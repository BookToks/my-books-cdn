You can tell how confusing these ideas are because we can't even clearly explain just one of them. We try to understand what they mean, but we quickly have to think about how we sense things and how things appear to us. Without this, the ideas lose their meaning, and we can’t really understand what they’re about.

For example, no one can explain what “magnitude” really means except by saying something like: it’s how we figure out how many units are in something. This idea depends on repeating things one after another, which is connected to time.

When we think about “reality,” it only makes sense if we imagine time as either full of something or empty. If we ignore the idea that something exists all the time, then the idea of “substance” becomes just a logical idea—a subject that exists by itself, not describing anything else.

But here’s the problem: we don’t know any real conditions that would let us say this subject actually exists. So, this idea doesn’t really tell us anything useful or lead to any conclusions. It doesn’t help us understand anything about real objects or things.

The idea of “cause” as a pure concept is also tricky. If we ignore time, we only know that a cause lets us guess that something else exists. But without time, we can’t even tell the difference between cause and effect. Plus, to make this guess, we need other conditions that we don’t understand. So, the concept of cause doesn’t really help us identify anything.

People say “everything that could happen has a cause” like it’s super important. But if you ask what “could happen” means, and the answer is “something that might not exist,” then how do you know what it means for something to possibly not exist if you don’t have a clear idea of that?
