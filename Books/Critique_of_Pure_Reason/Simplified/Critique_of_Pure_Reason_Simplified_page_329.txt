Every time we notice something happening after something else, we are basically thinking about time. When we realize one thing comes after another, we understand time as a kind of measurement that goes from nothing up to a certain amount. Because of this, we can understand the rules about how things change over time even before we see them happen.

Time is like the background that makes it possible for one thing to come after another. Our mind, by being able to connect all our experiences into one, helps us figure out where everything fits in time. This happens because causes always lead to effects, which makes it possible to understand how things happen in order and makes our knowledge about time reliable.

Now, about things happening at the same time: If two things happen simultaneously, they affect each other. For example, if you can look at the moon and then the Earth, or the Earth and then the moon, and both ways work, it means they exist at the same time. This is what we mean by simultaneity—the presence of different things at the exact same moment. But we can’t actually see time itself; we only see things happening in time.
