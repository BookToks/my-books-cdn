I don’t know of any studies more important for understanding what we call the mind and how it works than the ones I did in the second chapter of the Transcendental Analytic, called the Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding. These studies were the hardest for me, but I hope they were worth it. This deep investigation has two parts.

One part is about the things the mind understands and tries to prove why its ideas are valid before we experience anything. This is the main goal of my work. The other part is about the mind itself—how it’s possible and how it thinks. This looks at the mind in a personal way and is important, but it’s not the main focus. The main question is always: “What and how much can the mind know without any experience?” not “How is thinking itself possible?”

The second question is more like guessing the cause of something, so it feels like I’m sharing my opinion here, and readers could disagree. But even if my personal explanation doesn’t fully convince, the main proof I give about understanding will still be very strong, as I explain on pages 92-93.

Finally, about being clear, readers have the right to expect first clear ideas through logical thinking, and then clear examples or pictures to help understand. I worked hard to make the ideas clear.

That was very important for my project, but it also meant I couldn’t fully meet the second need for clear examples, which is less strict but still fair. While working, I often wondered how to handle this. Examples seemed necessary and were in my first draft. But then I saw how big my task was and how many things I had to cover. I realized just explaining everything in a dry, academic way would already fill a big book. So, I decided not to add more examples, which are mostly needed for popular books. This work isn’t meant for casual readers, and real experts don’t need things to be too simple. Though it would be nice, adding examples here might have made things worse.
