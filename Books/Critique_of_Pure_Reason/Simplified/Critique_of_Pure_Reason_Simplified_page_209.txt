Part II. Transcendental Logic is about the way our thoughts connect to each other — basically, the general way we think. Since there are pure (basic, without experience) and empirical (based on experience) ways we understand things, we can also find a difference between pure thinking and thinking about real-world objects.

This means there is a kind of logic that doesn’t ignore what we know, but focuses only on pure thinking about objects. This kind of logic leaves out anything based on experience. It looks at where our knowledge of objects comes from, especially when it’s not from the objects themselves. General logic, on the other hand, doesn’t care about where knowledge comes from but only about how we organize ideas in our minds, whether those ideas come from experience or not. It deals only with the way our understanding works, no matter where the ideas started.

Here’s an important point to remember for what comes next: not all knowledge we have before experience (a priori) is “transcendental.” Only the knowledge that helps us understand how and why some ideas or concepts can be used before any experience counts as transcendental. For example, space or its geometric rules are not transcendental by themselves. But knowing that these ideas don’t come from experience and can still apply to things we experience is what makes something transcendental.

Also, using the idea of space for all objects is transcendental. But if we only think of space in terms of what we sense, then it’s called empirical. The difference between transcendental and empirical is about how we judge knowledge, not about how it relates to the object itself.

We might guess that there are ideas that relate to objects before experience, not as direct senses or images, but as pure thinking. These ideas come from neither experience nor the senses. So, we imagine a science that studies pure understanding and pure reasoning — thinking about objects completely before experience. This science would explain where this kind of knowledge comes from, what it covers, and how it’s valid. We call this transcendental logic because it focuses only on the rules of understanding and reasoning when they connect to objects before experience, unlike general logic that includes both kinds of knowledge without making a difference.
