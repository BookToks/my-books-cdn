Logical reflection is basically just comparing things by ignoring where they come from in our mind. It treats all ideas the same way, no matter what kind of thinking power they come from. But transcendental reflection is different because it looks at the actual objects themselves. It helps us understand how we can compare these objects in a real way. This kind of reflection is something everyone has to do if they want to judge things before experiencing them.

Now, let's look at identity and difference. If we see the same object many times and it always has the same qualities and amounts, it is considered exactly the same object by pure understanding—just one thing, not many. But if we are talking about appearances, the situation changes. Even if two things look the same in every way, if they are in different places at the same time, they are actually different objects.

For example, two drops of water can be exactly the same in quality and size, but because they are in different spots, they are counted as two different drops. Leibniz thought appearances were things themselves and called them phenomena, so his rule that identical things can’t be different made sense in his view. But since appearances belong to our senses and our understanding of them is based on experience, space itself already gives us the idea of many things being different.

Even if one part of space is exactly like another, it is still separate and outside of the other. This means that anything existing in different places at the same time is different, no matter how similar they are.
