Part II, Division I, Book I, Chapter II talks about the basic idea of how our mind combines everything we sense into one clear picture. This happens because our understanding works together with space and time, which are the ways we naturally experience things.

General logic is made based on how our mindâ€™s higher abilities work and is organized in a way that matches these mental parts.
