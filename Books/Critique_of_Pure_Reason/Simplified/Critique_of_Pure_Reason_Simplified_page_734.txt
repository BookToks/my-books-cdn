There are many thoughts about the idea in this paragraph. You can find them in different writings by Kant from 1769 to 1797. Kant got interested in this topic again because of a contest by the Royal Academy of Sciences. The contest wanted people to argue against Kant’s idea and say that all knowledge comes from experience.

Kant called this kind of correctness “hypothetical correctness” in one of his works from 1776-78.

If you want to see other versions of Kant’s explanation of time, check his dissertation and some writings from 1774 to 1777.

Some objections were made by important philosophers of Kant’s time, like Johann Heinrich Lambert, Moses Mendelssohn, and Johann Georg Sulzer. Lambert said that even if time is needed for us to understand things, that doesn’t mean time isn’t real. He argued that if changes are real, then time must be real too.

Mendelssohn said he couldn’t believe time is just something in our minds. He thought that because things happen one after another, and spirits (like people or even God) experience this order, time must be real.

Sulzer had a slightly different opinion. He believed that duration (how long things last) and extension (space) are simple ideas that are real, but time and space are made up of these ideas. So, time and space might be partly in our minds but still based on real experiences.

Sulzer’s view is a bit like Locke’s idea that time is a complex idea formed from our experience of how long things last.
