The way we understand things we see depends on how our mind is set up before we even experience them. This is clear because if things didn’t match how our mind works, we wouldn’t be able to understand them at all. But it’s harder to see that these things also have to fit with how our mind needs to connect ideas to make sense of them.

Things we see could be all mixed up, so our mind wouldn’t be able to link them together properly. For example, if events didn’t follow any pattern, we wouldn’t be able to understand cause and effect, and that idea would become meaningless. Still, we would see things because just looking doesn’t require thinking.

Some might say that because we see things happen in a certain order all the time, we can just learn cause and effect from experience. But this isn’t true. The idea of cause has to come from how our mind works, or it’s just a made-up idea. Cause means that one thing (A) always makes another thing (B) happen, following a rule that never changes.

We might see that something usually happens after something else, but we never see a rule that says it has to happen. Cause and effect means the effect doesn’t just come after the cause by chance; it happens because of the cause. This kind of strict rule can’t come from experience alone because experience only shows us patterns that usually work, not ones that always work without exception.

If we thought ideas like cause and effect came only from experience, we would be changing how we understand these important ideas completely.
