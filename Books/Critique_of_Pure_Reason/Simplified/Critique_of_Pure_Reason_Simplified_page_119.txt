If a science gets stuck right before it finishes, or if it has to keep going back and trying new ways to reach its goal, or if the people working on it can’t agree on how to proceed, then we can be sure that this study is still just guessing around. It hasn’t yet found a clear, reliable path like a real science. It helps our thinking a lot if we can find that clear path, even if we have to accept that much of what was thought before was useless.

Logic has followed this sure path since the time of Aristotle. It hasn’t had to go backward, except for dropping some small details or making its explanations clearer. These changes make it nicer to understand but don’t change its reliability.

What’s also interesting about logic is that it hasn’t really made any big steps forward either. It seems finished and complete. Some modern thinkers have tried to add parts about how our mind works, where knowledge comes from, or about our biases. But these ideas don’t actually improve logic; they mix it up with other subjects. Logic is its own science, focused only on the basic rules of thinking—rules that apply no matter what kind of thinking it is or what problems our minds might have.
