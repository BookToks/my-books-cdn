Sometimes people think more or less about certain features of things. For example, when thinking about gold, one person might focus on its weight, color, and softness, and also know that it doesn’t rust. Another person might not know that last part. People only use some features when those are enough to tell things apart. But as we learn more, some features might be added or removed, so the idea of gold is never completely fixed.

Also, what’s the point of trying to fully define a concept like this? When talking about water, for example, people don’t stop at just the word “water” and its few features. Instead, they run experiments to learn more. So the word “water” is just a name, not a full explanation. A definition is really just deciding what the word means.

Some ideas, like “substance,” “cause,” or “right,” can’t be perfectly defined before experience. I can’t be sure I’ve fully explained a concept unless I know it matches the actual thing. But since many parts of a concept are unclear and we often skip over them, it’s hard to say a definition is completely certain. Instead of calling it a “definition,” it’s better to call it an “explanation,” which can be accepted as mostly true but might not cover everything.

Because of this, neither ideas based on experience nor ideas we have before experience can be perfectly defined. Only ideas we make up by choice can be fully defined. When I create a concept on purpose, I know exactly what I mean because I made it up. But that doesn’t mean the concept matches anything real. For example, if the idea depends on real-world conditions, like a clock, then I don’t know if the concept actually refers to something real. So my explanation is more like describing my plan than defining a real thing.

In the end, only concepts made up by combining ideas in a certain way before experience can be truly defined. This is why only math has real definitions. In math, the objects we think about are shown clearly in our minds ahead of time, and these ideas can’t have more or less than what we imagine.
