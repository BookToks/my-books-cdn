If something exists only because of something else, then every thing you see depends on another thing. That means no single thing is enough to explain everything.

We said that the idea of the world is either too big or too small for what we can actually experience or understand. But why didn’t we say the opposite—that our experience is too small or too big for the idea? Why did we blame the idea for not matching what we can experience?

The reason is that only what we can experience makes our ideas real. Without experience, ideas are just thoughts with no real meaning. So, we use what we can experience to decide if an idea is real or just a guess. When we say one thing is too big or too small compared to another, it's because one is supposed to fit or match the other. For example, if a ball doesn’t fit through a hole, it doesn’t matter if the ball is too big or the hole is too small, because we don’t know which one is supposed to fit the other. But if a man’s clothes don’t fit, we say the clothes are too small, not that the man is too big.

This makes us think that ideas about the world might be based on a wrong idea of how we actually experience things. This doubt can help us see where we’ve been mistaken for a long time.

Kant also noted that some statements about the world’s ideas say too much or too little. For example, people say everything either lasts forever or has a beginning. But Kant said it should be: everything either lasts forever or doesn’t exist in time at all. Also, both ideas can be true: everything in the world depends on something else, but some things outside our world don’t depend on anything.
