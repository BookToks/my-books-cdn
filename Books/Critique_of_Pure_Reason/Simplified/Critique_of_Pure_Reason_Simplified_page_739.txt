Two important writings from this time are Prolegomena to any future Metaphysics (1783), sections 16-22, where the main idea is the difference between simple judgments from what we see and judgments based on experience. Only the experience-based judgments need certain concepts that come before any experience. Another important writing is a long footnote in the introduction to the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786). Here, Kant suggests that the deduction could be based just on the clear definition of what a judgment is in general. It’s interesting that neither of these writings mention the idea of self-awareness or the unity of consciousness in their explanations.

There are other important notes about the deduction, many written between 1783 and 1784. These seem to come after the Prolegomena, which Kant probably finished in summer 1782, so they might be thoughts added later or ideas for the next version of the Critique. Some notes with detailed ideas about the deduction might be from 1780-81 or later, like R 5637, R 5642, and R 5643. Others clearly come from 1783-84, like R 5923, R 5926, R 5927, and R 5930-4.

Although Kant probably only gave a short plan for the deduction here, in a later manuscript he said that the main point is that any combination of things needs an a priori concept. This is almost the whole deduction. These later writings were made after 1793 in a work called What Real Progress Has Metaphysics Made in Germany since the Time of Leibniz and Wolff?

The idea of space and time being one or united doesn’t matter in section 25 but is very important in section 26. So, when Kant mentions section 25 here, he probably means section 26 instead.

A key idea in many of Kant’s notes from 1783-84 is that any combination requires an a priori concept. This is shown in various notes like R 5927, R 5932, and R 5643, which were written between 1780 and 1788. You can also look at Metaphysik Volckmann and later writings like R 6350 from 1797 for more about Kant’s ideas on objects.

In summary, Kant is explaining his thoughts about how judgment and experience work, with many notes and writings exploring these ideas over several years.
