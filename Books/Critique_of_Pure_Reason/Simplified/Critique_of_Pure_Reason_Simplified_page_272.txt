When I think about myself, I can also think of myself as something I’m aware of, like an object. But I only know myself this way through my own feelings and experiences, not exactly as I truly am. This is just as hard as understanding how I can be an object to myself at all, through my own inner senses.

We can explain this better if we think about space as a way we understand things outside of us. Time isn’t something we can see or touch like space, but we imagine time like a line to measure it. Without thinking of time this way, we couldn’t understand how long things last or when things happen.

We always figure out how long time is or when things happen inside us by comparing it to how we see things change outside. So, we organize our inner sense of time just like we organize how we see space outside us. If we agree that we only know outside objects because they affect us, then we have to agree that we only know ourselves inside because we feel changes inside us. This means when we look inside, we see ourselves as appearances, not as we really are.

But when I think about myself in a deeper way, I’m not seeing myself as I appear or as I really am, but simply that I exist. This kind of thinking isn’t about seeing or feeling, it’s just about knowing I am here.

To really understand ourselves, we need both thinking and some kind of inner feeling or intuition that gives us the pieces to put together in our mind. Our own existence depends on this.

I don’t get why some people have trouble with the idea that we can feel ourselves inside. Every time we pay attention, our mind affects our inner feelings. The mind always shapes how we feel inside, fitting what we think with what we experience. Everyone can notice how much their mind changes how they feel inside themselves.
