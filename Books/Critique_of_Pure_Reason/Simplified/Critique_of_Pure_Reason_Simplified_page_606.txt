Criticism of all guesswork about theology focuses on how our understanding connects different ideas, which is the main test for truth. On the other hand, having everything perfectly organized in our minds is just an idea, not something we actually have. This idea helps us find a basic rule to organize all the different ways we understand things, even when we don’t have clear answers, making everything fit together better.

From this, we see that having a system to organize ideas is a rule of logic. It helps when our understanding can’t find clear rules by itself, guiding it with ideas that bring all the rules together under one system. This makes everything connected as much as possible. But it’s uncertain if the way things really are or how our minds work naturally fits into one perfect system. Also, we don’t know if we can assume this system exists before we have any experience. If we could, then all our knowledge, even from experience, would follow the same basic principles and come from one source. That would be a deep rule of reason, making the system not just a helpful method but something absolutely necessary.

We will explain this with an example of how reason works.

One type of connection in understanding is called the cause of a substance, which we call "power." At first, the different ways one thing shows itself seem so different that we might think it has as many powers as effects. For example, the human mind has feelings, awareness, imagination, memory, cleverness, the ability to tell things apart, pleasure, desire, and more. At first, logic tells us to try to reduce this many-sided variety by finding hidden similarities, like checking if imagination with awareness might actually be memory, cleverness, the ability to tell things apart, or even understanding and reason. But the idea of one basic power doesn’t prove if it really exists—it’s just a question to think about.
