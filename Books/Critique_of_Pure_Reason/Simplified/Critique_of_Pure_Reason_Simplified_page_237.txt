There are only two ways that a new idea and the thing it’s about can come together and connect for sure. Either the thing itself makes the idea possible, or the idea itself makes the thing possible.

If the first is true, then this connection only happens from experience, and the idea can’t exist before we experience the thing. This is like how we sense things around us. But if the second is true, then even though the idea doesn’t create the thing, the idea still decides what the thing is before we experience it.

For us to know something as an object, two things need to happen: first, we have to see or sense it, but only as it appears to us; second, we have to have a concept or idea that matches what we sense. We know that the first condition, sensing, is something our mind sets up before we experience anything, because it shapes how things appear to us.

So, all appearances follow this rule because only through it can we sense and experience things. Now, the question is if the ideas we have before experience also come before and make it possible to think about objects at all, even if we don’t see them yet.

Since all experience includes both sensing something and having an idea of that thing, these ideas must be the foundation of all knowledge from experience. This means these ideas (called categories) are necessary and come before experience because without them, we couldn’t think about objects at all.
