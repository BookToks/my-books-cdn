When we look at the world through our senses, everything seems to follow natural laws. Like how one thing causes another, everything happens because of something before it. So, all actions in the world we see have to follow these natural rules and can be explained based on what we experience.

But if we think about things beyond what we can see or sense—something called the “intelligible” part—then it’s different. Even though we can only have a rough idea of it, this part isn’t affected by what we sense or by appearances. Nothing actually happens inside it that needs time to change, and it doesn’t rely on the natural causes we see in the world. This means it can act on its own and be free from the natural laws that control the world of our senses.

You could say this “intelligible” part starts things in the world we see by itself, without being caused by something else in the sensible world. But still, things in the sensible world never just start by themselves—they always come from earlier causes based on experience. So, freedom and natural laws can both exist in the same actions, depending on whether you look at their invisible cause or the visible cause.

To explain this idea about freedom and natural laws, it helps to first understand the big picture of the problem. While philosophy couldn’t prove that something real exists beyond what we sense, practical reason—like our sense of right and wrong—can. This is called morality, and it depends on believing in freedom.

If we didn’t believe that, we’d have to think that nothing exists beyond what we can sense, and that would mean there’s nothing outside of what we experience with our senses.
