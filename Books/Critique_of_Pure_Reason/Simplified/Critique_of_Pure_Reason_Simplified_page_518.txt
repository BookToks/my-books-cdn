When it comes to the big questions about pure reason, cosmological ideas are special because they can assume their object and the way we combine experiences to understand it are already given. The main question is about how this combination can include everything completely, even though this total thing can’t actually be experienced. 

We are only talking about something as it might be experienced, not as it is in itself. So, the answer to these big cosmological questions can’t come from outside the idea itself, because the question isn’t about a real object but about what the idea means. The question asks what the idea includes, which we try to reach through experience, but the answer has to come from the idea alone. This idea is made by reason, so reason can’t ignore it or blame some unknown thing.

It’s not as strange as it sounds that a science can expect clear and certain answers to all its questions, even if we don’t have them yet. Besides transcendental philosophy, there are two pure sciences of reason: one is pure math, which is just about ideas, and the other is pure morals, which is about how we should act. For example, no one doubts that the relationship between a circle’s diameter and its circumference is either rational or irrational. Even if we don’t know exactly which, we can be sure that the answer exists, and Lambert even proved this.

In ethics, everything must be clear because the ideas come straight from reason. But in natural science, there are many guesses where we can never be sure, because nature gives us things without our control or full understanding. The key to these questions is not inside us or our thinking, but outside, so sometimes we just can’t find the right answers. That’s why trying to explain something completely outside what we can experience is pointless and empty.
