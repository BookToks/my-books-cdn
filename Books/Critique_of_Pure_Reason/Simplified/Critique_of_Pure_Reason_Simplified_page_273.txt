Part II, Division I, Book I, Chapter II.

I am not just a simple appearance or an illusion. But how I understand that I exist depends on how I experience things inside my mind. I don’t really know myself as I truly am—I only know how I seem to myself. So, being aware of myself isn’t the same as really knowing myself, even though I can think about myself like I do with other things.

Just like when I know about something outside of me, I need more than just the idea of it—I also need to experience it in some way. The same goes for knowing myself: besides just being aware or thinking about myself, I need to experience the different parts inside me to understand my thoughts. I exist as a mind that can think and put ideas together, but the way I experience these ideas is limited by what I call “inner sense.” This inner sense only lets me understand things in order of time, which is outside of pure thinking. So, I can only know myself as I seem to myself through this experience, not as I would if I could understand myself fully with pure thought.

The phrase “I think” means I am deciding or recognizing that I exist. My existence is already there, but how exactly I understand it—what parts of me I recognize—is not yet clear.

To really understand myself, I need self-experience that is based on something given before any thinking, which is time. Time is something I can sense and is part of how I receive information.

But I don’t have another kind of self-experience that would show me how I act on my own before I even start thinking about it. Just like time gives me what I experience, I can’t fully decide or understand my own existence as something that acts on its own. Instead, I only see my ability to think and decide as something that happens inside me, and my existence is always something I experience through my senses, like an appearance. Still, this ability to act on my thoughts is why I call myself an intelligent being.
