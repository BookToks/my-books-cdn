Part of what we see in the world shows things depend on other things, like a chain of causes and effects. To understand this, we need to think about a cause that matches this chain. This cause must be something clear and definite, like a being that has all power, wisdom, and perfection—something complete and enough by itself.

Words like "very great" or "amazing" power don’t really explain what the cause is. They just show how we compare the size or power of the cause to ourselves. These words don’t tell us what the cause truly is. When we talk about the full greatness or perfection of something, the only clear idea is the whole of reality, everything together.

I don’t expect anyone to fully understand how the size and order of the world relate to all-powerfulness or the unity of the world to its creator.

So, trying to understand the main cause of the world just by looking at nature (physico-theology) can’t give a clear idea. It’s not enough to build a foundation for religion.

Trying to reach the idea of something totally complete is impossible just by observing the world. But in this kind of thinking, people try to make that jump.

After admiring the world’s creator’s power and wisdom but not getting further, the argument suddenly stops using what we see and instead goes back to the idea that the world depends on something else. Then, it uses ideas beyond experience to say that there must be something absolutely necessary. From this necessary thing, it defines a clear idea of a complete reality.

So, the proof that starts by looking at nature ends up turning into a different proof that works only with pure thinking, even though it first said it wouldn’t.
