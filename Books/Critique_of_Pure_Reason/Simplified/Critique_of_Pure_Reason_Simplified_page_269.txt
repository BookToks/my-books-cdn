Part II, Division I, Book I, Chapter II: The idea of a substance means something that can exist on its own, not just as a description of something else. I wouldn’t even know if this idea made sense if I didn’t have real-life examples to apply it to. But I will explain more about this later.

Section BI50 § 24: How we apply ideas to what we sense around us.

Pure ideas from our understanding connect, through just understanding, to things we sense, without deciding if these senses are ours or someone else’s. But by themselves, these ideas are just ways of thinking and don’t yet tell us about any real object. Putting together different parts in our mind relates only to the unity of our self-awareness. This makes it possible for us to know things before experience, based only on understanding, so it’s purely intellectual and beyond experience.

However, because we have a special way of sensing things built into us, which depends on being able to receive impressions (sensibility), our understanding can organize what we sense according to the unity of self-awareness. This means we can think about how all the parts of what we sense fit together, before actually experiencing them. This is the condition that all things we sense as humans must follow. Because of this, the categories — which are just forms of thought — actually apply to things we can sense, but only as appearances. We can only know these appearances before experience.

This process of putting together parts of what we sense, which must happen before experience, can be called figurative synthesis. This is different from just combining ideas in general, which is called intellectual combination. Both are beyond experience because they happen before any actual knowledge.

The figurative synthesis, if it’s only about the original unity of self-awareness (the main connection in our mind), which is thought about in the categories, should be called the transcendental synthesis of imagination. Imagination is the ability to picture something even if we don’t actually sense it at the moment. Since all our sensing is through the senses...
