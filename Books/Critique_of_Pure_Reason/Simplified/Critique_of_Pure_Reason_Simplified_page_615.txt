These principles are like goals we keep trying to reach but never actually do. Even though they are ideas we understand before any experience, they still have a real but uncertain value. They help guide what we might experience and can be useful for exploring it. However, it’s impossible to fully prove these principles in a deep, ultimate way, just like it’s impossible for certain big ideas.

In the Transcendental Analytic, we separated understanding’s principles into two types: dynamical ones, which just help guide our intuition, and mathematical ones, which actually shape our intuition. But even the dynamical laws are important because they make experience possible by giving us concepts we need beforehand. On the other hand, pure reason’s principles can’t shape empirical ideas because they don’t connect to actual sensations, so they don’t have real objects. If we stop using them as shaping principles, how can we still use them to guide us and give them some real meaning?

Understanding creates objects for reason, just like our senses do for understanding. Reason tries to organize all the possible ways understanding can work, just like understanding organizes what we see into concepts and laws. But understanding’s actions, without linking to senses, are unclear. The same goes for reason’s unity—it’s not clear how or how much understanding should group its concepts. Even though we can’t find a direct example in what we sense for reason’s full, organized unity of concepts, we can think of something similar: the idea of having the biggest and most complete way to divide and combine understanding’s knowledge into one rule. We can keep this idea in mind clearly because it leaves out confusing details. So, the idea of reason is like a pattern for our senses, but the way we use concepts with this idea is different.
