Time is a basic idea. You can’t understand it just by thinking about it—it comes from how we actually experience time.

When we say time is infinite, it just means that any specific amount of time needs something to measure it against. So, the original idea of time has to be unlimited. Since we can only understand parts of time by limiting them, we can’t get the whole idea of time just from concepts. Instead, we have to experience it directly.

Here are some important points about time:

a) Time isn’t something that exists on its own or sticks to things as a real feature. If it did, it would exist without anything to connect to. Also, time can’t exist before objects or be a rule that objects follow which we know ahead of time. But if time is just how we experience things inside ourselves, then it can come before any objects in our minds.

b) Time is just the way we sense what’s happening inside us. It’s not about the outside world or shapes and places. Instead, it’s about how our inner experiences happen one after another. Because this inner feeling doesn’t have shape, we imagine time like a line that goes on forever. This line helps us understand time as a series of moments that happen one after the other, unlike points on a line that all exist at once. This shows that time is something we directly feel, like seeing things outside of us.

c) Time is the basic rule for all experiences. Space is the way we understand things outside us, and it has limits. But all our thoughts and feelings happen inside us and follow the rule of time.
