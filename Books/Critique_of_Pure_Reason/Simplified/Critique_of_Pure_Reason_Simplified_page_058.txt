Kant gives examples of the errors that arise from this assumption: It is an error to assume that whatever exists is located in space and timej93 it is an error to assume that "every actual multiplicity can be given numerically," as multiplicities given in space and time are, and thus that "every mag­ nitude is finitej"94 and it is a mistake to assume that what may be an em­ pirical criterion for the application of a concept, as non-existence at some time is a sensible criterion for the modal concept of contingency, is actually a necessary feature for any use of the concept at al1.95 The im­ plication of Kant's argument is that paradoxes may arise in the attempt to derive metaphysical knowledge from the conditions of sensibility.
 
 One such paradox is that if the world is represented as existing in space and time, then the world must be both finite and infinite. Now Kant's argument further implies that such paradoxes can be avoided because we can have intellectual knowledge of reality independently of the con­ cepts of space and time as conditions of "sensitive cognition." Finally, Kant concludes the section by mentioning, almost as an af­ terthought, that there are certain "principles of convenience" (principia convenientiae) that are not principles of sensitive cognition but rather rules by means of which "it seems to the intellect itself easy and practi­ cal to deploy its own perspicacity." These are the principles that "all things in the universe take place in accordance with the order of nature," that "principles are not to be multiplied beyond what is absolutely necessary," and that "nothing material at all comes into being or passes away. "96 This is a striking list, because it includes two principles -the principle of univer­ sal causation and the principle of the conservation of (material) sub­ stance -that Kant will later identify as "constitutive" or necessary conditions of the possibility of the experience of objects at all, but an­ other one -the principle traditionally called "Ockham's razor" -that is more like what he will later identify as a "regulative" principle, which is not a necessary condition of the possibility of any experience at all but an assumption we make for various subjective reasons.
 
 The fact that Kant could indiscriminately mix what he would later distinguish as constitutive and regulative principles shows that he did not yet have a clear conception of the function of the former as neces­ sary conditions of the possibility of experience, a consequence of the fact that he did not yet have a clear understanding that the pure con­ cepts of the understanding (such as the concepts of causation and sub­ stance mentioned in these principles) can yield knowledge only when applied to data furnished by the faculty of sensibility. Likewise, that he could argue at this stage that metaphysical illusion can be avoided by not letting the conditions of sensibility limit the use of concepts of the intellect shoTYS that he did not yet see that the concepts of the under45 Introduction standing have a cognitive use only in application to sensibility and therefore within its limits, and beyond that can have only a practical use.
