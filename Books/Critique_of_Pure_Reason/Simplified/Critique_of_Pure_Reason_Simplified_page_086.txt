In short, most of Kant’s changes in the second edition came from his wish to improve and defend his idea called transcendental idealism. He wanted to show that only this idea could explain how we know things before experience and also prove it works with the real existence of things outside of us.

Besides that, Kant wanted to highlight how reason is important in practical life, not just in theory. He also kept trying to clearly explain his categories. Because of these goals, he made big changes to his introduction, the "Transcendental Aesthetic," and the chapter about phenomena and noumena. He also completely rewrote his preface, the "Transcendental Deduction" of the categories, and the "Paralogisms of Pure Reason."

About this translation: This is a brand new translation of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. We tried to give readers the same experience as those reading the original German version. We wanted to leave as much room for interpretation in the translation as in the original.

This meant we had to be very consistent in translating Kant’s special words. Whenever possible, we used the same English word for the same important German word. Sometimes one English word had to cover several German words, like "Gegenstand" and "Object," which both translate as "object." When this happened, we explained the difference in footnotes but didn’t decide which meaning was right.

Because of this goal, we kept Kant’s sentences whole, even if breaking them up would have made them easier to read. We also kept unclear or confusing parts of the original text when possible, instead of changing them, as long as the original still made some sense.
