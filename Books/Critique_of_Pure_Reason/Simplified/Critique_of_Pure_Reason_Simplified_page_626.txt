Critique of all speculative theology experience, so all conditions needed to think about an object for such a concept make it possible to say it makes any sense.

The second big idea of just thinking things through is the concept of the world as a whole. Nature is the one real thing we have, and reason needs rules to understand it. Nature is two kinds: either thinking nature or physical nature. When we think about physical nature and how it works inside, we don’t need any ideas beyond what we can experience, because we are guided by what we can sense. This is different from thinking about the self (“I”), which already has a built-in way of thinking, like being one whole.

So for pure reason, all we have left is nature in general and the complete set of conditions inside it, based on one principle. The idea of the total chain of these conditions is something we can never fully see in real life, but it helps guide us. When we explain things we see, we should act like this chain goes on forever, without end.

But when reason itself is the cause (like in freedom), and when we think about practical rules, we should act like the object isn’t something we sense but something understood purely. In that case, the conditions aren’t in the chain of appearances but outside it, and the chain of states could be seen as starting completely from an intelligent cause. This shows that big cosmological ideas are just guiding rules and don’t really prove a full total chain exists. You can learn more about this in the Antinomy of Pure Reason.

The third idea of pure reason is the idea of God, who is seen as the only cause of all cosmological chains. But we have no real reason to believe or assume this idea is absolutely true or real, because nothing really justifies us in thinking or saying so.
