When I have a bunch of different things in my mind that I see or imagine, I understand them as one whole because my brain connects them together using special rules called categories.

This means that when I’m aware of these different things, my mind automatically organizes them in a way that makes sense, even before I think about it. These categories help me put everything together so I can understand it as one thing.

In the earlier part, I started to explain how these categories work, showing that they come from my mind itself and not from what I see or feel. So, I focus only on how my mind joins everything together, not on how I get the information from outside.

Later on, I will explain more about how what I see and feel fits with these categories, proving that the way my mind organizes things is the same for anything I experience through my senses.

However, there’s one thing I couldn’t ignore: the fact that the different parts I see have to be there first before my mind can put them together. But how they got there in the first place isn’t explained here.

If I imagine a mind that can see everything at once without needing to put things together—like a perfect or divine mind—then these categories wouldn’t matter. Categories only help minds like ours, which have to organize what we get from outside into one clear picture before we can understand it.
