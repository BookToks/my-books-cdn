Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter I

The outer world we sense is different from our inner experiences because outer sense depends on space, while inner sense depends only on time.

But if we think about it, the two kinds of objects aren’t really different inside; they only seem different because one appears outside the other. So, the idea that matter exists as a thing on its own might not be so different after all. This clears up some confusion. The only real problem left is understanding how different substances can exist together, which is a question beyond psychology. As explained earlier, this is also beyond what humans can fully understand.

A general note about moving from thinking about the mind to thinking about the universe:

Saying “I think” or “I exist because I think” is based on experience. This means it depends on what we sense, which is just an appearance. So, it might seem like even our thinking is just an illusion, and our consciousness isn’t real.

But thinking itself is just how we logically put ideas together. It doesn’t show us how we really are or how we seem to ourselves. Instead, when I think about myself, I do it the same way I think about any object, without focusing on how I sense myself. When I think of myself as the one who thinks, this doesn’t mean I am a physical thing or a cause, because those ideas only apply when thinking about things we sense. When I focus only on thinking, ignoring how I sense myself, it might seem like my thinking is just an appearance—but not the fact that I am thinking. In pure thinking, I am the being itself, although thinking alone doesn’t tell me anything else about myself.

The statement “I think” means more than just a logical function; it shows that the subject (me) exists. But this can’t happen without inner sense, which always presents the object not as it really is, but only as it appears.
