Maybe that last idea was just a quick mistake, because in the next note Kant says that "The transcendent principles are about how our reason keeps things consistent with itself"; "Objective principles are about how we can use experience."  

This means that the transcendent principles of pure reason don’t help us learn about things outside ourselves. We can only understand outside things by using what we learn from experience, applying ideas to what we see and feel in space and time.  

Kant goes on to explain four conflicts between two types of principles. One type is about how we understand appearances and keep our experience consistent. The other type is about how reason tries to understand everything fully. These conflicts match the four big problems he talks about in his book, the Critique.  

The first group of principles says: 1) There’s no absolute total in putting things together, so things can go on forever. 2) There’s no absolute simple thing that can’t be broken down. 3) There’s no absolute starting point that happens by itself. 4) There’s no absolute necessity.  

The second group, from reason, says: 1) There is an absolute total whole. 2) There is an absolute simple thing. 3) There is an absolute spontaneous action. 4) There is an absolute necessary being.  

Kant says the second group of ideas is necessary for how reason works when we try to understand everything together. He starts to explain why these ideas are practically important but doesn’t finish.  

But he clearly moves away from the idea that reason alone can give us real knowledge about objects without using our own thinking.  

So, by 1777, Kant seemed to have planned his Critique like this: (1) explaining space and time as pure ways we see things, which he had already done in 1770; (2) showing how three ideas—substance, cause, and interaction—are needed to explain appearances through space and time, but only work in that context; and (3) presenting four pairs of opposing ideas, where the ones that work for appearances are set against the transcendent ideas that reason uses without limits, which don’t have real validity but can help unify what we know from experience and have some unclear practical use.
