Before Kant could move from his first dissertation to writing the Critique of Pure Reason, he needed to come up with a new way to think about how we use our minds. He had to figure out the differences between using understanding based on what we sense, the mistaken use of pure thinking without experience, and the trustworthy use of pure practical reason.

After publishing his dissertation, Kant stayed quiet for a long time, only writing a few small essays and some letters to his student Marcus Herz. Herz had helped defend Kant’s dissertation and was now in Berlin studying medicine, while also talking with important philosophers there.

Most of what we know about Kant’s ideas during these years comes from notes and comments he made in the margins of books. These notes are only small pieces of what he wrote, so we have to be careful when using them. Even so, they show us how some of the key ideas in the Critique started to develop and help explain some of the confusing parts.

In the fall of 1770, Herz took copies of Kant’s dissertation to famous thinkers in Berlin like Mendelssohn, Johann Heinrich Lambert, and Johann Georg Sulzer, along with letters from Kant. Only the letter to Lambert still exists. In it, Kant apologizes for not keeping a previous promise to work together and promises to quickly publish a book about the metaphysics of morals, although he didn’t actually start this for another fifteen years. He also showed he still believed in the ideas from his dissertation.

By Christmas, all three philosophers had written back with the same main question: how could Kant say that time is just something we experience and not something real? They argued that since time is how we feel changes inside ourselves, and we all experience these changes directly, time must be real. Lambert first asked if Kant’s two ways of knowing—through the senses and through thinking—were really so separate that they never connect. Then he talked mostly about Kant’s ideas on time, agreeing that time is continuous and something we can understand clearly, but disagreeing with Kant’s idea that time is only a way we see things and not something real. He said that all changes happen in time and we can’t imagine change without time.
