It’s already lucky if someone only knows the outside surface of something.

No created spirit can truly understand the inner nature of things. In his book on Logic, Kant explains a rule: if something belongs to a group or contradicts it, then it also applies to everything in that group. This rule comes from the idea that if a feature belongs to a thing, it belongs to the thing itself, and if it contradicts that feature, it contradicts the thing too.

This idea comes from the fact that a concept is like a smaller part of an object’s features. Usually, it’s just a part, because having a complete idea of something is more of a perfect goal than reality.

For example, Leibniz talks about this in his Principles of Nature and Grace.

Kant also mentions that philosophers Wolff and Baumgarten start by explaining the difference between what’s possible and impossible. They say something is impossible only if it contradicts itself logically.

There are drafts of this idea written down by Kant in his notes from the late 1700s.

Kant used the word "dialectic" early on to mean the study of how our understanding works when we think something is definitely true. Around 1769, he found what he called the "antinomies of pure reason," which are contradictions in thinking. He wrote about these in several notes and papers from that time. He even said that year gave him a lot of insight.

But in his first big work in 1770, Kant said that mistakes in metaphysics happen because people try to limit pure reason by what they can sense, instead of realizing that ideas from pure reason alone can’t give us real knowledge. This is something he hinted at in his earlier notes and later writings.
