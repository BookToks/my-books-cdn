Only by using criticism can we get rid of bad ideas like materialism, believing everything is predetermined, not believing in any gods, wild guessing, and superstition. These ideas can be harmful to everyone. It also helps fight against idealism and doubt, which are more dangerous in schools and hard to explain to regular people.

If governments care about helping scholars, it would be smarter for them to support the freedom to criticize ideas. This kind of criticism helps make sure our thinking is solid. Instead, schools act like bosses and get upset when someone challenges their old ideas, even though the public doesn’t really care about those old ideas or miss them when they’re gone.

Criticism doesn’t go against science, which needs to be based on clear rules and proof. Instead, criticism fights against stubborn thinking that assumes it knows everything without checking how or why it knows it. This stubborn thinking ignores the need to question its own limits.

So, criticism isn’t about being shallow or just doubting everything. It’s a necessary step to make metaphysics—a study of things beyond the physical world—a real, serious science. Metaphysics has to follow strict rules and be very careful with its ideas because it deals with pure thinking.

In the future, when metaphysics becomes a solid science, it will have to follow the careful method used by the philosopher Wolff. He showed how to build science step by step, by clearly defining ideas and proving things carefully without jumping to conclusions. He was good at this, but he didn’t prepare the foundation by questioning pure reason itself first. This flaw wasn’t really his fault but was common in his time. Philosophers before him also didn’t blame themselves for this.
