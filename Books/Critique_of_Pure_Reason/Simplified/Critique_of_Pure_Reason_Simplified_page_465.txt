Perception, or the simple idea of “I,” is important by itself, even if I don’t know exactly what makes up the “I” or how it exists. Being aware of myself is real, and its simplicity is already possible. Nothing real in space is simple because points, which are the simplest things in space, are just boundaries and don’t actually make up space as parts.

This shows that materialism can’t explain how I exist as a thinking being. The statement “I exist thinking” is based on experience and only talks about my existence in relation to my thoughts over time. But to understand this, I need something that stays the same. Since I don’t get that from just looking inside myself, I can’t figure out if I exist as a substance or just an accident by only being aware of myself.

If materialism can’t explain my existence, then spiritualism can’t either. So, we can’t really know anything about what our soul is made of, or if it can exist on its own.

How could we ever understand more than what we experience about ourselves? We only know our consciousness because we need it to have experiences, and we can’t use the simple idea “I think” to learn about all thinking beings.

So, there is no real science of the soul that can give us more than what we already know about ourselves. Instead, it teaches us where reason can’t go—so we don’t fall into soulless materialism or get lost in baseless spiritual ideas. This limits our reason and reminds us to stop wasting time on pointless questions about life after death. Instead, we should focus on using self-knowledge in practical ways that help us live better, even if it’s only about things we can experience. Our actions should be guided by principles that feel like they come from something higher, as if our purpose goes beyond just this life.
