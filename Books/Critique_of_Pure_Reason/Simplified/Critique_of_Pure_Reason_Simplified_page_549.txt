Understanding how we sense things in two different ways doesn’t go against what we know about how things appear and how we experience them. Since these appearances aren’t the real things themselves, they must come from something beyond our senses that makes them show up as they do. This “something” can have another kind of cause that isn’t part of what we see, even though we notice its effects in what appears.

Every cause has a rule or law that makes it a cause. So, for anything we sense, it has one side that follows natural laws and connects with other things we see in the world. This part is called its “empirical character.” But it also has another side, called its “intelligible character,” which causes things to happen but doesn’t follow the rules of what we can sense or see. The first is how it appears to us, the second is what it really is on its own.

This “acting subject” with its intelligible character doesn’t exist in time like things we sense do, because time only applies to what we experience. It doesn’t start or stop happening, and it isn’t bound by the cause-and-effect rules of the natural world. Its cause is intellectual and doesn’t depend on anything we observe. We can’t know this side directly because we only know things as they appear, but we have to think about it as connected to what we do experience, just like we imagine there’s something real behind what we see even if we don’t know exactly what it is.

When this subject shows itself in what we experience, it represents something, and if it has reason, its desire or will shows its ability to cause things. If pure reason causes something, then the will is pure and its cause is called freedom.

We can’t know for sure ahead of time what causes things or how they relate, except by experience. So, whether freedom really exists can’t be decided just by thinking; we need experience to understand it.
