If we stop relying on our senses, how can we understand that our ideas (which would be the only concepts left for things we can't sense) still mean anything? For these ideas to connect to any object, we need more than just thinking; we need a way to picture or sense them. But even so, the idea of a "noumenon" (a thing as it is in itself, not how we sense it) is still useful. It helps us understand the limits of what we can sense. 

However, this "noumenon" isn’t a special kind of thing we can understand clearly. Instead, it’s a problem: how can we know something not by thinking about it step by step, but by directly sensing it in a way we can’t even imagine? This idea makes our understanding bigger in a negative way—it’s not just about what we can sense, but about what we can’t sense, which we call "things in themselves" or noumena. But because we can’t know these things through our usual ideas, we only think about them as some unknown “something.”

Some modern writers use the terms "world of sense" and "world of understanding" very differently from how ancient thinkers did. This isn’t really a deep idea but just confusing wordplay. According to their use, the "world of sense" means all the things we see and experience, while the "world of understanding" means how we think about these things using general rules. For example, theoretical astronomy is just observing stars (the world of sense), but contemplative astronomy uses big ideas like the Copernican system or Newton’s laws to explain what we see (the world of understanding). 

We shouldn’t call this an "intellectual world" because only thoughts or feelings are intellectual or sensitive. Instead, objects must be called either intelligible (understood by thinking) or sensible (known by sensing), even if the words sound strange.
