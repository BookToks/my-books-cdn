I will take a quick look at pure reason—that is, how our thinking works—by looking at everything it has done so far. When I do, I see many ideas, but most of them are broken or not fully built.

It's pretty interesting that, when philosophy was just starting out, people focused on things we now think of last. They began by studying God, hope, and the idea of another world.

Even though old religious customs were pretty rough and not always clear, some smarter people still tried to understand these big questions on their own. They knew that the best way to please the invisible power that rules the world—and to be happy after this life—was by living a good life. So, theology (study of God) and morality (right and wrong) were the main reasons people used their thinking skills. Theology was the first that slowly led to what we now call metaphysics, the study of things beyond the physical world.

I won’t go into when certain changes in metaphysics happened, but I will quickly explain the main ideas that caused big shifts. There are three main views that caused the biggest changes in this ongoing debate.

First, about what we can truly know: some philosophers focused only on what we can feel with our senses, while others believed in thinking with the mind alone. Epicurus was a key philosopher who trusted what we feel, while Plato focused more on the mind and ideas. This difference in thinking has been around since the very beginning and has never stopped.
