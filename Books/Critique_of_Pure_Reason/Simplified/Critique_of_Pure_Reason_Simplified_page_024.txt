In the second chapter of "Analytic of Principles," Kant organizes the main ideas of pure understanding into four groups, matching four sets of categories.

For the first two groups, called "Quantity" and "Quality," Kant gives one "mathematical" rule each. These rules make sure that parts of math apply to real things we experience. The first rule, called "Axioms of Intuition," says that the math of measuring things by parts works because we experience objects in space and time, which can be measured this way.

This means that when we use words like one, some, or all, we are actually dividing what we see and feel into separate parts in space and time. The second rule, called "Anticipations of Perception," says that some qualities like color or heat change in degrees. So, we have to use math that works with these changing amounts because our feelings about them can be stronger or weaker.

Kant explains that using yes or no to describe these qualities depends on these changing feelings. This connection between qualities and math is something new that we can't guess just by thinking about the words themselves.

Next, Kant moves from math rules to "dynamical" rules in the third part called the "Analogies of Experience." These rules explain how things in space and time relate to each other. Many people think this is the most important part of his work.

In the first rule, Kant says that because time is one whole, any change must happen in something that stays the same underneath, like a substance that doesnâ€™t change in amount. The second rule says that we can only say events happen in order for real reasons if every change follows a cause-and-effect rule.

The third rule says that we can only say things in different places exist at the same time if they affect each other in some way.
