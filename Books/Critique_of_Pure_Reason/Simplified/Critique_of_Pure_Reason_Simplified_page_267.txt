Part II, Division I, Book I, Chapter II. The mind itself just puts together and organizes what we know, but the actual information comes from the object we are noticing. Our understanding is special because it can connect everything we experience by using certain basic ideas called categories. We don’t really know why these specific categories exist or why space and time are the only ways we can sense things.

Section 22.

Categories only help us understand things we experience.

Thinking about something and actually knowing it are not the same.

There are two parts to knowing something: first, the idea or concept that lets us think about it (the category), and second, the way we sense or see it (intuition). If we had a concept but no way to sense the object, then we would only have an idea without any real thing to connect it to. Since all our sensing comes from what we can feel or see, thinking about something using just a concept only becomes real knowledge if that idea matches something we can sense.

Sensing can be pure, like space and time themselves, or based on actual experiences where we feel or see things happening in space and time.

By understanding space and time, we can know some things in math before we actually experience them, but only about their shape or form. We don’t know for sure if things really exist exactly like that. So, math ideas alone don’t give us real knowledge unless we assume things can appear that way.

Things that exist in space and time are only real to us when we sense them, meaning when we actually experience them.

The pure ideas we have, even when used with math, only help us understand things as long as they connect to real experiences.
