Kant wanted to protect the scientific nature of metaphysics from people who didn’t believe its arguments were strong enough and from those who thought the arguments were just boring and unnecessary. He compared strict metaphysicians to people who support dictators, skeptics to wanderers who hate any stable society and want to destroy metaphysics, and followers of Locke to liars who try to give metaphysics a fake and bad history. He also said that people who act like they don’t care about metaphysics are actually secret supporters of bad ideas, pretending to be detached but having no real beliefs of their own.

Because of this, Kant had to not only challenge old metaphysical ideas but also create a new, scientific version of metaphysics. This new metaphysics would show what can be known without experience but also set limits, only including what’s needed for everyday life and science. He had to limit the claims of the strict metaphysicians while still proving metaphysics is possible (which skeptics denied) and necessary (which indifferent people denied). So, Kant had to fight many battles at once. He had to show that many metaphysical questions can’t be answered for sure, against both strict thinkers and experience-based thinkers. At the same time, he had to defend some ideas, like the ability to know basic principles of science without experience, against both skeptics and experience-only believers. He also wanted to prove to those who didn’t care that metaphysics matters, but he agreed with them a little, saying that for some deep, unsolvable questions—like belief in God, freedom, and life after death—we can trust common sense because our morals depend on these beliefs.

The Critique of Pure Reason is very complicated because of all these ideas. Many people find it hard to understand because of its complex structure, but knowing why it’s divided a certain way can help. Even though the ideas are new, Kant borrowed the book’s structure from well-known examples.

After the preface (which Kant rewrote for the second edition) and the introduction, the book is split into two main parts: the "Doctrine of Elements" and the "Doctrine of Method." This split is like a common idea in German logic books between "general logic" and "special logic." For Kant, the "Doctrine of Elements" explains the basics of his theory about what can be known without experience and its limits. The "Doctrine of Method" talks about how to use that theory, comparing math and philosophy, theory and practice, and his own way of thinking with other ways like strict, experience-based, or skeptical philosophy.
