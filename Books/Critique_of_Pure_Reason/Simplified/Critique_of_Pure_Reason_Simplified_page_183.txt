Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic

Someone might say that a rainbow is just something we see during a sun-shower, but the rain itself is the real thing. This is true if we think about rain in a physical way, as something we can always sense the same way no matter where we are. But if we think about the rain not just as drops we see, but as the actual thing itself, then the question becomes deeper. Not only are the raindrops just appearances, but even their round shape and the space they fall through aren't real by themselves. They are just parts of how we sense things. The real object behind all this is something we can’t really know.

The second big point of our study is that it shouldn't just seem like a good guess, but it should be as certain and clear as any strong theory needs to be. To prove this certainty, we will look at an example where it’s really obvious.

If we thought that space and time were real things on their own and conditions for things to exist, then we would find many absolutely true and necessary statements about them, especially about space. We will study space first. Since the statements of geometry are known to be definitely true and certain before any experience, I ask: Where do these statements come from? How do we understand such necessary and universal truths? The answer is that we get these through either concepts or direct experiences, and these can be learned before experience (a priori) or after (a posteriori). Concepts based on experience and the experiences themselves can only give us statements that are true in our experience, not ones that are absolutely necessary like in geometry. On the other hand, pure concepts alone can only give us analytic knowledge, which means they don’t add anything new. For example, the statement that two straight lines can’t...
