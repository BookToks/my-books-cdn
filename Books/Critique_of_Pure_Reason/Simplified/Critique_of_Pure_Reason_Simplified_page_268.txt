The pure ideas our mind uses to understand things don’t help us know things by themselves. They only work when we connect them to things we can actually experience with our senses.

This is what we call experience. So, these ideas only help us understand things if those things can be experienced.

This idea is very important because it shows the limits of how we can use these pure ideas to understand objects. Just like space and time only apply to things we can sense, these ideas only work for things we can experience.

The pure ideas in our mind aren’t limited like space and time. They can apply to any kind of sensory experience, even if it’s different from our own. But using these ideas beyond what we can sense doesn’t help us understand anything. Without a way to experience something, these ideas are empty and don’t show us if the thing is real or not.

If you try to think about something that can’t be sensed, you can say what it isn’t—like it’s not in space or time, and it doesn’t change over time. But that’s not real knowledge because you don’t know what it actually is. Without a way to experience it, you can’t truly understand it or apply your ideas to it. So, none of the basic concepts our mind uses can be used to understand something that can’t be sensed.
