The Critique of Pure Reason is the book where Kant tried to explain how modern science can be certain and how people can have freedom.

The book is hard to understand, not just because Kant’s ideas are complicated, but also because he argues against many other ideas from early modern philosophy, especially those from the German Enlightenment.

Kant wanted to support both modern science and human freedom. Like other thinkers such as Descartes, Locke, and Hume, he tried to limit the power of traditional metaphysics. This old way of thinking was represented by Christian Wolff and his followers, like Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten. Kant called this "dogmatism" and compared it to a strict and unfair monarchy. He thought dogmatism was unstable, full of opinions, and not trustworthy.

Kant also wanted to show that his way of criticizing dogmatism was different from other ways that also rejected it but were dangerous to reason. One of these was skepticism, which he thought David Hume supported. Another was empiricism, which said knowledge only comes from personal experience, as explained by John Locke. Kant also talked about indifferentism, a view that didn’t reject metaphysics but refused to argue for it carefully. Some philosophers believed in things like God or the soul but thought these beliefs came from common sense, not deep proofs.

While Kant criticized traditional metaphysics, he also defended its idea that some knowledge is universal and necessary. He called this a priori knowledge, meaning knowledge that doesn’t come from experience. He said knowledge based only on experience, called a posteriori knowledge, can’t be certain for everyone.
