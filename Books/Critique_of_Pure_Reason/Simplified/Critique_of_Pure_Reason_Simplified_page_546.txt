The idea of freedom in nature means something needs a cause to happen. But freedom, in a special way, means being able to start something by yourself without needing another cause to make it happen first.

This kind of freedom is a pure idea that doesn’t come from experience. Also, you can’t find a clear example of it in real life because everything we see follows the rule that every event has a cause. So, nature works like a chain of causes, one leading to another, and there’s no end to it. But since there’s no absolute first cause, reason thinks up the idea of a kind of freedom that can act on its own without being caused by anything else.

This idea of freedom is really important because it forms the base for the practical idea of freedom that people talk about. The practical idea of freedom means being able to choose without being forced by feelings or outside influences. When a choice is controlled by feelings, it’s called an animal-like choice. But humans have a special kind of choice that isn’t controlled by feelings alone. People can decide things for themselves, independent of what their feelings try to push them to do.

If everything in the world was just natural causes, then every action would be forced by the one before it, meaning no one would really have free choice. But humans don’t just follow this chain—they have the power to decide for themselves.
