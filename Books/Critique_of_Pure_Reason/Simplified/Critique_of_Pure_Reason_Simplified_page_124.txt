When we think about certain things only using reason, and we have to think about them that way, we can’t experience them directly. But since we have to be able to think about them, trying to do so helps us test a new way of thinking. This new way says that we can only know things before experience if we put those ideas into them ourselves.

This test works really well and gives metaphysics a solid start, especially when it deals with ideas that come before experience and match things we can actually experience. After changing how we think, we can explain how it’s possible to know things before experience. Even better, we can prove the rules that explain nature as the sum of everything we experience — something we couldn’t do with the older way of thinking.

This new method is copied from how people study nature. It means looking for pure ideas by testing them with experiments. But pure reason ideas, especially those that go beyond anything we can experience, can’t be tested by experiments like in science. So, the only way to test is by looking at ideas in two ways: one as things we can experience with our senses and understanding, and the other as things we only think about with reason, beyond experience.

If we find that these two views agree, but there’s a conflict when we only look at one view, then the test shows that this difference is correct.

However, in the first part of metaphysics, we find a strange and not so good result: with this way of thinking, we can never go beyond what we can experience. But going beyond experience is actually the most important goal of this science.
