As for BXV1l1 objects insofar as they are thought merely through reason, and necessarily at that, but that (at least as reason thinks them) cannot be given in experience at all-the attempt to think them (for they must be capable of being thought) will provide a splendid touchstone of what we assume as the altered method of our way of thinking, namely that we can cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have put into them.* This experiment succeeds as well as we could wish, and it promises to metaphysics the secure course of a science in its first part, where it concerns itself with concepts priori to which the corresponding objects ap­ a propriate to them can be given in experience. For after this alteration in BXlX our way oft hinking we can very well explain the possibility of a cognition priori, and what is still more, we can provide satisfactory proofs of a the laws that are the priori ground of nature, as the sum total of objects a of experience -which were both impossible according to the earlier way of proceeding. But from this deduction of our faculty of cognizing pria * This method, imitated from the method of those who study nature, thus con- Bxviii sists in this: to seek the elements of pure reason in that which admits of being confirmed or refuted through an experiment. Now the propositions of pure reason, especially when they venture beyond all boundaries of possible experience, admit of no test by experiment with their objects" (as in natural science): thus to experiment will be feasible only with concepts and principles that we assume priori by arranging the latter so that the same a objects can be considered from two different sides, on the one side as objects of the senses and the understanding for experience, and on the other Bxix side as objects that are merely thought at most for isolated reason striving beyond the bounds of experience. If we now find that there is agreement with the principleb of pure reason when things are considered from this twofold standpoint, but that an unavoidable conflict of reason with itself arises with a single standpoint, then the experiment decides for the correctness of that distinction.
 
 Objecte a Princip b 111 Preface ori in the first part of metaphysics, there emerges a very strange result, and one that appears very disadvantageous to the whole purpose with which the second part of metaphysics concerns itself, namely that with this faculty we can never get beyond the boundaries of possible experi­ ence, which is nevertheless precisely the most essential occupation of BXX this science.
