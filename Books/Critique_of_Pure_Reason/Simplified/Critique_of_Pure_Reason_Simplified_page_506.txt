If you think it’s hard to figure out if there’s a cause that must exist without any other cause before it, then these problems don’t just come from the idea of something having to exist. Instead, they come from trying to connect causes in a series, where you want to find a cause that isn’t caused by anything else. So, the problems are about the world and how things happen, not just ideas.  

We need to show that when we look at causes in the world around us, we can never reach a cause that is completely uncaused by anything else. The argument that the world’s changes depend on other things goes against the idea that there is a first cause that started everything without being caused itself.  

There’s a weird difference in this problem: the same proof that says a first cause must exist is also used to say it doesn’t exist, and both are argued very strongly.  

First, some say there must be a necessary being because all past events include all causes, so there must be something that isn’t caused by anything else. But then others say there is no necessary being because all past events are connected and depend on other events, so everything is caused by something else.  

The reason for this is that the first argument looks at the entire series of causes as a whole and says that something necessary must exist. The second argument focuses on the fact that each cause depends on a previous cause in time, making everything dependent and none truly necessary.  

Both arguments make sense to normal human thinking, which often gets confused and contradicts itself when looking at things from different points of view. This kind of confusion has even caused famous scientists to argue about similar problems.
