The first extensive outlines for the eventual "Dialectic" of the published Critique are found at R 4756-60 (1775-77, 17:699-713). A striking feature of these outlines is that at this point Kant foresaw the pre­ sentation of the "Dialectic" in terms of a tripartite contrast between "im­ manent principles of the empirical use of the understanding" and "transcendent principles of the pure use of reason" (R 4757, 1T703) or a quadripartite contrast between "the principles of the exposition of appear­ ances" and the "principles of rationality" (R 4759, 17:709-ro), in which, in particular, competing claims about the simplicity of the self would be treated under the general issue of the decomposition of the complex into the sim­ ple, and all issues about God would be treated under the heading of neces­ sity; in other words, at this point the subject matter of the eventual "Paralogisms of Pure Reason" and the "Ideal of Pure Reason" were to be treated under the second and fourth antinomies respectively, and there was no division of the "Dialectic" into three main parts. R 5 109 (1776-78, 18:9°-92) does not yet suggest any departure from this plan, although R 4849, from the same period, does suggest the division between the "Paralogisms" and the "Antinomies" (18:5-8). By the time of the important R 5553 (1778-79,18:221-9), however, the threefold division of the whole "Dialectic" and the fourfold subdivision of each of its three main parts was clearly in place (see 18:223); this note is the single most important draft of the "Dialectic." For later comments, see also R 5642 (dated 1780-81, but clearly written after the publication of the first edition of the Critique; 18:279-82) and R 5962 (1785-89, 18:401-5).
 
 2 For Kant, "probability" is the holding of a proposition for true on insuffi­ cient ground, whether the insufficiency is objective or subjective. See A820-31B848-51 and Logic 9:81-6.
 
 3 Kant discusses the understanding as a law-governed power, comparing the laws of the understanding with the rules of grammar in the Logic 9: I1 -13.
 
 4 Compare Kant's discussion of sensory illusion in the Anthropology § 8, 7:146.
 
 5 See R 4930 (1776-78, 18:31-2), where Kant draws a distinction between Amrhein or apparentia as error due to lack of judgment and unavoidable naturliche Schein or species, of which transcendentale Schein is an instance.
 
 6 Inference is the derivation of one judgment from another (Logic § 41,9:114).
 
 In immediate inferences, which Kant calls "inferences of the understand­ ing," the judgment is derived directly, without the aid of any other infer­ ence. Such inferences include those from the universal affirmative to the particular affirmative (Logic § 46, 9:II6), the denial of the contradictory, contrary, and sub contrary (Logic §§ 47-50, 9:II6-18), the rules of conver­ sion (Logic §§ sr-3, 9:118-9), and contraposition (Logic §§ 54-5, 9:119).
 
 Mediate inferences, or "inferences of reason," infer one proposition from another by means of a third. Under this heading, Kant includes the theory of syllogisms (Logic §§ 56-9, 120-1).
 
 7 This contrast between understanding and reason is anticipated at R 5553 (1778-79, 18:22 1-9, at p. 224).
 
 8 See previous note.
 
 9 Kant's threefold division of syllogisms according to the form of the major premise is presented in Logic §§ 60-I, 9:I21-2.
