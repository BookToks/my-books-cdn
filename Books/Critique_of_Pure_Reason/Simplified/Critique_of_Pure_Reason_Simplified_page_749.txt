The first detailed plans for the "Dialectic" part of Kant’s Critique are found in notes from 1775-77. At this time, Kant thought about showing the "Dialectic" as a contrast between three main ideas: the rules for how we understand things based on experience, and the rules for how pure reason works without experience. Sometimes, he also thought about it as four parts: rules about how things appear and rules about rational thinking.

In these notes, Kant planned to deal with ideas about the self and God under certain categories. For example, questions about the self’s simplicity would be about breaking down complex things into simple ones, and questions about God would be about necessity. Back then, he didn’t divide the "Dialectic" into three big parts yet. Later notes from 1776-78 still follow this plan, but one note from the same time suggests splitting the "Paralogisms" and the "Antinomies" apart.

By 1778-79, Kant clearly divided the whole "Dialectic" into three main parts, each with four smaller parts. This was a very important draft of the "Dialectic." Later notes, written after the first edition of the Critique, also talk about this division.

For Kant, "probability" means believing something is true even when the reasons for it are not strong enough, whether the weakness is in the thing itself or in our thinking.

Kant talks about the understanding (how we think) as following rules, like grammar rules in language.

He also discusses sensory illusions, which are mistakes made by our senses, in his Anthropology work.

Kant makes a difference between mistakes caused by bad judgment and unavoidable illusions that naturally happen to us, with "transcendental illusions" being one kind of these natural mistakes.

Inference means drawing a conclusion from something else.

Immediate inferences happen when you get a conclusion right away from one judgment without needing another step. Examples include going from a general statement to a specific one or denying the opposite.

Mediate inferences happen when you use a third idea to connect two judgments. This includes things like syllogisms, where you have a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion.

The difference between understanding and reason is already mentioned in Kant’s notes from 1778-79.

Kant also divides syllogisms into three types based on the form of the major premise.

In addition to earlier notes, there are more from 1778-79 that explain these ideas.
