When we think about the mistakes made by pure reason, we have to accept one last idea: all the things we see and experience are just appearances, not things as they really are. We already proved this idea earlier, even before knowing these new details.

If someone asks whether the idea of dualism (the soul being separate from the body) is true in terms of the soul, the answer is yes, but only in how we experience things. For example, the body is what we sense outside us, and the "I" or mind is what we sense inside us. Both are seen as substances or things that appear real to us, and our experiences combine these inner and outer perceptions into one understanding.

But if we try to say dualism is true in a deeper, more absolute way, then that idea doesn’t hold up. Neither dualism, nor the opposite ideas like materialism (only matter exists) or spiritualism (only mind exists), have any real proof. This is because these ideas confuse how we represent things in our minds with how things actually are. The "I," which we feel inside ourselves in time, and objects outside us in space, are different appearances, but that doesn’t mean they are actually different things.

The true cause behind both what we see outside and what we sense inside is not matter or thinking itself, but something unknown that makes these appearances possible. 

So, if we stick to what experience and its objects can actually tell us, we shouldn’t try to guess what things are like on their own, without our senses. But if a psychologist treats appearances as things in themselves, they might say only matter exists (materialism), or only thinking beings exist (spiritualism), or both (dualism). However, this is always a mistake because they are trying to explain something that is just an appearance, not a real thing in itself.
