On the paralogisms of pure reason <A> requires us to take the only refuge remaining to us, namely to grasp the ideality of all appearances, which we have already established in the Transcendental Aesthetic independently of these consequences, which we could not then have foreseen. Now if one asks whether dualism A379 alone holds in the doctrine of the soul, then the answer is: Of course, but only in the empirical sense, i.e., in the connection of experience matter as substance in appearance is really given to outer sense, just as the thinking I is given to inner sense, likewise as substance in appearance; and in the connection of our outer as well as our inner perceptions, appearances on both sides must be connected among themselves into one experience according to the rules that the category of substance brings in. But if one wants to broaden the concept of dualism as it is usually applied and take it in a transcendental sense, then neither it, nor the pneumatism that is opposed to it on the one side, nor the ma足 terialism on the other side, have the least ground, since then one's concepts would lack determination, and one would take the difference in the mode of representing objects, which are unknown to us as to what they are in themselves, for a difference in these things themselves. I, represented through inner sense in time, and objects in space outside me, are indeed specifically a wholly distinct appearances, but they are not thereby thought of as different things. The transcendental objectb that grounds both outer appearances and inner intuition is neither mat- A380 ter nor a thinking being in itself, but rather an unknown ground of those appearances that supply us with our empirical concepts of the former as well as the latter.
 
 If, therefore, as the present critique obviously requires of us, we re足 main true to the rule established earlier not to press our questions be足 yond that with which possible experience and its objectC can supply us, then it will not occur to us to seek information about what the objects of our senses may be in themselves, i.e., apart from any relation to the senses. But if a psychologist takes appearances for things in themselves, then as a materialist he may take up matter into his doctrine, or as a spiritualist he may take up merely thinking beings (namely, according to the form of our inner sense) as the single and sole thing existing in itself, or as a dualist he may take up both; yet through misunderstand足 ing he will always be confined to sophistical reasonings about the way in which that which is no thing in itself, but only the appearance of a thing in general, might exist in itself.
