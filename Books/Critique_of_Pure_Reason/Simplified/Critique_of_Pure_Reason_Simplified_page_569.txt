When we think about everything that exists, we imagine a thing that is completely defined in itself. This idea of the “most real being” means it is an individual thing that has all the qualities that really belong to being.

This idea is like a perfect model that explains why everything that exists is fully determined. It’s the basic reason why anything can exist, and all our thoughts about objects come back to this idea. It’s also the only perfect idea that human reason can fully understand because only here do we have a universal idea that is completely clear and represents one individual thing.

When we use logic to understand concepts, we often use a type of reasoning called a disjunctive syllogism. This means we divide a big group into parts, then focus on one part to define the concept. But we can’t divide the idea of reality itself before experience, because we don’t know any specific kinds of reality without seeing them first. So, the main idea we start with is the total sum of all reality, which includes all possible qualities.

To understand any one thing fully, we pick some qualities from this total reality and leave out others. This matches the “either/or” choice in the logic we use. The way reason works here is similar to how it works in those logical syllogisms. This connection helped explain how all big ideas about reality are organized, based on the three types of logical reasoning.
