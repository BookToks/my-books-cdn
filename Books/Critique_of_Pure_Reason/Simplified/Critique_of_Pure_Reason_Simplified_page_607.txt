Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III explains how we can organize many different powers in a clear way. The basic idea of reason wants us to find unity whenever possible. The more we see that different powers are actually the same, the more likely it is that they come from one main power. We do this with all the powers we find.

These main powers need to be compared again to see if they can be connected to one ultimate, absolutely fundamental power.

But this unity of reason is just a guess. We don’t say such a power definitely exists, but we look for it to help reason work better. This helps us create rules based on experience and organize what we know.

However, when we think about understanding deeply, this idea of a fundamental power isn’t just a guess. It acts like it’s real. We assume that all the many powers in a substance are connected and build a strong principle of reason on this. Even if we haven’t found this unity or fail to find it, we still believe it exists. This happens not just because we want substance to be unified, but also because reason expects that similar powers, like natural laws in matter, fit under bigger, general laws. Using fewer principles isn’t just to keep things simple; it’s part of how reason naturally works.

In fact, it’s hard to see how reason could have a rule for unity unless there is a deeper rule that says such unity must exist before we even look for it. Otherwise, how could reason logically treat many powers as one system?
