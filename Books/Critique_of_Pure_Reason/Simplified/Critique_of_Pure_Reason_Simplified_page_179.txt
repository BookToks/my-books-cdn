Part I. The Transcendental Aesthetic

If you take away the special way we sense things, then the idea of time also disappears. Time doesn’t belong to the things themselves, but only to the person who feels or experiences them.

The reason many people disagree with this idea is because they believe space is definitely real. They think our inner feelings, like being aware of ourselves, are clearly real because we can feel them directly. But outer things might just be an illusion. However, they didn’t realize that both inner feelings and outer things are only appearances. Appearances have two sides: one is the object itself, which is tricky to understand without considering how we sense it; the other is the way we sense the object, which comes from us, not from the object, but still really matters for how we experience it.

Time and space are two ways we understand things. From them, we can get different kinds of knowledge before we even experience anything. For example, pure math is based on space and how things relate in space. Time and space together are the basic forms of all the things we sense, and because of that, they let us make certain true guesses or statements about the world before we check them by experience. But these ways of knowing have limits. Since they are just the way we sense things, they only apply to objects as they appear to us, not to things as they really are in themselves.

This is the only place where they work. Beyond that, they don’t help us understand things objectively. Still, the fact that space and time are real in how we experience things doesn’t change how sure we are about what we learn from experience. Whether space and time belong to things themselves or just to how we sense things, we can be sure about what we experience.

But people who say space and time are absolutely real on their own run into problems. If they say space and time exist by themselves forever (which many scientists who study nature believe), then they must accept that two endless things, space and time, exist without any real objects inside them.
