Trying to explain all the rules for how we understand things without a clear method was really hard. People kept trying to prove these rules in a strict way, but it didn’t work. They tried to prove the “principle of sufficient reason” but always failed. Nobody thought about two other important ideas, even though they used them without realizing it. This happened because they didn’t have the right guide to spot all the gaps in how we think, both in ideas and rules.

Now, here are some basic rules about how we think based on experience:

1. Anything that fits with the way we experience things (using our senses and ideas) is possible.

2. Anything connected to what we actually sense is real.

3. Anything connected to what is real, based on general experience, must exist.

The idea that the whole world is connected comes from assuming that all things happening at the same time are linked. If they were separate, they wouldn’t make a whole, and their connection wouldn’t make sense. We’ve explained before that this connection is what makes it possible to understand things happening together, and that we figure out this connection because of that.

Some notes explain that something is called “contingent” if it depends on a reason or cause, not the other way around. Something is “possible” if we can imagine it in a way that fits with how we experience things. Something is “actual” if it happens at a certain time. And something is “necessary” if it must exist because of how time itself works.
