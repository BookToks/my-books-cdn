The opposite side of pure reason works like smart lawmakers. When judges get confused during a case, lawmakers learn what’s wrong or unclear in their laws. The conflict that shows up when applying the law helps us test rules, so reason, which usually misses its own mistakes when thinking in abstract ways, can pay attention to how it decides its ideas.

This doubting method mostly fits only transcendental philosophy, and we don’t really need it in other areas. In math, it wouldn’t make sense because false ideas don’t hide there. Math proofs have to follow clear, obvious steps based on pure intuition. In science, doubting can help delay a decision, but any confusion can be fixed because experiments finally give the answer, sooner or later. Morality also gives clear rules and examples we can see in real life, so there’s less chance for confusion from abstract ideas.

But transcendental ideas try to go beyond anything we can experience. They can’t be shown in any clear intuition beforehand, and no experience can prove them wrong. So, transcendental reason has no way to test itself except by carefully comparing its own statements. This means these ideas have to be openly debated, which is what we’re about to do.

The first conflict of these big ideas says: The world had a beginning in time, and in space, it has limits.
