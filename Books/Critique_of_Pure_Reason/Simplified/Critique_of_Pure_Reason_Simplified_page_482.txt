The antithetic of pure reason sides, in order to do as wise legislators do when from the embarrass­ ment of judges in cases of litigation they draw instruction concerning that which is defective and imprecisely determined in their laws. The antinomy that reveals itself in the application of the law is for our lim­ ited wisdom the best way to test nomothetics,a in order to make reason, which does not easily become aware of its false steps in abstract specu­ lation, attentive to the moments involved in determining its principles.
 
 This skeptical method, however, is essentially suited only to tran­ scendental philosophy, and can in any case be dispensed with in every other field of investigation, but not in this one. In mathematics its use would be absurd, because nowhere in mathematics do false assertions disguise themselves and make themselves invisible; for mathematical proofs always have to proceed along the lines of pure intuition, and in- A425 deed always through a self-evident synthesis. In experimental philosophy a doubt postponing judgment can be useful, but at least there is no possible misunderstanding that cannot be easily removed, and the ultimate means for deciding the controversy must at last lie in experience, whether it is found early or late. Morality can also give us its principles as a whole in concreto, along with their practical consequences in at least B453 possible experiences, and thereby avoid misunderstandings due to ab­ straction. On the contrary, the transcendental assertions that presume to extend their insight beyond the field of all possible experience are neither in the case where their synthesis could be given in an a priori intuition, nor are they so constituted that a misunderstanding could be exposed by means of any experience. Transcendental reason thus permits no touchstone other than its own attempt to bring internal unification to its assertions, and this requires a free and unhindered contest of these assertions among themselves, which we will now initiate.* * The antinomies follow according to the order of the transcendental ideas in­ troduced above.
