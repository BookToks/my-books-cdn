The German language uses just one word, "explanation," for things like exposition, explication, declaration, and definition. Because of this, we need to relax the rule that says philosophical explanations can’t be called definitions. Instead, we should understand that philosophical definitions explain ideas we already have, while mathematical definitions actually build new ideas from scratch.

Philosophical definitions happen by breaking down ideas we already know (though sometimes they’re still a bit unclear). This process is called analysis, and it’s never 100% certain. Mathematical definitions, on the other hand, create ideas step by step, which is called synthesis. So, math definitions actually make the idea itself, while philosophy just explains it.

From this, we get two important points:

a) In philosophy, you shouldn’t start by giving a definition like in math—unless just as an experiment. Philosophers start with ideas that might be messy or unclear, and then explain them more and more until they get a clear definition at the end. So, definitions in philosophy come last, not first.

But in math, you don’t have any idea before the definition. The definition gives you the idea for the first time, so math always starts with definitions.

b) Mathematical definitions can’t be wrong. Since the idea is created by the definition, it only includes what the definition says.

Philosophy often has wrong or incomplete definitions. But even if a definition isn’t perfect, you can still use it to understand things better. Philosophers don’t always need perfect definitions to work with ideas. Math definitions exist to create ideas, while philosophy definitions exist to improve ideas. Getting perfect definitions is great but usually very hard. For example, lawyers are still trying to find a perfect definition of what “right” means.
