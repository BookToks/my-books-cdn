Trans. deduction of pure concepts of understanding <B> the imagination, on account of the subjective condition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition to the concepts of under­ standing, belongs to sensibility; but insofar as its synthesis is still an exercise of spontaneity, which is determining and not, like sense, merely determinable, and can thus determine the form of sense priori in ac- B 152 a cordance with the unity of apperception, the imagination is to this extent a faculty for determining the sensibility priori, and its synthesis of a intuitions, in accordance with the categories, must be the transcendental synthesis of the imagination, which is an effect of the under­ standing on sensibility and its first application (and at the same time the ground of all others) to objects of the intuition that is possible for us. As figurative, it is distinct from the intellectual synthesis without any imagination merely through the understanding. Now insofar as the imagination is spontaneity, I also occasionally call it the productive imagination, and thereby distinguish it from the reproductive imagination, whose synthesis is subject solely to empirical laws, namely those of association, and that therefore contributes nothing to the explanation of the possibility of cognition priori, and on that account belongs not a in transcendental philosophy but in psychology.
 
 * * * Here is now the place to make intelligible the paradox that must have struck everyone in the exposition of the form of inner sense (§ 6): namely how this presents even ourselves to consciousness only as we appear to ourselves, not as we are in ourselves, since we intuit ourselves B 153 only as we are internally affected, which seems to be contradictory, since we would have to relate to ourselves passively; for this reason it is customary in the systems of psychology to treat inner sense as the same as the faculty of apperception (which we carefully distinguish)Y That which determines the inner sense is the understanding and its original faculty of combining the manifold of intuition, i.e., of bring­ ing it under an apperception (as that on which its very possibility rests).
 
 Now since in us humans the understanding is not itself a faculty of in­ tuitions, and even if these were given in sensibility cannot take them up into itself, in order as it were to combine the manifold of its own intuition, thus its synthesis, considered in itselfa alone, is nothing other than the unity of the action of which it is conscious as such even with­ out sensibility, but through which it is capable of itself determining sensibility internally with regard to the manifold that may be given to it in accordance with the form of its intuition. Under the designation of a transcendental synthesis of the imagination, it therefore exera for sich 257 Doctrine of Elements.
