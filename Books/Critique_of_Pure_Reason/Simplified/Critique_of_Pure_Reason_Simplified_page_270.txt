The imagination helps us connect ideas from our understanding to what we can sense. It works because it can create images or ideas in our mind before we actually experience them through our senses. This means the imagination is not just passive like our senses but active and creative, helping shape what we feel and see based on what our mind understands.

There are two kinds of imagination. The productive imagination is the one that actively creates new images or ideas, while the reproductive imagination only recalls things we've already experienced. The productive imagination is important for how we understand things before we experience them, which is why it belongs to philosophy. The reproductive imagination is more about memory and belongs to psychology.

Now, there’s a tricky idea about how we understand ourselves. We only know ourselves through our feelings and experiences, not as we truly are inside. This sounds strange because it means we experience ourselves passively, like something happening to us. Some psychologists say our inner sense is the same as our self-awareness, but they are actually different.

What controls our inner sense is the understanding, which combines all the different pieces of what we sense into one idea. But humans don’t have understanding as a way to sense things directly. Instead, understanding works with what the senses provide and organizes it into a complete picture. This process is called the transcendental synthesis of the imagination, which means the mind actively puts together what we sense into a meaningful experience.
