We can only understand what desires people have and what naturally satisfies them by experiencing the world.

If we ignore desires and how they get satisfied, and just think about freedom in general, we can figure out the conditions needed for freedom to match up with happiness based on certain rules. This way, we can understand it using pure thought without needing experience.

Let’s assume there are pure moral laws that tell us what to do or not do without thinking about feelings or happiness. These laws are absolute and must always be followed. We can believe in these laws not just because smart thinkers say so, but also because everyone can understand them if they think clearly.

Pure reason, when used in a practical way—like thinking about morals—has rules about what actions can happen in real life. Since these rules say what should happen, these actions must be possible. This creates a special kind of order called the moral order. But reason can’t prove a natural order for everything, only a moral one. Moral rules can guide free actions, but they can’t control natural laws. So, these moral rules are real and important when we use reason to make moral choices.

I call the world that follows all moral laws perfectly a moral world. This is an idea of a world where everyone is free and acts morally, ignoring all the problems or weaknesses humans usually have.

So far, this moral world is just an idea, but it’s a practical one. It should influence the real world and help make it as close as possible to this ideal.
