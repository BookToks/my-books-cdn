For the second edition, Kant added a lot and removed some parts in this chapter before the appendix called "Amphiboly of the Concepts of Reflection." We will show both versions of the chapter up to the appendix, including the parts that stayed the same. The page numbers and notes will point out where the changes happened.

At the start of this chapter in Kant's first edition, there are these notes: "Here’s the question: How far can we have knowledge that is both new and known without experience? If we talk about something using categories just through reason, then those statements are just definitions and don’t give us new knowledge."

Now, about appearance and illusion:

How can we say that bodies are just appearances? They are made up only of pure relations. The soul is just pure combining and separating of these ideas. The "I" (self) is a thing in itself; it is intelligence.

There is a difference between things we sense and things we understand. We can only think about things in themselves, called noumena, but we can’t really know them.

We have to think about things in themselves by imagining the most real being, because that goes beyond experience.

We can easily think of the world as a whole made of substances in space, but not as things in themselves, because these things are separate.

The same things can be seen as things of sense or understanding. I am the only thing that doesn’t sense myself directly.

Categories don’t help us know things as they really are; they only help us organize what we sense in space and time, which are appearances.

People used to believe categories helped us know things directly, but now we see they are just ways of thinking that help us combine what we sense into a unified experience.
