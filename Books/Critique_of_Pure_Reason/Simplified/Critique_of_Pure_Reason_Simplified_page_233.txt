Part II, Division I, Book I, Chapter II talks about proving facts, and since they need proof for both parts, they call the first part—the one that shows who has the right or legal claim—the deduction.

We use many ideas based on experience without anyone questioning them. We believe it’s okay to give these ideas meaning even without a deduction because we can always show proof from experience that they are real. But some ideas, like fortune and fate, are used by almost everyone but sometimes need to prove their right to be used by asking "what is the law?" Then it gets tricky because there is no clear legal reason or proof from experience or logic to support using those ideas.

Among the many ideas people have, some are meant to be used completely without any experience at all. These always need a deduction to show they have the right to be used because proof from experience isn’t enough. Still, we must understand how these ideas can connect to things even though they don’t come from experience. I call the explanation of how ideas can connect to things without experience a "transcendental deduction." This is different from an "empirical deduction," which shows how we learn ideas through experience and thinking about it, and only deals with whether the idea really exists, not if it’s okay to use it.

Now, we have two kinds of ideas that are very different but both connect to things without any experience. These are the ideas of space and time, which come from our senses, and the categories, which come from our understanding. Trying to find proof from experience for these ideas would be useless because what makes them special is that they relate to things without borrowing anything from experience. So, if we need to prove them, it must always be done in this special, transcendental way.

Still, for these ideas, like with all knowledge, we can look to experience—not to find why they are possible in principle, but to find what causes them to appear sometimes. Our senses give the first chance for these ideas to come up.
