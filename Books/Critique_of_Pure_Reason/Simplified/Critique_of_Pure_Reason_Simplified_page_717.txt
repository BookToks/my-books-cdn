Some people think that admitting you don’t know everything is the key to finding the truth, like digging deep into a well. Their motto is, "What I know is enough for me; I don’t care about the hard work of others," which helps them live a happy and respectable life without stressing about science or getting confused by their work.

When it comes to studying science, people can choose to either believe strongly in certain ideas or be doubtful and question everything. But no matter what, they have to follow a clear and organized way of thinking. For example, Wolff represents the first group, and David Hume the second. For now, I won’t mention others.

The only way left is to be critical and careful. If you have enjoyed learning with me so far, then you can decide if you want to help turn this small path into a big road. Maybe, before this century ends, we can finally satisfy human curiosity in a way that many centuries of thinking have not done yet.

The phrase "What I know is enough for me; I don’t care for the labors of Arcesilas or Solon" comes from an old poem, showing that sometimes people just want peace of mind instead of endless questions.

Editors note: When I mention Kant’s works besides the Critique of Pure Reason, I’ll tell you where to find them in the official German collection of his writings, so you can look them up easily.
