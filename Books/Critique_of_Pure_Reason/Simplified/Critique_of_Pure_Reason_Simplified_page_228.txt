The pure ideas of understanding, and even how they fit together in a system, help explain all the parts and their order in a planned science, as I have shown before. Now, here are some notes about this.

First, the table has four groups of understanding concepts, which can be divided into two parts. The first part deals with objects we can imagine or experience, while the second part focuses on whether these objects actually exist, either by themselves or in relation to each other.

I call the first group "mathematical categories" and the second group "dynamical categories." The first group doesn’t have related pairs, but the second group does. This difference must come from how our understanding works.

Second, each group always has three categories. This is interesting because usually, when we divide ideas, we split them into two. But here, the third category comes from combining the first two in each group.

For example, "allness" (or totality) is just many things thought of as one. "Limitation" is reality mixed with what is not real. "Community" means how one thing causes another to happen. And "necessity" means something exists because it could possibly exist. 

Don’t think the third category is just a simple mix of the first two. Making the third category needs a special kind of understanding that’s different from just understanding the first two. For example, the idea of a number (which is in the allness group) isn’t always possible just by thinking about many things and one thing, like when thinking about infinity. Or understanding how one thing causes something in another isn’t just about combining cause and substance. This shows we need a special mental step to get the third idea, and this is true for the others too.

Third, the agreement of one category called "community" matches with a type of logical judgment called a "disjunctive judgment." But this match isn’t as clear as it is for the other categories.

To understand this, remember that in all disjunctive judgments, the group (or many possibilities) involved is important.
