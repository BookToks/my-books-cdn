Dear Lord,

Working to help science grow is also helping you, because science and your role as its protector are closely connected. You care about science not just as a leader but also as someone who loves and understands it deeply. Because of this, I am using the only way I can to thank you for trusting me, hoping it will help this cause.

Just like you honored the first edition of my work, I also dedicate this second edition and all my future writings to you. With great respect, I am your humble and obedient servant, Immanuel Kant.
