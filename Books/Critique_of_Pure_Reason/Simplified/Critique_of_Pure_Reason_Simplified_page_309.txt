There’s something important in how we understand what we see and experience. When we perceive things, all the different parts come together in our mind to form one complete picture. This is what helps us really know objects through our senses, not just notice random sensations.

In real life, these perceptions happen by chance, so there’s no obvious reason why they connect the way they do just from what we sense. When we notice things, it’s like putting pieces next to each other, but this doesn’t show why they should be connected in space and time. 

But since experience means knowing objects through perception, the way these different parts exist has to be understood as happening in time. We can’t actually see time itself, so we figure out how things exist in time by using general ideas that connect these perceptions. These ideas always come with a sense of necessity, meaning experience only works because we imagine these connections have to be there.

Time has three ways it works: things lasting (persistence), things happening one after another (succession), and things happening at the same time (simultaneity). These three ways set rules for how appearances relate to each other in time, and these rules come before any experience and make experience possible.

All of this depends on the fact that our self-awareness stays the same whenever we’re conscious of perceiving something. This self-awareness is the basic reason why all appearances in time come together as one. Our inner sense, which holds all our thoughts and experiences, connects with this self-awareness in a way that comes before experience itself.
