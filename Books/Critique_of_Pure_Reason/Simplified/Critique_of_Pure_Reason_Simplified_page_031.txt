First, Kant criticizes the ontological argument. He says that existence is not a property or a perfection, so it can’t be part of the idea of God or proven just by thinking about God.

Instead, Kant explains that to say something exists, you have to already assume it exists when you make any claim about it. You can’t use existence itself to prove that claim. He also says that even if other arguments could prove a necessary and purposeful being exists (which they can’t), they still wouldn’t prove a perfect God unless the ontological argument worked. Since the ontological argument doesn’t work, trying to prove God’s existence through these ideas is hopeless.

However, the result of Kant’s "Transcendental Dialectic" isn’t all negative. In an appendix, he says traditional ideas in metaphysics can still be useful if we use them in a certain way. Instead of thinking of these ideas as real things to prove, we should see them as goals or guides that help us search for and organize knowledge.

For example, the idea of a simple soul pushes us to study psychology as a whole. The idea of a complete world encourages us to keep expanding scientific research. And the idea of God helps us look for the greatest order and connection in the world, which helps us organize what we learn.

Kant continues this in the "Critique of Judgment," arguing that reason can sometimes mislead us, but if we use it wisely, it’s very helpful and important. His second big idea about reason is that it helps guide our actions, which he starts to explain in the last part of the Critique, called the "Doctrine of Method."

The "Doctrine of Method" is often overlooked because the earlier parts are so long and detailed. But here, Kant talks about how his philosophy compares to other ways of thinking. He looks at the methods of philosophy, mathematics, practical philosophy, and others, explaining their strengths and limits. This part has some very important ideas.
