This idea comes from a moral order that is based on freedom itself, not just rules from outside. It connects the purpose we see in nature to the basic possibilities inside things. This leads to a special kind of theology that uses the idea of the highest perfect being to explain how everything is connected by universal and necessary natural laws, since everything comes from one original necessary being.

What good is our understanding if we don’t set goals for ourselves? The most important goals are moral ones, and only pure reason can help us understand these. But even with this help, we can’t make real use of nature to learn unless nature itself shows a clear purpose. Without this, we wouldn’t have reason because we wouldn’t have anything to learn from or practice with. This clear purpose is necessary and comes from our ability to choose. So, improving our understanding is not the cause but the result of the practical purpose that pure reason gives us.

Looking at the history of human thinking, before moral ideas were clear and organized, knowledge about nature and other sciences only gave us weak and unclear ideas about God. Many people didn’t care much about this question. But as moral ideas became clearer, especially through the pure moral law of our religion, reason started to focus more on this topic. Without more knowledge of nature or perfect insights (which have always been missing), we developed the idea of God that we now accept—not because pure thinking proves it, but because it fits with our moral understanding.
