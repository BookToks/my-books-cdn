This, however, since it arises from moral order as a unity which is grounded in the essence of freedom and not contingently founded through external commands, brings the purposiveness of na­ ture down to grounds that must be inseparably connected a priori to the inner possibility of things, and thereby leads to a transcendental the­ ology that takes the ideal of the highest ontological perfection as a principle a of systematic unity, which connects all things in accordance with universal and necessary laws of nature, since they all have their ori­ gin in the absolute necessity of a single original being.
 
 What sort of use can we make of our understanding, even in regard to experience, if we do not set ends before ourselves? The highest ends, however, are those of morality, and only pure reason can grant us cognition of these. But though equipped and guided with these, we still cannot even make any purposive use of our acquaintanceb with nature for cognitionc unless nature itself has introduced purposive unity; for A 8 171 B 845 without this we would not even have any reason, since we would have no school for it and no culture through objects that would offer the material for such concepts. That purposive unity is necessary, however, and grounded in the essence of the faculty of choice itself, and therefore this one, which contains the condition of the application of that unity in concreto, must also be necessary, and thus the transcendental improvement of our rational cognition is not the cause but rather merely the effect of the practical purposiveness which pure reason imposes on us.
 
 Hence we also find in the history of human reason that before the moral concepts were adequately purified and determined and the systematic unity of purposes was understood in accordance with them and from necessary principles,d the knowledge of nature and even a considerable degree of culture of reason in many other sciences could, on the one hand, produce only rudimentary and vague concepts of the deity, and, on the other, leave a remarkable indifference with regard to this question in general. A greater refinement of moral ideas, which was made necessary by the extremely pure moral law of our religion, made reason attend more sharply to its object by means of the interest that it required reason to take in this object, and, without a contribution from either more ample acquaintance with nature or correct and reliable transcendental insights (which have been lacking at all times), produced ASIS/BS46 a concept of the divine being that we now hold to be correct, not because speculative reason convinces us of its correctness but because it is a Princip b Kenntnis , Erkenntnis d Principien 683 Doctrine of Method.
