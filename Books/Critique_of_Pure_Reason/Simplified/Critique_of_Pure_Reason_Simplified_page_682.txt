So, these kinds of proofs are more like emergency help rather than a perfect way to prove something. But they do have one advantage: a contradiction is easier to understand than a complicated direct proof, making it feel more obvious.

The main reason we use these indirect proofs in different sciences is probably this: sometimes the reasons behind an idea are too many or too hidden. So, we try to find them by looking at what happens because of the idea. 

One way to do this would be to say an idea is true if all its results are true, but this only works if every single result is true. This is impossible because we can’t know all the results of any idea. 

Still, scientists use this method carefully when testing a guess or hypothesis. If many tested results match the guess, they assume the others will too. But because of this, a hypothesis can never become fully proven this way.

However, another method called modus tollens is very strict and easy to use. It says if even one result from an idea is false, then the idea itself is false. So instead of checking all the reasons why an idea might be true, you just need to find one wrong result from its opposite idea to prove the original idea is true.

But this indirect proof only works in sciences where we can’t replace what we think with what’s really out there. When the real thing is most important, it often happens that the opposite of an idea only goes against our way of thinking, not the actual thing. Or sometimes both ideas only clash because of a wrong assumption we mistakenly think is true. In those cases, both ideas could be false, and we can’t say one is true just because the other is false.
