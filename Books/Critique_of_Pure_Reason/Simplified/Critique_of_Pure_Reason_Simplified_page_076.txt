This idea shows that we have to use categories with things we experience in space and time to have a clear consciousness and understand objects. Because of this, concepts only help us know things we can sense, so categories don’t reach beyond what we can experience.

Kant says that even though the concepts of pure understanding apply to all ideas, they don’t actually increase what we can know for sure. But they can still be important in practical ways, especially when we think about freedom.

Kant splits this part of his work into three sections. He says pure reason tends to assume that every knowledge has a cause, and that there must be one final cause that doesn’t depend on anything else. He explains there are three types of reasoning, and for each, reason tries to find an ultimate cause or condition that is unconditioned, meaning it doesn’t rely on anything else.

These three ideas are about the unconditioned mind, the unconditioned reality behind what we see, and the unconditioned cause of everything. Kant says these ideas aren’t actually proven by theory, but they can still be useful in real life.

Kant also says that mistakes in metaphysics come from wrongly thinking that these three ideas are real things. The three main errors are: (1) thinking we truly know the soul just because we relate all thoughts to ourselves; (2) thinking we know the complete nature of space and time or the first cause because we see everything happening in a series; and (3) thinking there is a definite ultimate cause for everything just because we want to explain all possibilities.
