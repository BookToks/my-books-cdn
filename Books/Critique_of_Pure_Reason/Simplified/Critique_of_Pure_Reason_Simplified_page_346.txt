When we understand something through our senses, and then organize those senses using our mind, the thing we think about becomes real to us. If we connect our senses based on ideas, then the thing is necessary—it has to be that way. The rules about how things must be don’t say anything new about the ideas themselves; they just explain how our mind works when we think about them.

In math, a postulate is a basic idea we accept without proof. For example, when we say “draw a circle with a line from a point on a flat surface,” we can’t prove this because it’s how we first create the idea of that circle. We can treat the rules about how things must be in the same way because they don’t add anything new to the ideas; they just show how we combine ideas with our thinking.

When something is real, it’s more than just possible, but not more than what was already possible. Something possible is only an idea in our mind, but when it’s real, it’s connected to what we actually sense.

Kant made notes about how we can know things that are true before experience, like math or logic. He said we always need some kind of tool or example, like a string or movement, to understand these ideas. He also explained that all the rules we come up with only apply to things we can experience, and if we try to go beyond experience, we can’t really understand them.

The rules our mind follows to understand the world don’t tell us everything about specific things, but they explain how we can experience anything at all. These rules come from our own minds, so it makes sense that we can only know them through how we think.

In short, we can’t know any law or rule except through our own mind. For example, chemical laws aren’t absolute laws but just patterns we see in nature.
