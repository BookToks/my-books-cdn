Also, I’m only talking about simple things as they appear inside more complex things, so that the complex things can be broken down into these simple parts.  

The word “simple,” as Leibniz uses it, means something that is given directly as a simple substance (like in self-awareness), not just as a part of a more complex thing, which you might better call an atom.  

Since I only want to prove that simple substances exist as parts of complex things, I could call the opposite idea of the second antinomy a “transcendental atomistic.”  

But this word has already been used to explain physical things (like molecules), which involves real-world ideas, so it’s better to call it the dialectical principle of monadology.
