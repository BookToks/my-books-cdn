Not knowing something can happen in two ways: either I don’t know about certain things, or I don’t know the limits of what I can understand. 

If my not knowing depends on the situation, then in the first case, I should try to learn about those things directly. In the second case, I should try to figure out where my understanding stops. But if my ignorance is absolute and can’t be changed, I can’t just find that out by looking or experimenting. I have to think deeply about where my knowledge comes from. 

So, figuring out the limits of what our mind can understand has to be done based on reasoning before any experience. But realizing that there will always be some things we don’t know can also come from experience, because no matter how much we learn, there’s always more to discover.

The first kind of understanding ignorance comes from examining our own thinking and is like science. The second kind is just noticing what we don’t know from experience, and we can’t be sure how far this ignorance goes. For example, if I imagine the Earth as a flat plate, I don’t know how big it really is. But experience shows me that wherever I go, I can always keep moving further, so I know my current knowledge has limits but not the Earth’s true boundaries.

If I learn that the Earth is actually a sphere, I can use part of its surface, like one degree of the circle, to figure out its size and shape exactly using reasoning. Even if I don’t know everything on Earth’s surface, I at least understand its size and limits clearly.

All the things we can possibly know seem like a flat space with a horizon — the farthest edge we can imagine. This horizon is called the idea of total completeness. We can’t reach this horizon by experience, and all attempts to define it using pure reason have failed. Still, all the big questions our mind asks are about what might be beyond this horizon or at its edge.
