Part I. The Transcendental Aesthetic is about something outside us that we can know before any experience.

You can’t get certain kinds of knowledge just by looking at things like colors or sounds. These are just feelings we have, like seeing colors or hearing sounds, but they don’t give us direct knowledge about the objects themselves, especially not before experience.

This idea is meant to stop people from thinking that things like color or taste are actual qualities of objects. Instead, they are just changes in how we feel, and different people might experience them differently. For example, a rose might seem different in color to different people, but that doesn’t change the rose itself.

The important point is that nothing we see in space is the object itself. Space isn’t a property of the object but just how we organize what we see. We never actually know the “thing in itself” (the object’s true nature), only how it appears to us through our senses.

Second Section: On time.

Time isn’t something we learn from experience. We understand things happening at the same time or one after another because the idea of time is already built into how we think.

Time is a necessary way we have to understand everything we experience. We can’t imagine appearances without time.
