No person is completely uninterested in these questions. Even if someone doesn’t care about being a good person, they can still be afraid that God exists and that there is life after death. This is because no one can be 100% sure that God or an afterlife doesn’t exist. To prove that they don’t exist, you would have to use reason in a way that shows it’s absolutely impossible, and no one can do that for sure. 

This kind of doubt doesn’t make someone good or moral, but it can stop people from doing bad things out of fear.

But is that all reason can do when it helps us think about things beyond what we can see or experience? Just make us believe in these two ideas? You might say even regular people could figure that out without the help of philosophers!

I’m not trying to brag about what philosophy can do by carefully studying human reason, even if it only shows us what we can’t do. I will explain more about this later. But do you really expect that knowledge which applies to everyone should be beyond what normal people can understand and only be explained by philosophers? The very thing you complain about actually proves the points I made earlier. It shows that no one has an unfair advantage when it comes to understanding important parts of human nature. Even the smartest philosophers can’t get much further than what nature has already given regular people as common sense.
