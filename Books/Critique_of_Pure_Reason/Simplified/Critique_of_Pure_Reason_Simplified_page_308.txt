If we think about all the ways our feelings or sensations can change inside us, without paying attention to what kind of feeling it is, it’s interesting to ask how our minds can understand things about what we see or feel before we actually experience them.

The type of feeling, like colors or tastes, always comes from experience and can’t be known beforehand. But the idea of something real that causes these feelings isn’t just nothing. It means something that exists in our mind when we notice it. For example, if you look at a bright surface, it can cause a strong feeling, just like looking at many dimmer surfaces combined. So, we can ignore how big something looks and still feel a change in how strong the sensation is.

All feelings come from experience, but we can understand some parts of them, like how strong they are, without experience. It’s interesting that we can know before experience that things can be continuous or have different levels, but everything else we learn only by experiencing it.

About how we understand time and experience: at first, it was said that all things we see follow rules about how they relate to each other in time. Later, it was explained that experience only happens because our mind connects what we perceive in a certain way. Experience is when we combine what we notice to understand an object or event.
