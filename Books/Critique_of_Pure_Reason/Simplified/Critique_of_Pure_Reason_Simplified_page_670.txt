In the transcendental logic, on the contrary, we have seen that although of course we can never imem diately go beyond the content of the concept which is given to us, nevertheless we can still cog­ nize the law of the connection with other things completely a priori, al­ though in relation to a third thing, namely possible experience, but still a priori. Thus if wax that was previously firm melts, I can cognize a pri­ ori that something must have preceded (e.g., the warmth of the sun) on which this has followed in accordance with a constant law, though with­ out experience, to be sure, I could determinately cognize neither the cause from the effect nor the effect from the cause a priori and without instruction from experience. He therefore falsely inferred from the con­ tingency of our determination in accordance with the law the contin­ gency of the law itself, and he confused going beyond the concept of a thing to possible experience (which takes place a priori and constitutes the objective reality of the concept) with the synthesis of the objects of actual experience, which is of course always empirical; thereby, however, he made a principled of affinity, which has its seat in the understanding and asserts necessary connection, into a rule of association, which is found merely in the imitative imagination and which can present only A 767 / B 795 contingent combinations, not objective ones at all.
 
 The skeptical aberrations of this otherwise extremely acute man, how­ ever, arose primarily from a failing that he had in common with all dog­ matists, namely, that he did not systematically survey all the kinds of a priori synthesis of the understanding. For had he done so, he would have found, not to mention any others here, that e.g., the principle of per­ sistence is one that anticipates experience just as much as that of causality. He would thereby have been able to mark out determinate boundaries for the understanding that expands itself a priori and for pure reason. But since he merely limits our understanding without drawing boundaries for it, and brings about a general distrust but no determinate knowledgeb of the ignorance that is unavoidable for us, by censuring cer­ tain principles of the understanding without placing this understanding in regard to its entire capacityc on the scales of critique, and, while rightly denying to understanding what it really cannot accomplish, goes further, and disputes all its capacityd to expand itself a priori without having as­ sessed this entire capacity, the same thing happens to him that always brings down skepticism, namely, he is himself doubted, for his objections a Princip b Kenntnis , Vermiigen d Vermbgen 657 Doctrine of Method.
