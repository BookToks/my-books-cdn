In transcendental logic, we can’t directly know anything beyond the idea we have, but we can still understand the rules about how things connect before we even experience them. This happens because we relate things to possible experience, even though we don’t need actual experience to know the rules.

For example, if wax that was hard melts, I can know beforehand that something caused it, like the sun’s warmth. But without experience, I can’t exactly figure out what caused what just by thinking about it. Someone mistakenly thought that because we can’t always know the cause and effect perfectly, the rules themselves might not always apply. They mixed up thinking about what could happen before experience with how we actually experience things, which is always based on real life.

This mistake came from confusing how our understanding naturally connects things necessarily with how our imagination just links things randomly. The imagination can only guess at connections, but the understanding knows that some connections must always happen.

The person making these mistakes was very smart but made errors because, like many others, they didn’t look at all the ways our understanding works before experience. If they had, they would have seen that some rules, like things staying the same over time, are just as important and expected as cause and effect.

Because they only pointed out limits without explaining the full power of understanding, they caused people to distrust what we can know, without giving clear answers about what we can’t know. They denied what understanding can’t do but went too far by doubting it can do anything before experience without fully checking.

This caused the problem that happens to all skeptics: people start to doubt the skeptics themselves because their objections don’t fully make sense.
