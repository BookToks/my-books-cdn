When we think about how we perceive things, it’s not always clear if the cause of what we see or feel is inside us or outside us. So, we can’t be sure if what we call "outer perceptions" are just something happening inside our minds, or if they come from real things outside of us. We only guess that these outside things exist, and guesses can be wrong. But the stuff inside us—like our own thoughts and feelings—we know for sure exists because we experience it directly.

An idealist is not someone who says outside things don’t exist. Instead, an idealist says we don’t know for sure that outside things are real because we don’t experience them directly, only through our senses.

Before explaining a tricky mistake people make, it’s important to know there are two types of idealism. One type, called transcendental idealism, says that everything we see or experience is just a kind of mental image or representation, not the actual things themselves. It also says that space and time are just ways our mind organizes what we experience, not things that exist on their own.

The opposite view is transcendental realism. Realists believe space and time exist independently outside of us. They think that objects we see are real things that exist no matter if we sense them or not. But often, these realists end up acting like idealists because they realize our senses alone can’t prove these objects are definitely real.

On the other hand, the transcendental idealist can still believe in the existence of matter and the outside world but only as something that appears to us through our senses. They don’t claim to know anything beyond what we experience in our minds. For them, matter is just a kind of mental representation called an "external" intuition—not because it relates to things that are truly outside, but because these perceptions are ordered in space, which itself is a part of our mind.

In short, the idealist says: "I think, therefore I am," and everything else we perceive is connected to how our mind organizes experience, not necessarily how things really are outside of us.
