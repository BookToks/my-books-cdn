Part of what we think about, especially in math, has always been reliable. This makes us expect other kinds of ideas to be true too, even if they are very different. Also, when we think about things beyond what we’ve experienced, we can’t be proven wrong by experience. The desire to learn more is so strong that we only stop when we find a clear contradiction. But if we are careful with our ideas, we can avoid contradictions, even if our ideas are new and made up.

Math shows us how far we can go just by thinking, without needing to experience things first. It deals with objects and ideas as long as we can picture them in our minds. This is easy to miss because the pictures we create can seem just like pure ideas.

People get excited by how powerful reason is and want to keep expanding their knowledge without limits. Like a bird flying through air and feeling the wind, it might think it could fly even better in space, where there is no air. Similarly, Plato ignored the physical world because it seemed too limited and tried to explore pure ideas in empty space. But he didn’t realize that without any resistance or support, he couldn’t make real progress. 

Human reason often builds its big ideas quickly and only later checks if the base is strong enough. By then, people try to find reasons to believe their ideas are solid or refuse to check at all because it might be risky. What makes us feel confident while building is that most of our thinking is just working with ideas we already have. This gives us many new insights that are really just clearer versions of what we already thought about, not completely new ideas. These insights help us understand our ideas better but don’t change what they mean or add new content.
