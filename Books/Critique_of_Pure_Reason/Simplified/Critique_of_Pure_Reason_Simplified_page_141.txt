If you take away everything we learn through our senses, there are still some basic ideas and judgments we have that must come from somewhere else, not from experience. These ideas help us say more about things we see or feel than just what experience alone can teach us. They also help us make statements that are always true and necessary, which we can’t get just from what we observe.

Even more surprising is that some ideas go beyond anything we could possibly experience. These ideas let us make judgments about things that don’t have any real example in the world around us.

These kinds of ideas, which go beyond what we can sense or experience, are very important for how we think and reason. They are more exciting and meaningful than anything we learn just by observing the world. We are willing to take risks and make mistakes to explore these ideas because they are so valuable, and we would not want to ignore them just because they seem difficult or strange.

It makes sense that once we step away from what we can experience, we shouldn’t just believe in ideas without knowing where they come from or if they are true. We should first ask how our mind can have these ideas without experience, and whether they are really valid and useful. This is a natural question to ask if we think about what should happen. But if we think about what usually happens, it’s not surprising that people have often ignored this question for a long time.

Some of these ideas, like those in math, have long been trusted and proven useful. This makes us hopeful that other kinds of ideas, even if different, might also be trustworthy.

Also, if we go beyond experience, we don’t have to worry about being proven wrong by what we see or sense.
