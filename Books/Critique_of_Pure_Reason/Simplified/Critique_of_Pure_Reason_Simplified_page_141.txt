For if one removes from our experiences every­ thing that belongs to the senses, there still remain certain original concepts and the judgments generated from them, which must have arisen entirely priori, independently of experience, because they a make one able to say more about the objects that appear to the senses than mere experience would teach, or at least make one believe that one can say this, and make assertions contain true universality and strict necessity, the likes of which merely empirical cognition can never afford.
 
 B 6 But what says still more is this, that certain cognitions even aban­ A 3 don the field of all possible experiences, and seem to expand the do­ main of our judgments beyond all bounds of experience through concepts to which no corresponding object at all can be given in expenence.
 
 And precisely in these latter cognitions, which go beyond the world of the senses, where experience can give neither guidance nor correc­ tion, lie the investigations of our reason that we hold to be far more B 7 preeminent in their importance and sublime in their final aim than everything that the understanding can learn in the field of appearances, and on which we would rather venture everything, even at the risk of erring, than give up such important investigations because of any sort of reservation or from contempt and indifference. a Now it may seem natural that as soon as one has abandoned the ter­ rain of experience, one would not immediately erect an edifice with cognitions that one possesses without knowing whence, and on the credit of principles whose origin one does not know, without having first assured oneself of its foundation through careful investigations, thus that one would have long since raised the question how the un­ derstanding could come to all these cognitions priori and what doa A4 main, validity, and value they might have. And in fact nothing is more natural, if one understands by this word that which properly and B 8 reasonably ought to happen; but if one understands by it that which usually happens, then conversely nothing is more natural and compre­ hensible than that this investigation should long have been neglected.
 
 For one part of these cognitions, the mathematical, has long been re­ liable, and thereby gives rise to a favorable expectation about others as well, although these may be of an entirely different nature.
