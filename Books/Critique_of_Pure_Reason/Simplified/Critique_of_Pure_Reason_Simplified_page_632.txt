Critique of all ideas about God that are based only on pure thinking without any experience. If the question is whether this being is a substance, the greatest reality, necessary, and so on, then I say this question doesn’t really mean anything. All the categories I use to try to understand such a being only work when applied to things we can experience, like the world we see and feel. Outside of this, they are just names for ideas that don’t really help us understand anything.

If the question is whether we can at least imagine this being as different from the world by comparing it to things we have experienced, then yes, we can. But only as an idea, not as something real. This idea is like an unknown base that holds together the order and purpose of the world, which reason uses as a rule to study nature. In this idea, we can even think of this being in human terms if it helps us understand the world better, without worrying that it’s wrong.

This idea is just that—an idea. It doesn’t directly describe a being outside the world, but refers to the rule of the world’s unity. We think of it as a supreme intelligence that created the world with wise plans. We shouldn’t try to figure out what this original cause really is, but only how we should use this idea when we study the world with reason.

But some might ask, can we still believe in one wise and all-powerful creator? Absolutely, and we have to. But does this mean we know more than what we can experience? No. We only assume there is something we don’t understand (a “transcendental” object). When we study the world’s order and purpose, we think of this unknown being like an intelligent creator, based on what we know about goals and perfection. We give it the qualities it would need to explain the world’s order, using ideas that fit with how our reason works.
