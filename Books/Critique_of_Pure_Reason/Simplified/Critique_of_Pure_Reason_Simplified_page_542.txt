When we think about how things are divided, we can also apply this idea to a body, which is something we see with clear edges. The way it’s divided is based on space being able to be split up. This makes it possible for the body to be a whole thing that takes up space. The body can be divided into smaller and smaller parts forever, but that doesn’t mean it actually has infinite parts.

It might seem like a body, which exists in space, is different from space itself when we talk about dividing it. Space can be broken down endlessly, but it won’t ever completely disappear because something has to be there. But a substance, which is supposed to be the base of everything that makes it up, should still be there even if you imagine taking away all the parts that make up the body in space. If you take away everything that makes up matter, then nothing should be left. But what we call a substance in how things look isn’t the same as a real thing by itself, which we can understand fully.

The substance we see isn’t something that exists on its own without conditions. It’s just an image or a way we sense things, and it’s nothing absolute or unchanging.

Even though it’s true that you can keep dividing what you see in space forever, this doesn’t work when you think about breaking a whole thing into parts that are already separate and real. If you say that every part of a whole can also be split forever into more parts, and that this goes on without end, this idea doesn’t make sense. The idea that a whole thing is divided into parts forever can’t be thought through clearly, even if parts of matter can be divided endlessly. The reason space can be divided forever is just because it can be split up in general, not because the parts are already decided or fixed. The whole thing isn’t already divided into parts to begin with. So, you can keep dividing it as much as you want.

But if we think about a living body that is made up of parts arranged in a certain way, the whole is already made of separate parts, and it can’t be divided endlessly like space can.
