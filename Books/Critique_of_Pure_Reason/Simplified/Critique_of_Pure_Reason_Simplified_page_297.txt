Almost all laws of nature follow bigger rules of understanding because they apply these bigger rules to specific situations we see. These bigger rules give us a general idea or condition that acts like a formula, while experience shows us the specific example that fits the formula.

There’s little chance someone will mix up rules based only on experience with rules based on pure understanding. That’s because pure understanding uses concepts that are necessary and always true, while experience-based ideas don’t have that kind of certainty, no matter how often they seem to work.

Still, there are pure rules that come from pure intuition (clear ideas we get without experience), not from pure concepts. The understanding works with concepts, so these rules don’t fully belong to pure understanding. Math has rules like this, and applying math to experience depends on pure understanding to make sense and be valid before we even experience anything.

So, I won’t count math’s rules as my main principles. Instead, I’ll focus on the rules that make math’s rules possible and valid. These go from concepts to intuition, not the other way around.

When we use pure concepts of understanding for possible experience, they work in two ways: mathematically or dynamically. Some deal with how we sense things (intuition), and some deal with whether things actually exist. The rules for how we sense things are always necessary for any experience, but the rules about whether objects exist depend on experience and aren’t always necessary.

That means math-based rules are absolutely necessary and certain, while dynamic rules are necessary only when we think about experience, so their certainty is indirect. But they’re still always reliable when related to experience. We’ll understand this better at the end of this system of rules.

The table of categories helps us understand the table of principles because these principles are just rules based on the categories. They act as general guidelines that make the statements in math valid, and these math statements are known to be true before experience, according to the "Transcendental Aesthetic."
