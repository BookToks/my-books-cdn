All attempts by pure reason to go beyond what we can experience only show what we already proved: any conclusions that go past possible experience are misleading and have no real basis. At the same time, this teaches us something important: human reason naturally wants to go beyond these limits. Transcendental ideas are as natural to reason as categories are to understanding. But there’s a difference: categories help us find the truth by matching our ideas with real things, while transcendental ideas cause a strong illusion that tricks us, even when we think very carefully.

Everything about how our mind works should have a purpose and make sense if we use it correctly and avoid misunderstanding. So, transcendental ideas probably have a useful and natural role, even though if we misunderstand them and treat them as real things, they can lead us astray. When it comes to all possible experience, it’s not the idea itself that’s a problem, but how we use it. They can be either excessive (going beyond what’s real) or natural (staying within limits), depending on whether we try to connect them directly to real objects or just use them to help understand things in general. Any mistakes come from bad judgment, not from understanding or reason itself.

Reason never deals with objects directly. Instead, it works through understanding and its practical use, which means it doesn’t create new ideas about objects but only organizes the ones we already have.
