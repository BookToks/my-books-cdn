Pure reason needs a clear idea of something simple to understand it fully, but this clear idea can’t come from any experience or what we see and feel. Since nothing simple is ever given in any experience, and the world we know is made up of all possible experiences, there is no simple thing anywhere in it.

The second part of this idea goes further than the first. The first says simple things don’t exist when we look at something made of parts, but the second says nothing simple exists anywhere in nature at all. This can’t be proved just by thinking about an object we see, but only by thinking about how experience works in general.

Some people called monadists don’t agree with the idea that matter can be divided forever, even though this is supported by math. They don’t trust math as proof about space because they think math is just made-up ideas that don’t relate to real things. It’s like they believe there could be another way of understanding space besides the one we get from our natural sense of it. They say that, besides mathematical points (which are just borders, not parts of space), there could be physical points that are simple and can fill space just by being put together. But many people have clearly shown that this idea is wrong. It’s useless to try to explain away the obvious truth of objects just by using complicated ideas.
