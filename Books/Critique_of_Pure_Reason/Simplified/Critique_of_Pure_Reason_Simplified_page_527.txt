Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter II is not something I know about. But we don’t need to worry about that here. We only focus on how experience grows, where things we see, or appearances, are given to us.

It doesn’t matter if I say that in my experience of space, I might find stars that are a hundred times farther away than the ones I see now, or if I say those stars might exist in the universe even if no one has ever seen them or will ever see them. If those stars existed as things on their own, without any connection to what we can experience, then they would mean nothing to me. So, they wouldn’t be part of what I can experience in a chain of events.

It only matters to make a difference when we use these appearances to think about the idea of the universe as a whole, which goes beyond what we can experience. Then, it’s important to understand how we think about the reality of things we sense, so we don’t get tricked by wrong ideas that can happen if we misunderstand our own thoughts about experience.

The Antinomy of Pure Reason, Section Seven, talks about a big problem in thinking where reason fights with itself.

This problem is based on this idea: If something depends on something else, then the whole chain of everything it depends on must also exist. Since objects we sense depend on other things, this idea leads to many big ideas about the universe that try to explain everything as a complete whole. But this causes reason to get stuck and confused.

Before we explain what’s wrong with this tricky argument, we need to clarify some ideas it uses.

First, one thing is sure: If something depends on something else, then thinking about it means thinking about all the things it depends on, one after another. This is because the idea of depending on something already means there is a connection to a cause or condition, and if that cause also depends on something else, the chain goes on. This idea is clear and not something we should doubt.
