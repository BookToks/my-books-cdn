Kant might be talking about Johann Heinrich Lambert here. Lambert often used the word "postulate" in his philosophy. He was open to accepting postulates if they seemed useful for scientific research. He thought that if something is possible, it can be assumed as true in practical problems. By "practical," he meant experimental, not moral. Even though Kant criticized this idea here, his later use of "postulate" in his practical philosophy might be connected to Lambert’s way of using the term.

Kant also talks about the difference between real and logical opposition. He first introduced this idea in a work where he used the example of motions going in opposite directions. These motions show real opposition, not just logical contradiction. For example, rest is not a contradiction but a real state caused by equal forces pushing opposite ways.

Some ideas from Leibniz that Kant knew about include the Principles of Nature and Grace, Monadology, and the Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence. These works explain some important philosophical ideas that influenced Kant. There is also a famous statement in Discourse on Metaphysics, but Kant did not have access to that one.

Kant also mentions a part of his work called "The Paralogisms of Pure Reason," which talks about certain mistakes in pure reasoning.

Kant often used geographical images in his writing, going back many years. In a series of notes from 1772, he worked out how his philosophy fits into history and system. He started to develop the idea that pure reason is only useful negatively in theory but positively in practice. This chapter’s difference between the negative and positive meanings of the noumenon (thing-in-itself) is an important part of Kant’s argument.

Kant says that the noumenon properly means something that stays the same, which is the object behind what we sense. But it is not a real object we can see or touch; it’s a concept that helps us understand how appearances are unified.

He also refers to a section in his work called the "General Remark on the System of Principles," added later in his writings.

Finally, Kant believed that "pure ideas of reason" are ideas we use to reflect and compare concepts we get through our senses. These ideas don’t directly represent objects but help us understand the rules for how we think about what we experience. This idea goes back to 1769.
