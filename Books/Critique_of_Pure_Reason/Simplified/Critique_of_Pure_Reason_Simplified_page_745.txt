 90 Kant may be referring here to Johann Heinrich Lambert, who made much use of the term "postulate" in his philosophy and was generous in his con­ ception of the grounds on which postulates could be admitted, apparently believing that if a proposition was of use in a scientific inquiry its mere pos­ sibility was adequate for postulating its truth; for example, he writes that "that which, considered in itself, is possible, can be presupposed as a pos­ tulate in a practical problem" (Dianoiologie, § 530, in Neues Organon, oder Gedanken iiber die Erforschung und Bezeichnung des Wahren und dessen Un­ terscheidung vom Irrthum und Schein, vol. I (Leipzig, 1764; in the edition by Gunter Schenk (Berlin: 1990), vol. I, p. 263]). By "practical," here, Lambert means experimental, not moral; but in spite of his criticism in the present context, Kant's later use of "postulate" as a term in his practical philosophy may not be unconnected to Lambert's use of the term.
 
 91 Here again Kant refers to the distinction between real and logical opposi­ tion first introduced in The Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into Philosophy, where the relation between motions in opposite directions is one of his primary examples of real rather than logical oppo­ sition, and where rest is thus treated not as a logical contradiction but as a real state resulting from real opposition between equal motions or forces in opposite directions. See Negative Magnitudes, 2:171-2, 179-80; in Walford, ed., Theoretical Philosophy, I755-I770, pp. 2lI, 218.
 
 92 For statements of this Leibnizian thesis that would have been known to Kant, see P1'inciples of Natul'e and Grace, § 13; Monadology, §§ 78-90; and Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, Leibniz's Fifth Paper, § 87. A classical state­ ment of the doctrine not available to Kant is in Discourse on Metaphysics, § 14.
 
 93 Kant alludes here to the section of the "Transcendental Dialectic" entitled "The Paralogisms of Pure Reason," A 341-404 and B399-432.
 
 Transcendental analytic ("Phenomena and Noumena" and "Amphiboly'') 94 Kant's geographical imagery goes back a long way: see R 4458 (1772, 17:559). This note is found in a series of interesting notes (R 4445-76, 17:552-66), which show Kant working out the situation of his emerging philosophy in both historical (R 4446-51) and systematic (R 4452-76) terms; Kant's mature position that pure reason has only a negative use in the theoretical context and a positive use only in the practical context can already be seen emerging (R 4453,4457,4459). The present chapter's dis­ tinction between negative and positive senses of the concept of the noumenon is an important step in Kant's larger argument for this position.
 
 95 See R 5554 (1778-81, 18:229-30), where Kant writes that "Noumenon properly signifies something which is always the same, namely the tran­ scendental object [OijectJ of sensible intuition. However, it is not a real object [object] or given thing, but rather a concept, in relation to which ap­ pearances have unity" (p. 230).
 
 96 Here Kant refers to B 288-9 in the "General Remark on the System of Principles" added in B.
 
 732 Notes to pages 366-371 97 The view that "pure ideas of reason are ideas of reflection" that "do not represent objects, but only laws for comparing the concepts which are given to us through the senses" goes back to 1769; see R 3917 (17:342-4).
