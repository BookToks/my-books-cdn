If I think about all the knowledge we can get from pure thinking, it’s like a big building that we imagine inside ourselves. In the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements, we looked at the materials to build this building and figured out what kind of structure we could make.  

We wanted to build a tower that could reach the sky, but it turned out we only had enough materials to make a house that’s just big enough for us to live and see the world around us. The big tower idea failed because we didn’t have enough materials, and also because everyone spoke different languages and had different plans, so they ended up building their own small houses instead of one big tower.  

Now, we’re not focusing on the materials but on the plan for the building. We know we can’t try to build something too crazy or beyond what we can do. But we still want to build a strong house that fits what we need, using the materials we do have.  

The Transcendental Doctrine of Method is about figuring out the rules for a complete system of pure thinking. To do this, we’ll look at things like discipline, rules, the overall design, and the history of pure reason. This will help us do what schools tried to do with practical logic but didn’t do very well.  

General logic talks about thinking in all kinds of subjects, not just pure thinking or special topics. So, it can only explain general methods and terms, which help beginners learn the names and ideas they’ll understand better later on.  

People usually don’t like negative judgments because they seem to stop us from learning more. We often see them as enemies of our desire to know everything, and it almost feels like we have to say sorry just for accepting them.
