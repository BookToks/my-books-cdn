We can’t prove the existence of God just by using physical evidence or theology because those proofs only deal with things we can experience with our senses.

The world around us is full of amazing things—there’s so much variety, order, purpose, and beauty, whether we look far into space or closely at tiny details. Even with all the knowledge we have, it’s hard to fully explain or measure everything we see. Our minds can’t even keep up, so in the end, we just feel amazed and speechless.

Everywhere we look, we see a chain of causes and effects, like things happening for a reason. Nothing just appears out of nowhere; everything depends on something else that came before it. If we follow this back endlessly, we end up with a big problem: everything would disappear into nothingness unless we believe there is something that exists on its own, without depending on anything else. This thing supports everything and keeps it going.

This highest cause—how big or powerful is it? We don’t know everything about the world or how to compare it to anything else. But since we need a final cause for everything, why not say it’s perfect beyond anything we can imagine? We can think of this perfect being as one single thing that has all the best qualities combined. This idea fits well with how our minds work, doesn’t contradict what we experience, and helps us make sense of the order and purpose we see in the world.

This kind of proof deserves respect. It’s the oldest and clearest way to think about God that makes sense to most people. It brings meaning and goals to nature, things we wouldn’t have noticed just by watching the world around us.
