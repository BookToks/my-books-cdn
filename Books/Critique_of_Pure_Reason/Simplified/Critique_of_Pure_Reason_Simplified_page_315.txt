It’s not surprising that people believe some ideas just because they feel necessary for understanding the world, even if they haven’t been proven.

A philosopher was once asked how much smoke weighs. He said if you subtract the weight of the ashes left after burning wood from the original wood’s weight, what’s left is the weight of the smoke. This shows he believed that matter never disappears, it just changes form.

The idea “Nothing comes from nothing” comes from the idea that something always stays the same underneath all changes. If the “substance” of something is what lasts through all time, then everything that happens in the past and future must happen in that same substance. So, we only call something a substance if it exists all the time. This idea goes beyond just “persistence,” which usually means continuing into the future—it also means something must have always existed.

The old saying “Nothing comes from nothing, and nothing can go back into nothing” was once seen as one idea but now people sometimes separate them because they misunderstand. Some think these ideas apply to things themselves and worry they go against the idea of a supreme cause of the world. But really, these ideas only apply to what we experience. If new substances could suddenly appear, the unity of time and change wouldn’t make sense. So, “persistence” is just how we understand things existing over time in what we see.

The ways a substance exists are called accidents. These are real because they show how the substance exists. Negations just show what isn’t part of the substance.

If we say an accident like motion belongs to a substance, that’s called “inherence,” while the substance itself is called “subsistence.” But people often misunderstand this difference.
