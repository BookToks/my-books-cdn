Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter II talks about how things come together or break apart, both in big and small ways. This whole process is what we call the world. But when we think of the world as one complete, active system—not just a bunch of things spread out in space and time—we call it nature.

When something happens, the reason why it happens is called the cause. If the cause works freely without being limited, that’s called freedom. But if the cause is limited or controlled, we call it a natural cause. Things that depend on other things are called contingent, while things that don’t depend on anything else are necessary. The kind of necessity that always happens in nature is called natural necessity.

I called the ideas we’re talking about “cosmological ideas” because the word “world” means all the things we can see and experience. These ideas focus on the parts of the world that don’t depend on anything else. Also, in a deeper sense, the word “world” means everything that exists, and we’re trying to understand how all these things connect completely, even if only by looking back at what causes them.

Even though these ideas don’t go beyond what we can experience, they still think about the world in a way that goes beyond what we can actually see or test. That’s why I think it’s okay to call these ideas “world-concepts.”

When we look at the two types of “unconditioned” things—the ones unlimited by math and the ones unlimited by motion or change—I call these the first two world-concepts in a narrower way. “Nature” can mean two things: first, the way something works inside, like the nature of water or fire. Second, “nature” can mean everything we see that’s connected by causes, like the whole system of things around us.
