Outside this area of experience, nothing counts as an object for us. Even questions about things outside this area only deal with ideas about how the mind connects different concepts inside it.

We really do have knowledge that is both new and known before experience, proven by the rules of understanding that come before we even experience anything.

If someone can’t understand how this is possible, they might start to doubt if this knowledge is really in us beforehand. But they can’t say it’s impossible just by using their understanding, or ignore all the steps reason takes following these rules.

They can only say: If we understood where these ideas come from and if they are real, then we could know the limits of our reason. But until then, any claim about reason is just a guess. So, doubting all strict philosophy that ignores questioning reason itself is fair. Still, reason can’t be stopped from moving forward if it builds on a stronger foundation.

All the ideas and questions that pure reason gives us aren’t from experience—they come from reason itself. So, they should be able to be solved or shown to be true or false.

We shouldn’t reject these problems just because we feel we can’t solve them, or assume their answers lie outside us. Reason created these ideas by itself, so it should also explain if they are valid or just tricks.

All the doubt and criticism is really aimed at those who blindly follow their original beliefs without questioning them. The goal is to shake their ideas and help them understand themselves better. This doesn’t settle what we can or can’t know yet.
