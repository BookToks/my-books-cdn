A lot of these ideas were totally new, both for Kant himself and for the history of Western philosophy. Still, the Critique of Pure Reason, along with the other “critical” books that came after it, should be seen as the result of a long process that started at least in 1755. During this time, Kant never fully agreed with the usual Wolffian ideas and kept changing his views and methods until he finished the Critique.

Even after the Critique was first published, Kant’s thinking kept changing. As you’ll see later, there are big differences between the first and second editions of the book (both are fully translated here). In fact, even after the second edition came out, Kant kept improving his ideas and arguments in other works like the Critique of Judgment and in papers he was still writing near the end of his life (later published as the Opus postumum). Also, don’t think that Kant’s mature philosophy, first shown in the Critique of Pure Reason, completely rejects the ideas of those who came before him, especially Leibniz. Instead, Kant’s philosophy tries to combine Leibniz’s idea of a perfect harmony in nature and grace with Newton’s science and the moral and political ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

When Kant criticized the Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy, his main influences weren’t just Hume but also Volff’s religious critic Christian August Crusius. These critics helped Kant change Leibniz’s idea of a world made of monads controlled by God and Rousseau’s idea of a social contract into ideas about human reason. These ideas aren’t things we can prove exist in clear, well-founded knowledge based on human senses and understanding, but they should be seen as important goals for human thinking and behavior, even if we can’t fully reach them.

We can’t explain everything about how Kant’s ideas developed here. But we will quickly talk about some of the works Kant published up to 1770 to show some ideas he included in the Critique of Pure Reason and some he had to reject or change before finishing it. Then, we’ll briefly look at some evidence about how Kant’s ideas grew during the “silent decade” from 1770 to 1781. This talk about how the Critique was created will help us understand what Kant wanted to do and explain some of the complicated parts of the book’s structure and arguments.
