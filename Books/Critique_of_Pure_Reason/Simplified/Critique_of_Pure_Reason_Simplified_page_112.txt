Human reason has a strange problem: it faces questions it can’t ignore because they naturally come up, but it also can’t answer them because they are beyond what humans can understand.

Reason gets stuck through no fault of its own. It starts with basic ideas that are necessary and make sense based on what we experience. Using these ideas, it tries to reach higher and deeper truths. But as it goes further, it realizes it can never finish because the questions keep coming. So, reason tries to rely on ideas that go beyond what we can experience, and these ideas seem so obvious that even common sense agrees with them. But this leads to confusion and contradictions. Reason can guess that it has made some hidden mistakes, but it can’t find them because these ideas go beyond anything we can test or see. This endless struggle is called metaphysics.

There was a time when metaphysics was called the queen of all sciences because it dealt with very important questions. Now, people don’t respect it much anymore. Like a queen who has lost her power, metaphysics is ignored and sad. In the past, metaphysics was controlled by strict rulers, but because their rules were old and harsh, the field fell apart into chaos. Skeptics, who don’t like sticking to any one belief, caused more confusion and broke apart the unity of ideas from time to time.
