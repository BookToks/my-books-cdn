Even though Kant didn’t know about Mendelssohn’s essay beforehand, he was familiar with the ideas Mendelssohn used, which came from Wolff’s philosophy. Kant criticized Wolff’s way of thinking more strongly than ever before and wrote an essay that was completely opposite to Mendelssohn’s.

This essay moves closer to the ideas Kant later explained in the Critique of Pure Reason, but there are still important differences. The biggest change Kant made was about how we know math is certain. Instead of thinking math works by breaking down ideas and checking them with experience, Kant said math uses special definitions that we create ourselves through a process he called "synthesis." Math then builds objects based on these definitions. For example, the idea of a cone in math is made by imagining a right-angled triangle spinning around one side.

Because we create these definitions ourselves, we can be sure they are correct. The objects in math only exist because we build them this way, so we can trust math’s certainty.

Philosophy is different. It doesn’t start with clear, made-up definitions but with confusing ideas that are already given. Full definitions of philosophical ideas, if they come at all, only happen after a lot of thinking. Kant said that defining ideas is not the main goal of philosophy. Instead, philosophy should work like Newton’s science: it should find certainty not by clear definitions but by identifying key features in ideas that lead to true and certain judgments.

This kind of certainty must come from something else, like a clear and obvious inner awareness. Then, we have to carefully study what these clear insights mean. So, while mathematicians create their ideas by putting parts together, philosophers start with unclear ideas and try to find what is definitely true inside them.
