We are not trying to prove that freedom is real or that it causes things to happen in our world. This kind of proof wouldn’t work because we can only understand things based on what we experience. Also, we haven’t tried to prove that freedom is even possible, since just using ideas alone can’t show if there is a real cause or reason for it. Instead, freedom is treated as an idea that helps us think about how things happen in a chain, starting from something that doesn’t depend on anything else. But this idea causes a problem, or contradiction, because our reason follows rules that don’t always fit with what we observe. What we wanted to show was that this contradiction is just an illusion, and that nature doesn’t actually go against the idea of freedom. That was our main goal.

Before, we looked at how things in the world change in a chain, where each thing is caused by another. This chain points us toward something that might be the ultimate cause of everything that can change — a necessary being that exists on its own. Here, we are not talking about causes that never stop, but about something that must exist by itself.

The chain we are talking about is really just a chain of ideas, not things we directly see or experience. One thing is the reason for another in our minds.

It’s clear that since everything we see can change, everything depends on something else to exist. So, there can’t be anything in this chain that exists without depending on something else. If the things we see were the true reality, then there would never be a necessary being at the base of everything.

But this chain of causes has a special feature. Kant says: "Morality is something that, if it’s true, assumes freedom. If that’s true, then freedom must exist."
