When we think about shapes in space, they come from our imagination first. This imagination helps us make images, but these images don’t exactly match the ideas they represent. They only connect through a kind of mental pattern called a schema. 

On the other hand, the schema for a pure idea from understanding can’t be turned into an image at all. Instead, it’s like a rule that combines ideas in a certain way. This rule comes from how our imagination works with time, which is how we organize our inner sense. It helps us put different thoughts together into one clear idea.

Instead of giving a boring explanation of how these mental patterns work, it’s easier to look at them based on different types of ideas, or categories.

For example, when we think about size or amount, space is the pure image for things we see outside ourselves, and time is the pure image for all experiences in general. The schema for understanding size or amount is number. Number shows how we add one thing after another, like counting.

Number is just the way we put together many simple units into one idea, because time itself helps us understand this process. 

Reality means something that causes a sensation or feeling, so the idea of reality points to something that exists in time. Negation means the idea of something that doesn’t exist in time. The difference between these two is like the difference between time that is filled with something and time that is empty.

Since time is just how we experience things, the sensations we get are the real part of objects, the actual stuff behind how they seem to us.
