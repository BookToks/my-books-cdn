The scientists had already made a lot of progress when they figured out that all salts could be grouped into two main types: acidic and alkaline. But they even tried to think of this difference as just two versions of the same basic stuff. They wanted to reduce the many kinds of earth materials (like those that make up stones and metals) down to three types, and finally to two. Still not happy, they guessed that behind all these differences, there might be just one single kind or even one common source for both earths and salts.

You might think this idea is just a way to make things simpler and easier to understand. But it’s more than that—this idea isn’t just a guess; it’s a rule that reason tells us to follow, even if we can’t say exactly where the limits of this unity are.

If what we see around us was so different— not just in shape but in what they really are— that even the smartest people couldn’t find any similarities, then the idea of grouping things into categories (genera) wouldn’t work at all. In that case, we wouldn’t have any general ideas or understanding, because understanding depends on these concepts.

So, the rule of grouping things into categories assumes that there is some sameness in the many things we can experience, even if we can’t know exactly how much. Without this, we couldn’t form ideas based on experience or have experience at all.

But while the rule about categories expects things to be the same in some way, there is another rule about species that says we need to notice differences and variety too. This rule tells us to pay attention to what makes things different, not just what makes them the same.

These two rules show that reason wants two things that sometimes clash: on one hand, it wants to see the big picture and group things together; on the other hand, it wants to focus on the details and differences.
