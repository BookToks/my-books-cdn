When we think about time, it’s not about things we actually know by themselves, but just about how things relate to each other. For example, where something is (place), how it moves (motion), and the rules that control this movement (forces). But what’s really inside a place, or what happens in things besides moving around, isn’t shown by these relationships.

Because we only get these kinds of relationships through our senses, we never really know the thing itself, only how it appears to us. So, when we see or sense something outside ourselves, we only get a kind of connection between the thing and us, not what the thing really is inside.

The same goes for our inner sense, or how we feel things inside. It’s not just about the things we sense outside, but also about the time we put those feelings into. Time comes before we even notice those feelings and helps us organize them. Time is about how things happen one after another, at the same time, or last for a while.

Because what we sense first is just a kind of “picture” in our mind, and these pictures are only about relationships, time is like a way our mind organizes these pictures. It doesn’t tell us anything by itself, but it shows how our mind is affected by its own activity—how it puts these pictures together inside us. This is what we call inner sense, but only in the way it works, not what it actually is.

Everything we sense is just an appearance, not the real thing itself. So, our inner sense can’t give us the real “self,” only how the self appears to us. It’s tricky to understand how we can really know ourselves inside, and this is a problem for all ideas about self-awareness.

Being aware of ourselves (consciousness) is just knowing “I am,” but if everything inside us came only from this awareness, then our inner sense would be like pure thinking or intellect. For humans, though, being aware of ourselves means also sensing the different parts inside us that are already there. Since this awareness isn’t completely active or creative, we call it sensibility, meaning it depends on receiving information.

If our mind wants to understand what’s inside itself, it has to work with this kind of inner sensing, which is different from pure thinking or self-creation.
