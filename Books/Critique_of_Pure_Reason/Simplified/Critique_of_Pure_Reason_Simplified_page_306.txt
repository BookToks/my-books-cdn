If we want to explain how things change from one state to another, it’s not easy to prove this clearly using just pure logic because understanding causes of change depends on real-life experiences. Our brain doesn’t naturally know that something can cause a change from one state to the opposite state without learning it from experience. This is because changes only happen in certain ways we see around us, and only experience can teach us about those changes. But since we are only using basic ideas that come from all possible experiences without adding anything real or physical, we can’t predict all of natural science, which is based on actual experiences, without messing up the whole system. Still, there is strong proof that our principle helps us guess what we will see and stops us from making wrong conclusions when we don’t have all the facts.

If everything we see has a certain amount of reality, and between full reality and no reality there are many smaller steps, and if every sense can only feel things to a certain level, then it’s impossible to have a perception or experience that shows a complete absence of anything real, like empty space or empty time. First, you can’t actually see a total lack of reality, and second, you can’t figure it out from any one thing you see or from how real it looks. Even if a space or time feels completely real, since reality can get smaller and smaller in endless steps while the size or length of the space or time stays the same, there must be many different levels of how full that space or time is. Also, the amount of reality in different things can be more or less even if they take up the same amount of space or time.

Here’s an example. Most natural scientists notice big differences in how much matter is in the same amount of space. They see this partly because of weight or gravity, and partly because of how much something resists being moved by something else.
