When we think about how things happen in nature, some people wonder if freedom can really exist or if everything is just decided by natural laws. Many believe that what we see and experience are the real things themselves, but this idea can confuse us. If what we see is actually all there is, then everything must happen because of nature’s rules, leaving no room for freedom.

But if what we see is just how things appear to us—not the things themselves—then there must be something deeper that causes these appearances. This deeper cause isn’t controlled by what we see, even though its effects show up in what we experience. So, this cause exists outside the natural chain of events.

Because of this, an effect can be free when linked to this deeper cause, but still follow natural laws in what we observe. This idea might seem complicated, but it helps explain how freedom and nature can both be true. If we only believe appearances are real, then freedom would not exist, and that’s why many people struggle to connect nature and freedom.

Now, think about a cause that is free but also follows natural laws. I call this kind of cause “intelligible,” meaning it’s not something we can see or sense directly.

If something we see has, inside it, a power that isn’t visible but can cause what we do see, then we can think about its cause in two ways: as an invisible thing causing effects, and as the effects we observe. We can understand this power both by experience and by thinking, and both ways explain the same effect.
