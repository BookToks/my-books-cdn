The problem with pure reason is that it makes us try to find the cause of things by going back further and further in a chain of causes. Every cause depends on something else before it. But this way of thinking promises that all our experiences will be connected and follow clear rules. On the other hand, the idea of freedom offers a break from this chain by suggesting there is a cause that starts by itself. But since this cause doesn’t follow the usual rules, it breaks the connection that lets us understand everything clearly.

The person who believes nature controls everything might argue against the idea of freedom like this. If you don’t assume that the world started at a specific time, then you don’t need to look for a first cause in the chain of events. Who told you to imagine a very first moment in time when everything began? Since things in the world have always existed—at least, that’s what our experience suggests—it’s okay to think that their changes have always been happening too. So, there might not be a first cause or a first moment in time.

We can’t really understand if it’s possible to have an endless chain with no first part. But if you don’t accept this mystery, then you’ll have to give up on some basic ideas, like the powers that things have or even the idea that things can change. Because if you didn’t see from experience that change really happens, you wouldn’t be able to imagine how something can keep going through being and not-being without stopping.
