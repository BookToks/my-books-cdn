Transcendental philosophy is just an idea for now. The Critique of Pure Reason is supposed to show the whole plan clearly, based on principles, and make sure everything in it is complete and certain. This critique isn’t called transcendental philosophy itself because to be a full system, it would have to analyze all human knowledge from the start.

Our critique gives a full list of all the basic ideas that make up pure knowledge. But it doesn’t fully analyze these ideas or all the ones that come from them. This is because such an analysis wouldn’t help with the main problem the critique is trying to solve, and it would also make the plan less focused. We can leave that deeper analysis for later, as long as we have the main principles ready and nothing important is missing.

Everything that makes up transcendental philosophy is part of the Critique of Pure Reason. It shows the full idea of transcendental philosophy, but it isn’t the science itself yet, because it only analyzes what is needed to understand synthetic a priori knowledge completely.

The goal is that no ideas based on experience should be included, so the knowledge must be completely pure. Even though important moral principles and ideas are a priori (known before experience), they don’t belong in transcendental philosophy because feelings like pleasure, desires, and choices are not part of it.
