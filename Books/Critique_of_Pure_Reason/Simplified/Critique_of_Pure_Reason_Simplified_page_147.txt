Division of Transcendental Philosophy" Transcendental philosophy is here only an idea,b for which the cri­ tique of pure reason is to outline the entire plan architectonically, i.e., from principles,' with a full guarantee for the completeness and cer­ tainty of all the components that comprise this edifice.d That this cri­ tique is not itself already called transcendental philosophy rests solely on the fact that in order to be a complete system it would also have to contain an exhaustive analysis of all of human cognition priori. Now a our critique must, to be sure, lay before us a complete enumeration of all of the ancestral conceptse that comprise the pure cogni;:ion in ques­ tion. Only it properly refrains from the exhaustive analysis of these con­ cepts themselves as well as from the complete review of all of those derived from them, partly because this analysis would not be purposeAI4/BZ8 full since it does not contain the difficulty that is encountered in the synthesis on account of which the whole critique is actually undertaken, partly because it would be contrary to the unity of the plan to take on responsibility for the completeness of such an analysis and derivation, from which one could after all be relieved given one's aim. This com­ pleteness of the analysis as well as the derivation from the priori con­ a cepts which are to be provided in the future will nevertheless be easy to complete as long as they are present as exhaustive principle� of synthe­ sis, and if nothing is lacking in them in regard to this essential aim.
 
 To the critique of pure reason there accordingly belongs everything that constitutes transcendental philosophy, and it is the complete idea of transcendental philosophy, but is not yet this science itself, since it goes only so far in the analysis as is requisite for the complete estima­ tion of synthetic priori cognition.
 
 a The chief target in the division of such a science is that absolutely no concepts must enter into it that contain anything empirical, or that the priori cognition be entirely pure.

 The words "here only an idea" are replaced in the second edition with "the idea of a sci­ b ence"; see 27 below.
