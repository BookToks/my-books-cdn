Here’s an experiment that checks if our first idea about how we understand things is true. That idea says that our thinking only reaches what appears to us, not things as they really are by themselves, which we can’t fully know.

What makes us want to look beyond what we experience is something called the “unconditioned.” Reason wants to find this unconditioned in things themselves because everything we see has conditions that lead up to it. If we assume that what we know from experience matches things as they really are, then the unconditioned can’t be thought about without problems. But if we assume that what we see is just how things appear to us, and not how they really are, then these problems go away. This means the unconditioned isn’t in the things we know directly but in things as they are on their own, which we don’t know. This shows our first idea was actually right.

Since pure thinking can’t help us know things beyond experience, we should try to see if practical reason—how we act and make decisions—can help us understand the unconditioned, going past what we can experience, like metaphysics hopes to do. Even though pure thinking leaves this area empty, reason asks us to fill it using practical ideas if we can.

This experiment is like a chemistry test where they break things down and then put them back together. At first, the philosopher separated pure knowledge into two parts: things as they appear and things as they really are. Now, reason tries to combine them using the idea of the unconditioned and finds that it only works if we keep the difference between appearance and reality. This difference is the real truth.
