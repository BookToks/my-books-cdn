But herein lies just the experiment providing a checkupu on the truth of the result of that first assessment of our rational cognition a priori, namely that such cognition reaches appearances only, leaving the thini' in itself as something actual for itself but uncognized by us.
 
 For that which necessarily drives us to go beyond the boundaries of ex­ perience and all appearances is the unconditioned, which reason nec­ essarily and with every right demands in things in themselves for everything that is conditioned, thereby demanding the series of condi­ tions as something completed. Now if we find that on the assumption that our cognition from experience conforms to the objects as things in themselves, the unconditioned cannot be thought at all without con­ tradiction, but that on the contrary, if we assume that our representa­ tion of things as they are given to us does not conform to these things as they are in themselves but rather that these objects as appearances conform to our way of representing, then the contradiction disap­ pears; and consequently that the unconditioned must not be presentC in things insofar as we are acquainted with them (insofar as they are given to us), but rather in things insofar as we are not acquainted with them, as thingsd in themselves: then this would show that what we initially asBXXl sumed only as an experiment is well grounded.* Now after speculative reason has been denied all advance in this field of the supersensible, what still remains for us is to try whether there are not data in reason's practical data for determining that transcendent rational concept of the unconditioned, in such a way as to reach beyond the boundaries of all possible experience, in accordance with the wishes of metaphysics, cog­ nitions a priori that are possible, but only from a practical standpoint. By * This experiment of pure reason has much in common with what the chemists sometimes call the experiment of reduction, or more generally the synthetic procedure. The analysis of the metaphysician separated pure a priori knowledge into two very heterogeneous elements, namely those of the things as appearances and the things in themselves. The dialectic once again combines them, in unison with the necessary rational idea of the uncondi­ tioned, and finds that the unison will never come about except through that distinction, which is therefore the true one.
