This is just the logical way of assuming all the facts needed to reach a conclusion, and there’s no idea of time involved when connecting the condition and what depends on it; both are assumed to happen at the same time. Also, it’s natural (in the smaller statement) to think of what we see as real things by themselves and as things understood just by thinking, like in the bigger statement where I ignored all the ways we sense things, which is how objects can be given to us.

But here, we missed an important difference between the ideas. Putting together the thing that depends on another and all the conditions (in the bigger statement) doesn’t involve time or a sequence. But the real-life process, and the series of conditions in what we see (which are part of the smaller statement), always happen one after another in time. So, I couldn’t assume the whole series all at once here like I did before because before, all parts of the series exist by themselves without time, but now they only exist by going back step by step, which you can only do by actually completing that process.

When this mistake is shown to be the basis of common arguments (about big ideas like the universe), both sides’ demands can be rejected since they have no solid reason. But that doesn’t stop their fight or prove that one side is definitely wrong, even if they can’t make good arguments. It seems obvious that if one person says the world had a beginning and the other says it’s always existed, one of them must be right. But since both sides have equal proof, we can’t ever know who’s right, so the argument keeps going, even though reason tells them to stop. So, the only way to end this fight fairly is if they realize they’re arguing about something that doesn’t really exist, and their minds are tricking them into seeing a problem where there isn’t one.

This is the approach we will now take to settle a debate that can’t be decided for good.
