Everything is about things starting and stopping, and both have reasons.

All the things we see together make up the world and belong to real objects (not just ideas). God, as a cause, is not part of the world. Only when what we perceive matches real objects do our perceptions make sense and fit together.

Kant talks about two opposing ideas called "antitheses": for the first idea, the opposite is "There is no substance," and for the second, "There would be no first cause." Kant isnâ€™t very clear about why these ideas clash, but it seems to be about how space and time go on forever and how our understanding works.

In the next note, Kant explains where these conflicts come from and hints that his whole book could be built around this. He says, "The rules that make experience possible also make the things we experience possible." He then divides these rules into two groups: (1) rules about how we see things, or "appearance," and (2) rules about how experiences happen, or how things actually exist.

Kant explains that the conflicts happen because we get one set of rules from using reason based on experience, where space and time are seen as how things appear, and another set from pure reason, where space and time are not just conditions of how we think.

From this, Kant describes two groups of opposing ideas that lead to conflicts he talks about in his book: 

The first group, based on experience, says:  
1. There is no limit to how things come together or break apart.  
2. There is no first beginning.  
3. Everything changes and is uncertain because time is necessary, but nothing must always be linked to time.

The second group, based on pure reason, says:  
1. There is a first simple part that starts everything, and there are limits to everything we see.  
2. There is complete freedom beyond experience.  
3. There is something necessary in itself, a highest unity that sets limits on all possibilities.

The first pair of ideas debate whether space and time are infinite or not. The second pair argue whether everything has a cause or if there is a first cause without a cause before it. The third pair discuss if everything that happens is random or if there is a necessary reason behind it all.
