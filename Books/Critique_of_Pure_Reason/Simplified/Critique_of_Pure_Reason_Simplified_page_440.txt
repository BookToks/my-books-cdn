About the mistakes of pure reason

We already said we believe in something called transcendental idealism. This means we don’t have to doubt that matter exists just because we are aware of ourselves. It’s like how we know we exist as thinking people. I know I have thoughts, so those thoughts exist, and I exist as the one having them.

But things outside of me, like objects, are just appearances. They are a kind of my own thoughts or representations. These objects only exist because I think about them, and they don’t exist separately from my thoughts. So, both the things outside me and myself exist, and I know this right away because I’m aware of myself.

The difference is that when I think about myself, it’s related to my inner senses (my mind), but when I think about objects, they are related to my outer senses (like sight or touch). I don’t need to guess or prove that objects outside me are real any more than I need to prove my own thoughts are real. Both are just representations, and being aware of them is proof they are real.

So, someone who believes in transcendental idealism also believes in empirical realism. This means they accept that matter, as it appears to us, is real and can be directly experienced. On the other hand, transcendental realism has problems because it thinks objects outside us are totally separate from our senses and exist on their own. This makes it hard to be sure that just because we see or think about something, it really exists outside of us. But in our view, things like matter are just representations in us, and we are directly aware of their reality.

Most psychologists who support empirical idealism also believe in transcendental realism. They take empirical idealism seriously because it’s a tricky problem that reason struggles with. If you think objects outside us cause our perceptions, then we can only guess if those objects really exist or if the cause is inside us. This makes it hard to be sure about anything outside our own minds.
