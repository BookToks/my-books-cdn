Luckily, there were only a few people causing trouble, so they couldn’t stop the dogmatists from always trying to rebuild their ideas, even though they never agreed on a plan. Not long ago, it even seemed like all these arguments would end, and the truth about all the competing ideas would be decided by a study of how people understand things (by the famous Locke). But it turned out that even though this supposed queen’s origin was traced back to simple experience, making her claims seem suspicious, she still kept insisting she was right. This happened because her background story was actually false. So, metaphysics went back to the same old confusing dogmatism and stayed in the bad reputation it was supposed to escape from.

Now, after trying many ways without success, people feel bored and don’t really care anymore. This boredom and indifference cause chaos and confusion in science, but at the same time, it’s the beginning of change and new understanding. When people try too hard and get things wrong, science can become unclear and useless.

It’s pointless to pretend not to care about these questions because they matter a lot to human nature. Even when people try to sound casual and avoid school-like language, these so-called indifferent people end up making metaphysical claims anyway, even though they say they don’t like them. Still, this indifference happens while all other sciences are doing well, and it focuses on the sciences whose results we actually need the most. This is something worth thinking about. It’s not because our time is careless, but because people’s judgment has matured and won’t settle for fake knowledge anymore.

Sometimes people say our time’s thinking is shallow and that good science is dying. But I don’t think this is true for sciences like math and physics, which still have strong foundations and even get better. This same spirit could help other areas of knowledge if they fixed their basic ideas first. Without this, feelings of indifference, doubt, and strict criticism actually show that people are thinking well. Our time is really the age of criticism, where we demand that reason takes on its toughest job: understanding itself. It’s like a court where reason checks its own claims and gets rid of false ones, not by force but by its own unchanging rules. This court is what we call the critique of pure reason.
