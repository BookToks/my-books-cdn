Chapter 1, Section 3 is based only on facts that can change, not on rules that force someone to give up making strong claims.

Also, because he doesn’t understand the difference between real knowledge from understanding and the fake claims of reason, which he mainly attacks, reason itself isn’t really stopped—just slowed down. Reason still feels like it can grow and, even if it gets annoyed sometimes, it won’t stop trying. It’s ready to defend itself and keeps pushing to meet its goals. But once it fully understands what it can really do, and knows it has some certain knowledge, even if bigger claims turn out to be false, it stops arguing and is happy with the smaller, sure things it has.

For people who don’t think carefully and don’t know the limits of their understanding, and so don’t know what they can really know but try to find out just by trying things, these skeptical attacks aren’t just risky—they can be really harmful. If they can’t explain or prove one idea with good reasons, then people start doubting all their ideas, no matter how convincing those ideas seem.

So, the skeptic is like a strict teacher for those who make strong but careless claims, helping them think more carefully about understanding and reason. Once someone gets this far, they don’t have to worry about more challenges, because they can tell what they really know from what’s outside their knowledge, and they don’t claim or argue about what they don’t understand. Even though being skeptical isn’t totally satisfying when asking big questions, it helps by making reason more careful and showing it how to protect what it really knows.

First Chapter, Third Section: The rules for pure reason when it comes to guesses.

Since, after checking our reason carefully, we know we really can’t know anything for sure just by guessing or thinking alone, shouldn’t the rules for pure reason allow even more room for guesses, since at least reason is allowed to imagine and have opinions, even if it can’t be sure?
