The first five paragraphs of this part are loosely based on a work called Prolegomena, but unlike the earlier paragraphs about math, they are not copied directly from it.

In his book Treatise of Human Nature, Hume argues that the ideas most important to geometry—like equality, inequality, straight lines, and flat surfaces—are not exact or clear. He says these ideas come only from our senses and imagination, so it doesn't make sense to talk about any perfect versions beyond what we can sense or imagine. This means he doesn’t believe in pure math, which is exactly what Kant thought his "sound understanding" would have stopped him from saying. Kant didn’t seem to know about Hume’s view that math is based on experience and has limits because Hume didn’t repeat this idea in another book called the Enquiry. This shows that Kant probably hadn’t read most of Hume’s Treatise, which wasn’t translated into German until the 1790s.

Kant first started to separate math and philosophy in a book written in 1762 and published in 1764. Then, in his first big academic paper in 1770, he clearly explained the difference between two ways we know things: through our senses and through our intellect. In that paper, Kant said space and time are necessary for us to sense the outside world and our inner self. So, space and time are about how things appear to us, not how things really are in themselves. He also began to argue that space and time are built-in ways we understand things before we experience them. But Kant didn’t start calling this idea the "Transcendental Aesthetic" (the study of how we sense things) until a few years after 1770.

The word "aesthetic" was already used to mean the "philosophy of feeling or sensing" as early as 1769. But the phrase "transcendental aesthetic" appears for the first time in notes Kant wrote between 1772 and 1776. Other important early mentions of this idea come from Kant’s notes in 1774 and drafts for his big Critique book. In these drafts, Kant talks about the "Transcendental Aesthetic" as part of a bigger theory about how things appear to us and how we experience them. He also uses terms like "Transcendental Theory of Experience" and "Dialectic of Sensibility" to describe parts of this idea. Elsewhere, Kant says an intuition is the direct way our mind connects to a specific object.
