2 I The first five paragraphs of this section are loosely based on Prolegomena, § 5 (2:275-80), but, unlike the preceding paragraphs on mathematics, not directly copied from it.
 
 22 In the Treatise of Human Nature, Hume does argue that "the ideas which are most essential to geometry, viz. those of equality and inequality, of a right line and a plain surface, are far from being exact and determinate . . . As the ultimate standard of these figures is deriv'd from nothing but the senses and imagination, 'tis absurd to talk of any perfection beyond what these faculties can judge of . . ." (book I, part II, section IV; in the edition by L. A. Selby-Bigge, revised by Ph. H. Nidditch [Oxford, 1978], pp.
 
 50-I). In other words, he here denies the possibility of pure mathematics, precisely what Kant supposes his "sound understanding" would have pre­ vented him from doing. Kant's ignorance of Hume's assertion of the em­ pirical foundation and limitation of mathematics in the Treatise, which is not repeated in the first Enquiry, is good evidence for the traditional as­ sumption that Kant had no firsthand acquaintance with most of the Treatise, which was not translated into German until I79!.

 Transcendental aesthetic I After having begun to distinguish the methods of mathematics and philoso­ phy in the Inquiry concerning the distinctness of the principles of natural theology and morality written in 1762 and published in 1764, Kant first publicly dis­ tinguishes between the cognitive faculties of sensibility and intellect in his inaugural dissertation, "On the form and principles of the sensible and in­ telligible world," defended and published in 1770. His argument there an­ ticipates the argument of the present section of the Critique that space and time are the necessary conditions of outer and inner sense, and as such are principles of "phenomena" or things as they appear rather than of "nou­ mena" or things as they are in themselves (§ 13, 2:398). The detailed argu­ ments that space and time are a priori forms of intuition are anticipated in §§ 14 and IS of the inaugural dissertation (2:399-405), However, Kant did not begin to use the name "Transcendental Aesthetic" as his term for the sci­ ence of the a priori conditions of sensibility until several years after 1770.
 
 The term "aesthetic" is used as the designation for the "philosophy of sen­ sibility" as early as I769 in R 1584 (16:25), butthe term "transcendental aes­ thetic" seems to appear first in R 4643 (17:622-3), a note ascribed to the period 1772-76. Other important anticipations of the "Transcendental Aesthetic" include R 4673, notes Kant made on a letter dated 28 April 1774 (1]:636-42), and the loose sheet R 4756 (17:699-703), an important draft of an outline for the emerging Critique in which Kant deals with the matter of the "Transcendental Aesthetic" under the rubric of a "Transcendental Theory of Appearance," and also heads other sections of his outline as a "Transcendental Theory of Experience" and a "Dialectic of Sensibility." 2 Elsewhere, Kant defines an intuition as the "immediate relation of the 719 1 Notes to pages 155-159 power of representation to an individual object" (R 5643, 1780-88, 18:282).
