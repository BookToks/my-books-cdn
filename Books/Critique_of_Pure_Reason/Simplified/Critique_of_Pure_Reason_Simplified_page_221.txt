Part II, Division 1, Book 1, Chapter 1 says that my idea only means the soul is one thing among countless things that stay after you take away everything that can die.

But the huge range of what’s possible only gets smaller because we take out what can die, and the soul fits into what’s left. Even with this rule, what’s left is still endless, and you could remove more parts without changing what we mean by the soul.

So, in terms of logic, this huge idea just limits what we can know a bit. We shouldn’t leave this out when we think about all the moments of thinking in judgments, because the way our mind works here might be important when we think about things before experience.

All the ways we connect ideas in judgments are: a) how the predicate relates to the subject, b) how the reason relates to the result, and c) how the thing we’re dividing connects to all the parts it’s split into.

In the first kind of judgment, only two ideas are connected. In the second, two judgments are linked. In the third, several judgments relate to each other.

For example, the hypothetical statement "If there is perfect justice, then stubborn evil will be punished" connects two ideas: "There is perfect justice" and "Stubborn evil is punished." We don’t know if these ideas are true by themselves here; only their connection matters.

Finally, a disjunctive judgment connects two or more ideas not in order, but as opposites. One idea’s area excludes the others, but they also work together to cover all possibilities. For example, "The world exists either by blind chance, by inner necessity, or by an outside cause." Each idea covers part of what’s possible about how the world exists, and together they cover all options.

Taking one option away means putting the idea into one of the other areas.
