The pure categories don’t really help on their own because they don’t have a clear or specific object to apply to. This means that pure categories alone can’t give us any certain knowledge about things before we experience them. The rules of understanding only work when we use our experiences, not beyond what we can possibly experience.

So, it’s better to say that pure categories only have meaning when we think about how we sense things, but they can’t be used on their own to know anything for sure. Without connecting them to our senses, they don’t help us understand or think about any object at all. They are just the basic way our mind organizes thoughts about things in general, but they can’t actually tell us anything about real objects by themselves.

Kant added notes to explain this more: You can only understand if something is possible through sensing it, either from experience or some kind of intuition. Both relate to things we can appear to us. We can’t really know things beyond what we can sense, but we can think about them in a practical way related to ourselves.

If something doesn’t fit the laws of the sensible world, like cause and effect, it belongs to a different realm. We don’t really know ourselves in that realm, but we can imagine it might exist. Beings that only exist in understanding would need a special kind of knowing that humans don’t have because we can’t directly sense things with just our mind.

So, categories are just ways of thinking. If you try to use them alone without any example from what you can actually sense, they don’t make sense. Things that can’t be sensed are either part of what we experience or not, but since we don’t have this special kind of mental sensing, we can’t really understand things that aren’t connected to our senses. Those things remain just ideas or problems we can’t solve.
