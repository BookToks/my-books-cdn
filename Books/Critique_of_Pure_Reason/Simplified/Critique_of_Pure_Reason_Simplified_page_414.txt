When we talk about "absolute," it usually means something that is true about a thing by itself, without thinking about anything else.

So, if we say something is "absolutely possible," it means it can happen on its own, which is the smallest thing we can say about how possible something is.

But sometimes, "absolute" means something is true in every way, no matter the situation (like absolute power). In this case, "absolutely possible" means it can happen in all situations, which is the biggest claim we can make about possibility.

Sometimes these two ideas are the same. For example, if something is impossible by itself, it’s also impossible in every way, so it’s absolutely impossible.

But most of the time, these two ideas are very different. Just because something can happen on its own doesn’t mean it can happen in every situation. Later, I will explain that absolute necessity (something that must be true) doesn’t always depend on what’s true inside itself, so you shouldn’t think absolute means the same as just internal.

If the opposite of something is impossible by itself and impossible in every way, then that thing is absolutely necessary. But you can’t always say that if something is absolutely necessary, its opposite is impossible by itself. Sometimes "internal necessity" is a useless idea that doesn’t help us understand anything. Instead, thinking of necessity as something true in every situation has special meaning.

Philosophers care a lot about keeping these ideas clear because they are important in deep thinking.

I will use the word "absolute" this way: to mean something true without any limits, compared to something that’s only true in some cases, which is limited.

A big idea in reason is that it always looks for the complete total of conditions and never stops until it finds something that is not limited by anything else.

Reason leaves to understanding everything connected to actual things we can imagine. Reason only focuses on the complete total when using ideas and tries to connect everything together in a unified way.
