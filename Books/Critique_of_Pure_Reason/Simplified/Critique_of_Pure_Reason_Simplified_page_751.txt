He finally outlines the critique of rational psychology at R 5553 (1778-79, 18:221-9 at pp. 227-8).
 
 23 Compare Kant's account of the "subreption of the power of judgment" at R 5059 (1776-78, 18:75). The foundation ofWolffian rational psychology was the doctrine of the soul as a "monad" or simple substance (Baumgarten, Metaphysica §§ 4°2-5,742,755). Compare also Leibniz, Principles of Nature and Grace §§ 1-2. Leibniz, Die philosophische Schriften, ed. C. ]. Gerhardt (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1875-90),6:509-606. (References to Leibniz will be to the Gerhardt edition, cited either by section [§} number within a given work or by volume:page.) 24 Here Kant refers to the arguments for the soul's simplicity put forward in the Wolffian tradition. The simplicity of the soul was also central to its claim to immortality, since natural perishability was taken to consist in the dissolution of a composite. See Wolff, Psychologia rationalis § 3, Gesammelte Werke (Hildesheim: Olms, 1972) II.6; Baumgarten, Metaphysica §§ 745-7, 756-7. At this point vVolff and Baumgarten were following Leibniz, Mo­ nadology (6:607-23) §§ 1-6, 14. But Adickes and Kemp Smith (A Commen­ tary to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason [New York: Humanities, 1962], pp. 458-9) have argued that Kant was thinking of the arguments used by Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786) in his dialogue Phiidon (1767), Gesam­ melte Schrifte. Jubilaumsausgabe. (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1932) 3:69-73.

 26 Important discussions of the immortality of the soul include R 4238-40 (1769-70, 17:472-5) and Metaphysik Mrongovius, 29:910-20.
 
 2 7 For a precursor of Kant's sense of "person" here, see Leibniz, New Essays Concerning Human Understanding, preface G 6:58, and James Beattie, An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, chapter II, section 2 (Edin­ burgh: WIlliam Creech, 1776), p. 50. Because the German translation of the latter work was the source for Kant's knowledge of Hume's views about the self, he can be presumed to be familiar with this passage. A clear state­ ment of the paralogism here analyzed can be found at R 4933 (1776-78, 18:32). R 5646 (1785-88, 18:295) suggests that only morality can provide a secure basis for identity of the self. The most famous modern discussion of personal identity was John Locke, Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690), ed. P. Nidditch (Oxford: Clarendon, 1975) Book II, ch. 27, §§ 9-29, pp. 335-48. Locke held that personal identity depends on "sameness of consciousness," but distinguished this from sameness of substance. A purer example of the position Kant is criticizing is articulated by Leibniz in his discussion of Locke in the New Essays on Human Understanding (first pub­ lished in 1765). Leibniz agrees with Locke that "consciousness or the sense of I proves moral or personal identity," but criticizes Locke for holding that it proves only "apparent identity" and thinking that "apparent identity could be preserved in the absence of any real identity," i.e. identity of sub­ stance (Leibniz, New Essays on Human Unde1�ftanding, G 6:236). Leibniz in­ sists that immaterial beings or spirits necessarily perceive their existence 738 Notes to pages 422-436 through time and hence that the memory which provides an epistemic guarantee of personal identity also provides a guarantee of substantial identity as well.
