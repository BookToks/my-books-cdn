He finally explains the problems with rational psychology in R 5553 (1778-79, 18:221-9 at pp. 227-8).

Compare this with Kant’s idea of the "subreption of the power of judgment" at R 5059 (1776-78, 18:75). The main idea behind Wolffian rational psychology was that the soul is a "monad" or a simple, indivisible thing (Baumgarten, Metaphysica §§ 4°2-5,742,755). Also compare Leibniz’s Principles of Nature and Grace §§ 1-2. References to Leibniz come from the Gerhardt edition, either by section number or volume and page.

Here, Kant talks about the arguments for the soul’s simplicity used by Wolff’s tradition. The idea that the soul is simple was important because it supported the idea that the soul doesn’t die. People thought things that are made of parts can break down and die, but something simple can’t. See Wolff, Psychologia rationalis § 3, and Baumgarten, Metaphysica §§ 745-7, 756-7. At this point, Wolff and Baumgarten were following Leibniz’s Monadology (§§ 1-6, 14). But some scholars like Adickes and Kemp Smith think Kant was also thinking about the arguments from Moses Mendelssohn’s dialogue Phædon (1767).

See note 40 below.

For other versions of this argument, see R 4234 (1769-70? 17:470-1) and Metaphysik Mrongovius, 29:905.

Important talks about the soul’s immortality include R 4238-40 (1769-70, 17:472-5) and Metaphysik Mrongovius, 29:910-20.

For an early idea of what Kant means by "person," see Leibniz’s New Essays Concerning Human Understanding, preface G 6:58, and James Beattie’s Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, chapter II, section 2 (Edinburgh: William Creech, 1776), p. 50. Since the German translation of Beattie’s work introduced Kant to Hume’s ideas about the self, Kant probably knew this passage well. A clear example of the mistake Kant is pointing out can be found at R 4933 (1776-78, 18:32). R 5646 (1785-88, 18:295) suggests that only morality can give a solid basis for knowing who you really are.

The most famous modern discussion of personal identity was by John Locke in his Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690). Locke said personal identity depends on "sameness of consciousness," but he said this is different from sameness of substance. Leibniz gave a clearer example of the idea Kant criticizes in his New Essays on Human Understanding (first published 1765). Leibniz agreed with Locke that "consciousness or the sense of I proves moral or personal identity," but he criticized Locke for thinking it only shows "apparent identity" and that this could exist without real identity, meaning the same substance. Leibniz said that spirits or immaterial beings always know they exist through time, so the memory that proves personal identity also proves real identity of substance.
