The first type of tricky reasoning dealt with the idea that the mind or soul is a single, unchanging thing behind all our thoughts. This matches a kind of logical argument called a categorical syllogism, where one statement relates something to a subject. 

The second type of tricky argument is similar to another kind of logic called hypothetical syllogisms. It focuses on the idea that there is one ultimate cause or condition behind what we see. The third type, which will be explained next, is about the idea that there is one ultimate cause behind the possibility of all objects.

It's interesting that the first kind of mistake, called transcendental paralogism, only creates a one-sided false idea about the subject of our thoughts. There is no good reason to believe the opposite idea from pure reasoning. 

This mistake supports the idea of a soul or spirit, even though this idea has a big problem: when carefully tested, it loses all its strength and becomes unclear. 

Things are different when we use reason to understand how appearances come together. Here, reason tries to prove its idea of one ultimate unity, and it seems believable at first. But soon, it turns out to be only an illusion.
