The first species of these sophistical inferences had to do with the unconditioned unity of the subjective conditions of all representations in general (of the subject or the soul), corresponding to the categorical syllogisms, whose major premise, as a principle, a states the relation of a predicate to a subject. Thus the sec- B433 ond species of dialectical argument, by analogy with hypothetical syl­ logisms, will make the unconditioned unity of objective conditions in appearance its content, just as the third species, which will come forward in the following chapter, has as its theme the unconditioned unity of objective conditions of the possibility of objects in general.
 
 It is remarkable, however, that the transcendental paralogism effects a merely one-sided illusion regarding the idea of the subject of our thought, and for the opposite assertion there is not the least plausibili­ tyb forthcoming from concepts of reason. The advantage is entirely on the side of pneumatism, even though pneumatism cannot deny that rad­ ical defect through which its entire plausibility dissolves into mere haze when put to the fiery test of critique.45 It turns out wholly otherwise when we apply reason to the objective synthesis of appearances, where reason thinks to make its principlec of A407 unconditioned unity valid with much plausibility;d but it soon finds ita Princip b Schein , Principium d mit vie/em Scheine zwar 459 Doctrine of Elements.
