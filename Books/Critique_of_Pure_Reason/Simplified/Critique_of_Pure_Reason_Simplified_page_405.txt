When we make a judgment, it’s like putting together a conclusion based on a rule that covers many cases. This rule itself can be questioned, so we have to keep looking for the reason behind the reason, going deeper each time. The main goal of reason is to find the ultimate cause or explanation that doesn’t depend on anything else, so everything fits together perfectly.

But this idea only works if we believe that when we see something with a condition, the whole chain of conditions behind it is also there. This chain should end in an unchanging, final cause that is part of the object itself.

This main idea of reason is different from normal logic because it’s not just about obvious facts. The condition and what causes it are connected clearly, but the ultimate cause is not obvious. We need new ideas to understand the unchanging cause, and these ideas go beyond what we usually learn from experience.

The principles that come from this big idea of reason don’t apply to things we can see or experience directly. They are different from the rules we use to understand the world around us. We don’t know for sure if this idea about an ultimate cause is actually true or if it just helps us think better by pushing us to find deeper explanations.

Sometimes, people mistake this need to find a final cause as proof that such a cause really exists in the world. This can lead to wrong ideas and mistakes in reasoning because it assumes things about the world that we can’t prove. Our next step is to explore these mistakes and misunderstandings to understand how human reason works and where it can go wrong.
