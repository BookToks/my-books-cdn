The Akademie edition of Kant's works (from 1900 onward) will be cited using volume and page numbers in parentheses. In these notes, "R" means Kant's Refelxionen, which are his handwritten notes found in volumes 14-19 of the Akademie edition edited by Erich Adickes and Friedrich Berger between 1911 and 1934. Unless said otherwise, all translations are our own. References to the Critique of Pure Reason will use page numbers from the first ("A") or second ("B") edition, which you can see in the margins of this translation. The current citation is at 5:151.

For a simple overview of the philosophies of Wolff and Baumgarten, check out Lewis White Beck's book Early German Philosophy: Kant and his Predecessors (Harvard University Press, 1969), especially chapters 11 and 12, pages 256-296. To learn about how Wolffianism lasted and reacted to Kant, read Frederick C. Beiser’s The Fate of Reason (Harvard University Press, 1987), chapter 7, pages 193-225.

In the 20th century, many people thought Hume wasn’t really a skeptic. Instead, he used skepticism about old metaphysics to explain human beliefs in a natural way. For this, see Norman Kemp Smith’s The Philosophy of David Hume (Macmillan, 1941) and Barry Stroud’s Hume (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1977).

For info on both Locke’s and popular philosophers—who sometimes overlapped—see Beiser’s The Fate of Reason, chapter 6, pages 165-192. To learn about how Thomas Reid’s “common sense” philosophy influenced Germany during Kant’s time, see Manfred Kuehn’s Scottish Common Sense in Germany, 1768-1800 (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1987).

To use a metaphor from Lewis White Beck, see his article "Kant's Strategy" in Essays on Kant and Hume (Yale University Press, 1978), pages 3-19.
