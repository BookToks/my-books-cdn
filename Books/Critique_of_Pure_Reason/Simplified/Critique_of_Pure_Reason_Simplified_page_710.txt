We have to admit that it’s still hard to clearly separate the two parts of how we think. One part we can understand completely on its own, without any experience, but the other part we only learn from experience. Even experts have trouble making this clear. Because of this, people have never really figured out the exact limits of a special kind of knowledge, or the true idea of a science that human reason has tried to understand for a long time.

When people say metaphysics is the science of the basic principles of human knowledge, they don’t really mean a special kind of knowledge. They just mean it’s more general, but this doesn’t clearly separate it from knowledge based on experience. Even in knowledge from experience, some ideas are more general and higher than others. So, if you don’t clearly separate what can be known without experience and what can only be known from experience, how do you decide where to draw the line? It’s like trying to divide history into the “first centuries” and the rest, and then wondering if the 5th or 10th century are part of the first ones.

You might ask, “Does the idea of something that takes up space belong to metaphysics?” The answer is yes. What about the idea of a body? Also yes. But what about the idea of a liquid body? Then it gets confusing. If you keep going like this, everything would belong to metaphysics. This shows that just because something is more general or part of a bigger idea, it doesn’t mean we can decide the limits of a science. Instead, what really matters is that the ideas come from completely different places. 

Another reason metaphysics has been confusing is because it seems similar to math, since both come from knowledge that doesn’t depend on experience. But metaphysics is about ideas, while math is about building and judging ideas in a different way. This difference has always been felt but never clearly explained. Because of these problems, philosophers have made mistakes in understanding their own science. Without a clear plan or direction, their work has been uncertain and confusing.
