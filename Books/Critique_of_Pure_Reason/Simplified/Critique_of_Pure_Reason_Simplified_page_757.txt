This argument is very similar to the first parts of Leibniz's Monadology. He says, "1. A monad is a simple substance that makes up bigger things – simple means it has no parts. 2. There have to be simple substances because bigger things are just collections of simples" (Leibniz, Monadology §§ 1-2).

This idea probably includes Leibniz (as mentioned before) and the Wolffians (see Baumgarten, Metaphysica §§ 230-45, 396-405). It might also apply to the view in Theoria philosophiae naturalis (Vienna, 1758) by the Jesuit Rudjer Boscovic (1711-1787). But the idea criticized here seems closest to what Kant himself believed in his Physical Monadology of 1756 (1:473-88; see also Metaphysical First Grounds of Natural Science, 4:504).

The word "monad" had been used earlier by Henry More (1614-1687). But Leibniz probably got it mostly from More's student Lady Anne (Finch), Viscountess Conway (1631-1679). Leibniz knew her ideas through her doctor and writer, Francis Mercurius van Helmont (1614-1698), who also wrote to Leibniz.

Many thoughts focus especially on the third antinomy. These include notes R 3922 (1767), R 3976 (1769), R 4225-7 (1769-70), R 4338 (1770-71), R 4723 (1773-75), R 5413 (1776-78), R 5612-19 (1778-79), R 5829 (1783-84), R 5964 (1783-84), R 5972 (1780s), and R 5976-8 (1783-84).

The most famous idea about a first mover comes from Aristotle (Physics, book 8; Metaphysics, book 12). You can also check Baumgarten, Metaphysica § 300.

Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairan (1678-1771) took over as head of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris in 1740 and stayed until he died. He wrote about many topics in physics and natural science, like his Dissertation on Ice (1715), a study on the Northern Lights (1733), a paper on the force of moving bodies (1741), and a Letter to Mme Chatelet about living forces (1741). Mairan also published lots of papers in important science journals, which he helped edit. According to Ferdinand Alquie, Kant’s referenced treatise was published in 1747, but we couldn’t confirm this.

One of the first ideas to link theoretical claims with practical reason comes from note R 5109 (1776-78).

Kant disagrees with Plato and Epicurus again about what knowledge is about (A853-4/B881-2). See also Logic, 9:29-30.

J. H. Lambert (1728-1777) wrote a "Memoir to the Berlin Academy on Transcendental Magnitudes" in 1768, found in his collection Beitrage zum Gebrauch der Mathematik und deren Anwendung (1766-72).
