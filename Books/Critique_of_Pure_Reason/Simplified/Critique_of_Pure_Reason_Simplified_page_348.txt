When we understand things, we don’t just use ideas or concepts alone; we need actual experiences or examples. For example, the statement "Everything that can happen must have a cause" makes sense to most people. But this only works if you already think of "things that can happen" as things that depend on something else. Then the statement becomes like saying "If something depends on something else, it has a cause," which is obvious.

When we talk about things that can change or happen by chance, we usually think about changes or events, not just the idea that something could be different. Changes happen only because something causes them, so the fact that something depends on a cause shows it is not necessary but contingent (meaning it could be different).

It’s even more interesting that to really understand how things can happen according to certain rules, we don’t just need ideas, but real, outside experiences. For example, to understand the idea of something that stays the same (like a solid object), we need to imagine it in space because space is constant. Time, on the other hand, keeps moving and changing, so it can’t give us the same feeling of something lasting.

To understand changes and causes, we need to think about motion, which is change in space. Motion helps us see how changes happen because just thinking about them doesn’t explain how they work.

Also, just because we can imagine something not existing (like matter), it doesn’t mean it really depends on something else. For example, just because a body moves and then stops doesn’t mean its motion is random or caused by nothing. To prove motion depends on a cause, you have to show that the body could have been still before moving, not just that it stops afterward. Otherwise, the two ideas (moving and resting) don’t really oppose each other in a way that proves anything.
