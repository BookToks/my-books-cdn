If imagination is not just to excite us but, under careful control of reason, is to create something new, then first we must be completely sure that the thing is possible and not just made up or an opinion. In that case, it’s okay to rely on an opinion about whether the thing is real, but this opinion must be connected to something that is actually given and certain. Then it’s called a hypothesis.

Since we can’t figure out from scratch the idea of how things are connected in cause and effect, and the way we understand things only helps us understand what we see in experience, we cannot just make up a new object with properties we’ve never seen before and base a hypothesis on it. Doing this would be like building ideas on empty imagination instead of real concepts.

So, we are not allowed to imagine new original forces, like a mind that understands things without using the senses, or a force that attracts without touching, or a new kind of stuff that exists in space but can be passed through. Also, we can’t think of groups of substances that are different from anything experience shows us—no things outside space, no time except what we experience. In short, our reason can only use the conditions of possible experience as the conditions for the possibility of things. It cannot create new ones outside these conditions, because ideas like that, even if they don’t contradict themselves, would have no real object.

The ideas of reason, as we said, are just ideas and don’t have any object in experience. But that doesn’t mean they are made-up objects that are assumed to be possible. They are only thought about as problems to help guide how we use understanding in experience, like useful fictions. If you ignore this, they become just made-up things with no real meaning.
