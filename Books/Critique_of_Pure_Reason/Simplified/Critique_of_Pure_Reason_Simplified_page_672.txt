If the imagination is not simply to enthuse but is, under the strict A nO/ B 798 oversight of reason, to invent,b something must always first be fully certain and not invented,c or a mere opinion, and that is the possibility of the object itself. In that case it is permissible to take refuge in opinion concerning the actuality of the object, which opinion, however, in order not to be groundless, must be connected as a ground of explanation with that which is actually given and consequently certain, and it is then called an hypothesis.20 Now since we cannot construct a priori the least concept of the pos­ sibility of dynamical connection, and the category of the pure under­ standing does not serve for thinking up such a thing but only for understanding it where it is encountered in experience, we cannot orig­ inally cook up,d in accordance with these categories, a single object with any new and not empirically given property and ground a permissible hypothesis on it; for this would be to found reason on empty figments of the brain rather than concepts of things. Thus we are not allowed to think up any sort of new original forces, e.g., an understanding that is capable of intuiting its object without sense or an attractive force with­ out any contact, or a new kind of substance, e.g., one which would be present in space without impenetrability; consequently we also cannot conceive of any community of substances that would be different from A n I / B 799 anything that experience provides;2I no presence except in space, no duration except merely in time. In a word: it is only possible for our reason to use the conditions of possible experience as conditions of the possibility of things; but it is by no means possible for it as it were to create new ones, independent of these conditions, for concepts of this sort, although free of contradiction, would nevertheless also be without any object.
 
 The concepts of reason are, as we have said, mere ideas, and of course have no object in any sort of experience, but also do not on that account designate objects that are inventede and at the same time thereby as­ sumed to be possible. They are merely thought problematically, in order to ground regulative principles! of the systematic use of the un­ derstanding in the field of experience in relation to them (as heuristic fictions). If one departs from this, they are mere thought-entities, the a dichten b dichten c' erdichtet d aussinnen , gedichtete f Principien 659 Doctrine of Method.
