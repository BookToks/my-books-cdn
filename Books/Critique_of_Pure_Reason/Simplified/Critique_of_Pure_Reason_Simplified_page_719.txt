David H. Chandler wrote a book published in Zurich and New York in 1994.

Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten wrote some important works about poetry and philosophy between 1735 and 1758. You can find these texts in collections edited by Heinz Paetzold and Hans Rudolf Schweizer, both published in 1983.

Kant made a note critiquing Baumgarten but later changed his mind after 1787. He decided there was a basic principle for judging taste. In his 1790 book, Critique of Judgment, he called these judgments "aesthetic judgments," which became the main way philosophers talked about beauty in nature and art.

Tonelli wrote about these ideas on page 6.

Kant used an old distinction found in books like Georg Friedrich Meier’s from 1752. He talked about this in his logic lectures, which were published later by Gottlob Benjamin Jäsche in 1800.

Tonelli also explains where these terms came from.

John Locke’s Essay concerning Human Understanding, especially book 1 chapters 2 to 4, is important for understanding these ideas.

About 100 years ago, Hans Vaihinger wrote a big commentary of 1,066 pages just about the introduction and a part of Kant’s Critique. It was published between 1881 and 1892.

The famous argument between Leibniz and Samuel Clarke happened around 1716-1717. Their letters were published by Clarke after Leibniz died, and you can find them in a book edited by H. G. Alexander.

More recent ideas about Kant’s philosophy come from Henry E. Allison and Paul Guyer, who wrote important books in the 1980s.

Early critics of Kant’s ideas included Fichte and Hegel. A modern critical book was written by J. F. Bennett in 1966. More recent defenses come from Beatrice Longuenesse and Reinhard Brandt.

Paul Guyer also wrote about the complicated parts of Kant’s "Transcendental Deduction" in a book he edited.
