Part II, Division II, Book I explains that things have original causes, and only when everything in the world comes together as a whole does it match its true idea. If we ignore the complicated way this is said, the philosopher’s deep thinking—looking at physical things and then understanding how they connect based on ideas—is something to respect and try to follow.

When it comes to things like morals, laws, and religion, ideas make it possible to experience what is good, even if we can never fully show it in real life. These ideas do an important job that many people don’t notice because they judge them by rules based on experience. But these rules should actually be ignored when it comes to ideas.

It’s wrong to make rules about what we should do just by looking at what people actually do or to limit rules to that.

Instead of focusing on those big ideas, we’re going to do a less flashy but still useful job: making the ground steady and strong enough so these big moral ideas can be built on. Under this ground, there are all kinds of hidden tunnels, like ones moles dig, leftover from reason’s past mistakes in searching for treasure. These tunnels make any building unstable.

We need to understand better how pure reason works, its principles and ideas, so we can judge its influence and value correctly. Before finishing this introduction, I ask anyone who cares about philosophy (which is more than most people think) to be careful with the word “idea.” Don’t let it lose its original meaning by mixing it up with other words that describe different kinds of mental images. We already have enough proper words for each type of mental picture, so there’s no need for one word to take over another’s meaning.

Here’s how they are organized: The biggest group is representation in general. Under that is representation with consciousness, called perception. If a perception is about the subject’s changed state, it is a sensation. An objective perception is...
