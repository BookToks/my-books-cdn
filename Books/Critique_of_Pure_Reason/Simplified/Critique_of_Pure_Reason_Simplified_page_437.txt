Some old ideas say that everything changes and nothing in the world stays the same forever. But this idea doesn’t work if you believe in things called substances, or things that really exist on their own. Still, we can’t prove if our soul stays the same over time just because we feel like it does.

When we think about ourselves, we assume we’re the same person throughout the time we’re aware of. But from someone else’s point of view, we can’t be sure this “I” is the same all the time. The “I” is just a thought that links all our other thoughts together, and it might change just like everything else.

It’s interesting that we have to prove the idea of personality and the soul’s lasting nature only now. If we just assumed these things, then it would mean not that our consciousness lasts nonstop, but that it can keep coming back in the same person. That would be enough to show personality exists, because a person doesn’t disappear just because they stop being aware for a while.

This lasting nature doesn’t come from anything before we realize we are the same “I” over time. Instead, we figure it out from this idea of being the same self. If we did this properly, we’d first understand the idea of substance, which we can only really use when dealing with real-world experiences. But since the idea that the “I” is the same in all our thoughts doesn’t actually prove the soul lasts, we can’t say the soul is a real lasting thing just based on that.

Still, the idea of personality, like the ideas of substance and being simple, can be helpful. It’s a way to think about ourselves as one whole thing, even if we don’t really know what that is exactly. This idea is enough for practical use, but it doesn’t give us true knowledge of ourselves just by thinking about it. The idea of the “same self” just goes in circles and doesn’t answer deeper questions.

What something really is in itself, beyond how we see it, is completely unknown to us. But we can observe its lasting nature as long as we think about it as part of ourselves.
