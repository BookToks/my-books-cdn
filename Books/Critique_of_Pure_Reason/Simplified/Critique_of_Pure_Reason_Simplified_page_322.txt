We first learn about all the rules we use to organize our experiences through this process. Of course, understanding these rules clearly, like how one thing causes another, only happens because we have used them in real life. But thinking about these rules as the reason why we can connect things that happen over time actually came before any experience we had.

It's important to show with an example that even when we experience something, we don't just say the order of events happens because of the object itself. Instead, we notice the order because a rule forces us to see things in that way, not in a random order. This rule is what lets us understand that the events really happen in that order in the object.

We have ideas in our minds that we can be aware of. But no matter how clearly we think about them, they are still just ideas inside us, arranged in a certain time order. So how do we decide that there is a real object behind these ideas? Saying that an idea is connected to another idea (which we call the object) doesn't explain how it becomes real outside our mind. 

If we look closely at what makes our ideas connected to an object and why that connection matters, we see that it only means our ideas have to follow a certain rule and order. In other words, ideas get their real meaning only because they happen in a certain necessary order over time.

When we put together all the different things we see or experience, the ideas always come one after another. But just because they come in order doesn’t mean we’re thinking about an object yet. That’s because this order happens in every experience and doesn’t make one thing different from another. But once I realize or expect that this order has a special relation to an object...
