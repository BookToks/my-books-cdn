30).
 
 35 There are numerous texts bearing on the argument oft his section. First of all, see the Jasche Logic, introduction section IX (Lectures on Logic, pp.
 
 570-88); then see R 2450 and 2451 (1764-68, 16:373-5), R 2452 and 2454 (1769-70, 16:375-6), R 2457-62 (1770-75, 16:377-81), R 2477 (1780s, 16:387), R 2479-80 (1780s, 16:388), R 2486 (1780s, 16:389), R 2492 (1780s, 16:392-3), R 2493 (1790s, 16:393), R 2793 (1790S, 16:513-15), and R 5645 (1785-88? 1780-84? 18:287-95).
 
 36 In a number of notes, Kant makes clear that practical believing cannot be equated with theoretical belief in a mere probability: see R 6108-10 (178389, 18:456-8), R 6280 (1785-88, 18:546-8), and R 2495 (1790S, 16:393-4)' 37 Here Kant presumably alludes to Pascal's wager; see his Pensies, nos. 223, 418 (Lafuma numbering).
 
 38 See R 2630 (1780s, 16:443), R 2692 (1780s, 16=472), R 2714 (1773-76, 16:480-1), and R 2793 (1790s, 16:513-15).
 
 39 I.e., spontaneous generation; here Kant is again using a biological theory that still retained credence for his simile.
 
 40 The ensuing conception of historical cognition, together with the claim that someone may have only historical cognition of a rational body of truths if he himself has only learned it from another, derives from Wolff; see Discursus praeliminaris de philosophia in genere (1728), e.g., §§ 3, 8, 22-4; translation by Richard]. Blackwell, Preliminary Discourse on Philosophy in General (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1963), pp. 3, 5, 13-14.
 
 41 By this Kant means the first chapter of the "Doctrine of Method," i.e., the "Discipline of Pure Reason." 42 Here Kant is obviously alluding to Plato's theory of mathematical learning in the Meno (82b-86a), although of course he has replaced Plato's theory of recollection with his own view that the source of mathematical knowl­ edge is a priori intuition.
 
 43 In Emile, book III, Rousseau argues that the child learns philosophy best by solving practical tasks and not by being glued to books (in the transla­ tion by Allan Bloom [New York: Basic Books, 1979], p. 177)' Perhaps Kant had this thought in mind in the present paragraph.
 
 44 For the classical formulation of this characterization of metaphysics, see Aristotle, Metaphysics, I (A), 1 (98 I b2 5-982 a2); Kant himself characterized the subject-matter of metaphysics in these terms in A New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition of 1755 (1:387); in Theoretical Philosophy, I755-I770, p. 5.
 
 45 Here Kant again seems to have Wolff in mind, who sometimes suggests that philosophical knowledge is just more general than specific historical knowledge; see Discursus praeliminaris, § 43; Blad..'W ell, pp. 26-7· 46 Here Kant is referring to the Wolffian distinction between ontology or general metaphysics as the general science of what is possible, i.e., the cat­ egories of things, and special metaphysics or rational theology, cosmology, and psychology, as the most general science of what actually exists. See Discursus praeliminaris, § 29; Blackwell, p. 17· 755 Notes to pages 698-703 47 Here Kant is referring to the Wolffian distinction between rational cos­ mology and rational theology.
