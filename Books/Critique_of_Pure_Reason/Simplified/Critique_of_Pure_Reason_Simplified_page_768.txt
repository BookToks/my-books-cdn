There are many texts related to the ideas in this section. First, check the Jasche Logic, introduction section IX (Lectures on Logic, pages 570-88). Then look at R 2450 and 2451 (1764-68, 16:373-5), R 2452 and 2454 (1769-70, 16:375-6), R 2457-62 (1770-75, 16:377-81), R 2477 (1780s, 16:387), R 2479-80 (1780s, 16:388), R 2486 (1780s, 16:389), R 2492 (1780s, 16:392-3), R 2493 (1790s, 16:393), R 2793 (1790s, 16:513-15), and R 5645 (1785-88? 1780-84? 18:287-95).

Kant says in several notes that practical belief isn’t the same as just thinking something is probably true. See R 6108-10 (1783-89, 18:456-8), R 6280 (1785-88, 18:546-8), and R 2495 (1790s, 16:393-4). 

Here, Kant is likely talking about Pascal’s wager; see his Pensées, numbers 223 and 418.

Also, look at R 2630 (1780s, 16:443), R 2692 (1780s, 16:472), R 2714 (1773-76, 16:480-1), and R 2793 (1790s, 16:513-15).

When Kant mentions spontaneous generation, he is using an old biological idea that people still believed in back then.

The idea of historical knowledge, and that someone only truly knows a set of ideas if they learned them from someone else, comes from Wolff. See Discursus praeliminaris de philosophia in genere (1728), especially sections 3, 8, and 22-24. There is a translation by Richard J. Blackwell called Preliminary Discourse on Philosophy in General (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1963), pages 3, 5, and 13-14.

By this, Kant means the first chapter of the "Doctrine of Method," which is called the "Discipline of Pure Reason."

Here, Kant is clearly referring to Plato’s idea about learning math from the Meno (82b-86a). But instead of Plato’s idea about remembering knowledge, Kant thinks math knowledge comes from intuition we have before experience.

In Emile, book III, Rousseau says kids learn philosophy best by doing real tasks, not just reading books (in the translation by Allan Bloom, New York: Basic Books, 1979, page 177). Maybe Kant had this idea here too.

For the classic way of describing metaphysics, see Aristotle, Metaphysics, I(A), 1 (981b25-982a2). Kant himself described metaphysics like this in A New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition (1755), page 387; and in Theoretical Philosophy, 1755-1770, page 5.

Kant seems to think about Wolff here, who sometimes said philosophical knowledge is just more general than specific historical knowledge. See Discursus praeliminaris, section 43; Blackwell, pages 26-27.

Kant is talking about Wolff’s idea that ontology or general metaphysics studies what is possible, like categories of things, while special metaphysics or rational theology, cosmology, and psychology study what actually exists. See Discursus praeliminaris, section 29; Blackwell, page 17.

Here, Kant refers to Wolff’s distinction between rational cosmology and rational theology.
