The understanding connects things to what we can sense, but this “something” is only the idea of an object in a very general way. We don’t really know what this “something” is, and we probably never can, because our minds work in a certain way. It’s just a way to link all the different parts we sense into one idea of an object.

This “transcendental object” can’t be separated from what we sense, because if it was, there would be nothing left to think about. So, it’s not an object we can really know by itself. It’s just how we think about appearances as objects in general, based on the different things we sense. That’s why the categories (ways we organize our thoughts) don’t stand for any specific object by themselves. Instead, they help us understand this general idea of an object by using what we sense, so we can know things based on appearances.

But sometimes, what we sense isn’t enough. We have to think about something beyond what we can sense, which only our pure understanding can imagine. Sensibility (our ability to sense) and what we see or feel are limited because they only show us how things appear to us, not how things really are. This was explained earlier when we talked about how appearances work. Since appearances can’t exist on their own without someone to experience them, there must be something behind the appearances that isn’t itself an appearance. This something is an object that exists independently of how we sense it.

From this, we get the idea of a “noumenon,” which is this thing that exists independently of our senses, even though we can’t directly experience or know it the same way we know appearances.
