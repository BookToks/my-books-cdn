Zeno the Eleatic, a clever thinker, was criticized by Plato because he liked to prove something with good arguments and then quickly prove the opposite with just as strong arguments. He said that God (which he probably meant as the world) is not finite or infinite, not moving or still, and not like or unlike anything else.

People thought this was nonsense because it seemed like he was denying two opposite ideas at the same time. But I don’t think this is a fair criticism. I will explain the first idea soon. If by God he meant the universe, then he had to say it is neither staying in one place nor moving, because places exist only inside the universe, so the universe itself isn’t in any place. Also, if the world contains everything, it can’t be like or unlike anything else because there’s nothing outside it to compare with.

If two opposite statements depend on a condition that can’t be true, then both statements fail, even if they seem to contradict each other. 

For example, if someone says every object either smells good or doesn’t smell good, there’s a third option: an object might have no smell at all. So both opposite statements can be false. If I say an object either smells good or doesn’t, these two statements truly oppose each other, and only the first is false. But the second includes things that don’t smell at all. In the first case, the condition (having a smell) was not fully considered, so the statements weren’t true opposites.

Similarly, if I say the world is either infinite or not infinite, and the first is false, then the second must be true. This only rules out an infinite world, without saying the world has to be finite. But if I say the world is either infinite or finite, then both could be false because I’m assuming the world’s size is fixed, which might not be right.
