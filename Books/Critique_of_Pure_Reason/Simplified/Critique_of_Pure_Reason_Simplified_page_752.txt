Awareness of the substantial continuity of oneself is for him so immediate that doubting the veracity of memory regarding it would be tantamount to skepticism about every matter of fact, a doubt so extreme as to render skepticism itself pointless (Leibniz, New Essays on Human Understanding 6:238-9). Baumgarten presents two accounts of personal identity, the first grounding it on "intellectual memory" (Metaphysica § 641), the second on free will (Metaphysica § 756).
 
 28 See the related argument at R 5650 (1785-89, 18:298-302).
 
 29 The reference is to those, such as Cratylus, who followed the famous say­ ings of Heraclitus, panta rhei ("Everything flows") (Fragment 40) and "You can't step into the same river twice, for other waters are always flowing on" (Fragment 48). Cf. Plato, Cratylus 402a; Aristotle, Metaphysics 1OIoa7.
 
 30 This refers to Descartes's thesis that objects of the senses may be doubted though my existence as a thinking thing cannot be (Oeuvres de Descartes, ed.
 
 C. Adam and P. Tannery [Paris: Cerf, 1897-1913] 6:17-21, 25-6). But Kant may also have in mind Descartes's insistence that he does not perceive bodies with his senses, but with his mind (Meditations, Oeuvres de Descartes 6:31-3).
 
 31 Compare this analysis with R 5400 (I776-78? I773-75? 18:189).
 
 32 This is the postulate of empirical thought regarding actuality (A 2 18/ B2M).
 
 33 According to the second-edition "Refutation ofIdealism" (B 274), Kant as­ sociates "dogmatic" idealism with Berkeley and "skeptical" or "problem­ atic" idealism with Descartes. Cf. also Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, 4:375. Baumgarten defines an "idealist" as someone "admitting only spirits into this world" (Metaphysica § 402, cf. § 438).
 
 34 A reference to the antinomies, probably in particular to the second antin­ omy, which threatens us with a contradiction regarding the divisibility of matter (A4 34-45/ B 462-73).
 
 35 See R 5457 (1776-78, 18:187-8) and especially R 5461 (I776-78? 18:189).
 
 36 Regarding mind-body interaction, there were three main systems dis­ cussed in the Wolffian tradition, and mentioned here by Kant. (I) The sys­ tem of physical influence held that minds and bodies causally influence one another by their natural powers. It was associated with Descartes, adopted by Locke, and endorsed by Wolff (Psychologia rationalis [1728], Gesammelte Schriften 11.6 §§ 558-88) and Baumgarten (Metaphysica §§ 763-6); it was defended by Kant's teacher, Martin Knutzen, in Commentatio philosophica de commercio mentis et corporis per injluxum physicum explicando (Philosophical Treatise concerning the Interaction between Mind and Body Explained by Physical Influence) (1735)' Kant criticizes this system in the inaugural dis­ sertation (1770) §§ 16-22 (2:406-10). (2) The system of preestablished harmony is that of Leibniz; it maintains that bodies and minds each follow their own laws, but their actions are coordinated by God in his choice of a maximally harmonious world (see Monadology §§ 78-81). It is critically dis­ cussed by Wolff (Psychologia rationalis §§ 612-42) and Baumgarten (Metaphysica § 768). (3) The "system of supernatural assistance" probably 739 Notes to pages 439-449 refers to the occasionalism of some later Cartesians, such as Arnold Geulincx (1624-1669) and Geraud Cordemoy (d.
