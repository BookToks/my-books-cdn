Knowing that you stay basically the same person over time is so obvious to him that doubting his memory about it would be like doubting every fact ever. That kind of doubt is so extreme it makes skepticism useless (Leibniz, New Essays on Human Understanding 6:238-9).

Baumgarten gives two ideas about what makes someone the same person. The first idea is based on "intellectual memory" (Metaphysica § 641), and the second is about free will (Metaphysica § 756).

Some people, like Cratylus, believed in the idea that "Everything flows" and "You can't step into the same river twice because new water is always flowing" (Fragments 40 and 48). This idea is also mentioned by Plato and Aristotle.

Descartes said that we might doubt what we sense, but we can’t doubt that we exist as thinking beings. He also thought that we don't understand bodies with our senses but with our mind.

Kant talks about these ideas too. He compares different views about the mind and body and how they interact.

There were three main ideas about how mind and body work together in Kant’s time. 

1. Physical influence: Minds and bodies affect each other naturally. Descartes, Locke, Wolff, and Baumgarten believed this. Kant’s teacher Knutzen also supported this idea, but Kant criticized it.

2. Preestablished harmony: Leibniz’s idea that minds and bodies don’t affect each other directly but are coordinated by God to work perfectly together.

3. Supernatural assistance: This idea, from some later thinkers, says God steps in to help the mind and body interact when needed.
