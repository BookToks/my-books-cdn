To figure out what the understanding really does, we need to see wrong judgments as if they’re caused by two different forces pulling in different directions. It’s like they’re at an angle, and the wrong judgment is the result of both forces mixing together. To understand this better, we have to separate the effects of the understanding and our feelings or senses. When we make pure judgments without experience, this separation happens through a special kind of thinking called transcendental reflection. This helps us know where each idea really belongs and shows how the feelings affect our understanding.

We’re not talking about mistakes caused by things like optical illusions, which happen when we use correct rules but get tricked by our imagination. Instead, we’re focusing on a different kind of mistake called transcendental illusion. This kind of mistake happens with ideas that aren’t meant to be used based on experience. Usually, we can check if ideas are right by comparing them to what we experience, but these transcendental illusions ignore that and try to make us think our understanding can go beyond what experience allows. We call ideas that stay within what can be experienced “immanent” principles, and those that try to go beyond are called “transcendent” principles.

When I say “transcendent” principles, I don’t just mean mistakes where the understanding is used wrongly because it wasn’t checked carefully. Those are just errors in judgment. I mean ideas that push us to ignore all the limits we have and claim new knowledge outside what experience can show us. Our feelings or senses, which follow the understanding, give us real knowledge. But when these feelings influence the understanding and affect our judgments, they can also cause mistakes.
