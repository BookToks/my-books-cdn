When we think about how judgments work, putting one kind of judgment into just one group means we have to take it away from other groups. In a disjunctive judgment, the ideas involved are connected because they rule each other out. Even though they can't all be true at once, together they cover all possibilities for a certain idea. This is important to understand for what comes next.

Judgments also have something called modality, which is a special part of them. Modality doesn’t change what the judgment is about; it only changes how we think about the judgment itself. There are three types of modality: problematic, assertoric, and apodictic.

Problematic judgments say something might be true but aren’t sure—it’s just possible. Assertoric judgments say something is actually true. Apodictic judgments say something has to be true, no doubt about it.

For example, in a hypothetical judgment, the two parts (called antecedent and consequent) are usually problematic—they might or might not be true. In a disjunctive judgment, the different choices are also just possibilities, not certain facts. If someone says, "There is perfect justice," they might just be guessing—it’s a possible idea, not a proven fact. But the conclusion that follows can be treated as true.

So, some judgments can be false but still help us understand the truth by showing us what is not true. For instance, saying "The world exists by blind chance" might be just a possible idea someone considers. Even if it’s false, it helps us find the true explanation by eliminating wrong ones.

A problematic judgment is one that just shows what could be true, like a guess or an assumption. It doesn’t claim to be real. An assertoric judgment, on the other hand, says something is actually true. For example, in a logical argument, the first part might be just a possibility (problematic), but the next part is treated as true (assertoric).

It’s like different parts of thinking: understanding deals with possibilities, judgment picks what’s true, and reason works on what must be true. More explanation about this will come later.
