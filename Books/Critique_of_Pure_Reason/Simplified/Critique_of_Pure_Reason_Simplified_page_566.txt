The transcendental ideal is sometimes called an ideal of sensibility, but this isn’t quite right. It’s supposed to be a perfect example that real experiences try to match, but it can’t actually give any clear rules that we can explain or test.

Reason, on the other hand, aims to fully understand things by following rules we know before experience. It imagines an object that can be completely described by these rules, even if we don’t have enough experience to prove it exists. This idea goes beyond what we can experience.

Every idea is uncertain about what it doesn’t include. It follows the rule that for any two opposite properties, only one can be true. This is just a basic logic rule that doesn’t depend on what we know, only on how thinking works.

But things also follow a stronger rule called thoroughgoing determination. This means that out of all possible properties, one must apply to a thing when compared to its opposite. This rule is more than just basic logic because it looks at all possible properties together. It assumes this from the start and uses it to explain how things can be possible.
