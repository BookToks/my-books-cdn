But what is even more important than all that has been said is this: some kinds of knowledge go beyond anything we can experience. They seem to make us think about things that don’t come from what we can see or feel.

These kinds of knowledge go beyond the world of our senses, where experience can’t help us know what’s right or wrong. These are the big questions our reason tries to answer, which we believe are way more important and impressive than anything we learn just by observing the world. We are willing to take risks and make mistakes rather than stop exploring these important ideas. These big questions are about God, freedom, and life after death.

The study that tries to answer these questions is called metaphysics. At first, metaphysics starts confidently, without checking if our reason is actually capable of handling such huge questions.

You might think that once someone leaves the world of experience, they wouldn’t just start building ideas based on unknown principles without first checking if those ideas have a strong foundation. It would make sense to ask how our understanding gets these ideas before experience, and what their value or limits are.

Actually, this is what should naturally happen if we think about what really ought to happen. But if we think about what usually happens, it’s no surprise that people have ignored this investigation for a long time.
