A kind and generous Lord,  

Working to help science grow is also helping you, because science and your support are closely connected. You don’t just protect science because of your position, but also because you love and understand it deeply.  

Because of this, I am using the only way I can to show you how thankful I am for the trust you have given me, even if it might not seem like much.  

For someone who enjoys thinking and exploring ideas, having approval from a smart and fair judge is a big encouragement. This kind of work is very useful but its benefits are far away, so many people don’t understand it.  

I dedicate this writing to such a judge and to your kind attention. I also trust you to watch over all my future writings. With great respect, I am your humble and obedient servant, Immanuel Kant.  

Königsberg, March 29, 1781.
