Time is something that we understand by putting moments one after another. Everything we see or experience happens in space or time, so we understand things by putting parts together step by step.

Because of this, we always think of things as made up of many smaller parts. This is true for things we can measure in space, like length or size, which we understand by adding parts together.

This way of putting parts together in our imagination helps us understand shapes and geometry. Geometry has rules that tell us how things work in space, like “there’s only one straight line between two points” or “two lines don’t always make a space.” These rules only apply to things we can measure in space.

When we talk about size or amount—like “how big is something?”—there are some statements we know are true without needing proof. But these are not rules like geometry’s. For example, when you add or subtract equal things, the result is equal, and we know this right away because we understand the parts are the same.

Geometry’s rules are special because they are always true and don’t just come from experience. But when we talk about numbers, like 7 + 5 = 12, this isn’t a rule in the same way. We don’t think about the number 12 by just thinking about 7 and 5 separately or even when we combine them. Adding numbers is something we learn, but it’s not a rule that applies to everything in the same way geometry’s rules do.
