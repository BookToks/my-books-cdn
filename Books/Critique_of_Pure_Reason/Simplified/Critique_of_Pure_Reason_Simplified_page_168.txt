The Transcendental Doctrine of Elements  
First Part: The Transcendental Aesthetics

No matter how we understand something or how we connect our thoughts to objects, the way we relate to them right away is through something called intuition. This happens only when the object is given to us, which means it has to affect our mind in some way. 

The ability to get ideas or images because objects affect us is called sensibility. So, objects come to us through sensibility, and only sensibility gives us intuition. But we use understanding to think about these intuitions and form ideas or concepts. All thinking, whether direct or indirect, has to connect back to intuition, which for us means it has to come from sensibility, because that's the only way objects can be given to us.

When an object affects our mind and changes our ideas, this effect is called sensation. The intuition we get from sensation is called empirical intuition. The unknown object we get from this empirical intuition is called an appearance. I call the part of the appearance that matches the sensation its matter, and the part that lets us see the many parts of the appearance as one whole is called its form.
