I will call the process of putting things together by looking at their causes, starting from the closest cause to the thing you see and going back to earlier causes, the regressive synthesis. The process of putting things together by looking at their effects, starting from the closest effect and moving to later ones, is called the progressive synthesis. The first one goes backward (antecedentia), and the second one goes forward (consequentia). Cosmological ideas deal with the whole chain of causes (regressive synthesis) and move backward, not forward. If they go forward, that’s just a random question, not a necessary one, because to fully understand what we see, we need to know its causes, not its effects.

To make a list of ideas based on categories, we first start with the two main parts of all experience: space and time. Time is a series by itself (it’s the basic rule for all series), so when we look at a moment in time, the past is the cause (antecedentia), and the future is the effect (consequentia). So, the big idea of reason about the total series of causes only applies to all past time. According to this, the entire past is seen as necessary for the present moment.

Space is different because it doesn’t have a direction like time does. Space is a whole made up of parts that all exist at the same time, not one after another like a series. I can only see the current moment in time as caused by past time, never as the cause of the past, because the present only happens after the past has passed. But in space, the parts don’t depend on one another in order; they all exist together. So space isn’t a series like time is. Still, the way we put together the many parts of space happens in time, so this process does have a series.

When measuring space (like measuring feet in a rod), each part of space is thought of as a cause for the edges of the previous parts. So measuring space is like putting together a series of causes for a given thing. But because the causes and effects in space aren’t clearly separate, moving forward or backward in space feels like the same thing.

Even though one part of space doesn’t come from another part, it is limited by it. So every part of space that has a boundary is also caused by another space that acts as the boundary, and this goes on like that.
