A "paralogism of pure reason" is like a trick our mind plays on us. It’s when we confuse something about how we think with something real about ourselves. 

Before Kant introduced a special way to explain how we understand categories from our awareness, he didn’t warn about this mistake. So, when he added this new explanation, he also gave a warning not to misunderstand it. After that, it made sense for Kant to talk more about ideas like God, which might not be proven but still help us in a moral way.

There’s a note from March 1780, either a last draft or a reminder while Kant was writing the Critique. It sums up his ideas and points to one last part of the book called the Canon. Kant says that the main goal of metaphysics is about God and the future, and how these ideas affect how we act. Morality doesn’t depend on these ideas, but without them, our actions wouldn’t have real meaning. 

This is a bit mysterious, but Kant explains in all three of his Critiques that the highest good—being both good and happy—is something we can only imagine if there’s a smart and kind creator who gives us time to become better and make the world right for our goals. This idea isn’t what makes us act morally, but it’s needed to make sense of why being moral is rational.

Kant takes these tricky ideas from metaphysics and uses them in a practical way. He talks about a "canon" of pure reason, which means knowing when to use reason in a good way and when to be careful. This "canon" became part of a bigger plan for the Critique, including a "Doctrine of Method" alongside the "Doctrine of Elements," which covers parts called the Transcendental Aesthetic, Analytic, and Dialectic.

By 1779 or 1780, Kant had put all this together and was ready to write the Critique. On May 1, 1781, he told his friend Herz that his book, the Critique of Pure Reason, would be published at the Easter book fair after many years of delays and apologies.
