Such a "paralogism of pure reason" would really be "a tran­ scendental subreption," an illusion in which "the unity of apperception, which is subjective, would be taken for the unity of the subject as a thing."I63 We find no such warning in Kant before we find the intro­ duction of a separate transcendental deduction of the categories from the unity of consciousness; so we can assume that the expansion of the "Dialectic" to include paralogisms of pure reason separate from the second and third antinomies was a cautionary response to the new deduction, Kant's own warning about what not to read into his deduc­ tion. Then once the structure of the "Dialectic" had been so expanded, it would not have been unnatural for Kant to add a fuller treatment about theoretically unjustified though morally useful conceptions of God as well.
 
 One last note, written on a matriculation record from March 1780, and thus either a last draft for the about to be written Critique or a memo written during its composition, recapitulates much of this out­ line and then adds a reference to one final section of the Critique: To the Canon: the end of the whole of metaphysics is God and the future and the end of these [in] our conduct, not as though morality must be arranged in accordance with these, but because without these morality would be without consequences.164 This is cryptic, and can only be fully understood in light of the argu­ ment that Kant develops, over all three Critiques, that the highest good or maximization of both virtue and happiness, which we can only con­ ceive of as being made possible by an intelligent and benevolent Author of the world prepared to give us the time necessary to perfect our virtue and to make the world suitable for the achievement of our ends, is not the motivation for virtuous action but is presupposed by its rationality.
 
 This is the practical use to which Kant will put the theoretical illusions of metaphysics. Conceiving of a "canon" of pure reason as well as its critique -that is, a doctrine of its positive practical use as well as the negative criticism of its misguided theoretical use -was thus the final stage in conceiving of the structure and content of the Critique, where this "canon" would be expanded into a "Doctrine of Method" that would accompany the "Doctrine of Elements," into which the "Tran­ scendental Aesthetic," "Transcendental Analytic," and "Transcendental Dialectic" would be placed.
 
 With all of this in place by 1779 or 178o, Kant was finally able to 65 Introduction write the Critique, and to announce to Herz on 1 May 1781, after a decade of apologies and postponements, that "In the current Easter book fair there will appear a book of mine, entitled Critique of Pure Reason.
