The world we see and experience is always changing. Without these changes, we wouldn’t be able to understand time or how things happen one after another.

Every change happens because of something that came before it. This means there is a chain of causes and effects that goes back to something that must exist without depending on anything else. This “something” is absolutely necessary.

This necessary thing is part of the world we experience. If it were outside the world, then all the changes we see would come from something outside, which doesn’t make sense.

Also, the start of any change has to happen at a time when that change didn’t exist yet. So, the cause that starts everything must exist even before the changes begin.

Time itself, as the way we understand changes, comes before the changes happen. But we only understand time and changes because we perceive them through our senses and awareness.
