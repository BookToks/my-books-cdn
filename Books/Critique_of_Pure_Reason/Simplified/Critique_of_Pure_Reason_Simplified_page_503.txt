a Proof The world of sense, as the whole of all appearances, at the same time contains a series of alterations. For without these, even the temporal series, as a condition of the possibility of the world of sense, would not be given to us. * Every alteration, however, stands under its condition, which precedes it in time, and under which it is necessary. Now every conditioned that is given presupposes, in respect of its existence, a complete series of conditions up to the unconditioned, which alone is absolutely necessary. Thus there must exist something absolutely nec­ essary, if an alteration exists as its consequence. This necessary being itself, however, belongs to the world of sense. For supposing it is out­ side it, then the series of alterations in the world would derive from it, A45� B 482 without this necessary cause itself belonging to the world of sense.
 
 Now this is impossible. For since the beginning of a time-series can be determined only through what precedes it in time, the supreme condi­ tion of the beginning of a series of changes must exist in the timeb when the series was not yet (for the beginning is an existence, preceded by a time in which the thing that begins still was not). Thus the causalA452 / B 482 * Time, as formal condition of the possibility of alterations, indeed precedes ite objectively, yet subjectively and in the reality of consciousness, this represen­ tation is given, like any other, only through the occasion of perceptions.

 b Fourth edition: " ...i n the world" C dieser. The antecedent of this singular dative feminine pronoun is unclear, and a matter of dispute; Erdmann prefers to read diesen, making the pronoun plural, and (by impli­ cation) referring it to "alterations"; on our reading, the singular pronoun refers to the possibility of alterations (thus requiring no textual emendation).
