Here’s what this means: I can only understand things through my own mind and the way I see them inside myself. All the things I can imagine are connected to each other because of the special way I experience them.

All things happen in time. Because of how we sense time inside us, everything has a specific place in relation to other things.

Kant says the same thing about space. Space is the way we understand objects outside of ourselves. It’s like a single picture where every object has its own exact spot next to the others. Space is just the shape or form we use to organize what we see, even without any actual stuff in it.

Kant also says that to put things in their exact place in space and time, we need to use certain ideas or rules in our mind. We only get information through our senses, so the ideas we use have to help us organize and make sense of what we sense. These ideas have to be general and follow rules.

There are two kinds of understanding: one that learns from experience, and one that is more natural and common. The common understanding is better when we figure out rules after seeing examples, but when rules come before experience, this doesn’t apply.

Kant hadn’t fully realized yet that ideas only work when combined with what we sense. Later, he said, “Thoughts without content are empty, and senses without ideas are blind.” He also suggested that the special ideas we have before experience act as rules to organize what we sense, but he didn’t yet explain exactly how or why.

Finally, Kant says that even when we learn new ideas from experience, we still depend on these special ideas we have before experience to organize what we learn. This is important because it shows that his theory about these special ideas isn’t just about science, but about all the knowledge we have in everyday life.
