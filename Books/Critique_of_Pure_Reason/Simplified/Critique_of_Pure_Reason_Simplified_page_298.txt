This passage explains how different basic ideas are organized to understand things clearly.

There are four main groups of these ideas: 

1. Axioms of intuition,  
2. Anticipations of perception,  
3. Analogies of experience, and  
4. Postulates of empirical thinking.

The writer picked these names carefully to show how these ideas differ in how we prove and use them.

Some of these ideas, especially those about size and quality, can be known for sure through direct intuition. Others need reasoning and thinking to be understood, but both types can be completely certain.

The first group is called "mathematical principles" because they are clear and exact like math. The second group is called "dynamical principles" because they deal with changing things and need more reasoning.

There is also a note that all combinations of ideas are either joining parts together or connecting them in some way.

Finally, the passage talks about how perception is our awareness of what we see or experience before we even think about it, and this fits into understanding physical and mental processes.
