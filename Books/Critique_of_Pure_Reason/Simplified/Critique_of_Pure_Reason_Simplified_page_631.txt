Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III talks about how we try to understand the purpose behind things in nature. We want to see if there’s a perfect plan or design that everything follows. If we can’t find this perfect plan in the natural world, then how can we believe there’s a perfect being that created everything?

Having a complete and perfect system is the best use of our reason. The idea of a perfect system is connected to how we think. So, it makes sense to believe there’s a perfect mind that created the order we see in nature.

In the Antinomy of Pure Reason, we said that every question our reason asks should have an answer. We can’t just say we don’t know because our understanding is limited, especially when it comes to questions about reason itself. These questions come from how reason works inside us.

Now, we can confirm this bold idea about two important questions reason asks. This completes our look at how reason argues with itself.

So, if someone asks whether there is something beyond the world that explains how the world is ordered by universal laws, the answer is yes. The world is made up of appearances, so there must be something beyond it that is the real cause.

What I said earlier about the psychological idea being a rule for how we use reason saves me from going into a long discussion about the mistake people make when they think the unity of all our inner experiences is a real thing on its own. This is similar to how the Critique talks about the idea of God.
