When we think about breaking something down, it might seem like the opposite of putting things together, but actually, breaking down always depends on putting things together first. If your mind hasn’t combined anything yet, it can’t break anything apart because only combined things can be separated.

Besides just knowing about the parts and how they fit together, the idea of combining also means there’s a unity—everything fits into one whole. This unity isn’t created by combining things; it has to exist first so that combining is even possible. This unity is different from the usual idea of “one” in logic because it comes before any logical thinking. It’s something deeper that makes understanding and thinking possible.

Now, about how we are aware of ourselves when we think: the phrase “I think” has to go with all the things I’m aware of. Otherwise, some thoughts would happen without me realizing, which would mean they aren’t really my thoughts. The kind of awareness you have before you even start thinking is called intuition.

All the different things you notice through your senses connect in some way to your sense of “I think.” This awareness isn’t just from your senses; it’s a spontaneous action of your mind. We call this “pure apperception” or “original apperception” because it’s the basic self-awareness that says “I think” and that has to be there with all your other thoughts. It’s what makes it possible to have any thoughts at all.
