Sometimes, it’s easier to show the limits of what we learn from experience than to prove that our judgments always have to be true. Or, it might be easier to show that we think some judgments apply everywhere, rather than showing they have to be true all the time. So, it’s best to look at these two ideas separately, because each one is definitely true on its own.

It’s easy to see that in how humans think, there are some judgments that are always true and universal, meaning they don’t depend on experience. For example, in science, all math statements are like this. From everyday thinking, the idea that every change must have a cause works too. The idea of a cause already means it must be connected to an effect and follow a strict rule everywhere. This wouldn’t make sense if, like the philosopher Hume said, it was just based on seeing things happen together a lot and forming a habit of thinking they’re connected.

Even without these examples, we can show that these pure, universal ideas are necessary just for us to have any experience at all. If all the rules we use to understand the world came only from experience and could change, then experience itself wouldn’t be certain. So, these rules can’t just come from experience—they have to come before it. But for now, it’s enough to know that our mind uses these pure ideas, and that’s a fact.

Not just in judgments, but even in the ideas we have, some come from before experience. If you take your idea of a body and remove everything you learn from experience—like color, softness, weight, or even that it can’t be passed through—there’s still the idea of space where the body was. You can’t get rid of that idea. Similarly, if you take away everything you learn from experience about any object, whether it’s physical or not, you still can’t remove the idea that it’s a substance or depends on something else. This shows that these ideas come from your mind itself, before any experience.
