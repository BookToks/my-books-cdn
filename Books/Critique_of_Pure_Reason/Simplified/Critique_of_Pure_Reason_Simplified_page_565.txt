We don’t need to reach as high as that, but we have to admit that human reason includes not only ideas but also ideals. These ideals don’t create things like Platonic ideas do, but they still have practical power. They help guide us toward perfecting certain actions. Moral ideas aren’t completely pure ideas of reason because they are based on something real, like feeling pleasure or pain. But when reason sets limits on freedom that could be wild or uncontrolled, these moral ideas can still work well if we focus just on their form.

Virtue and human wisdom, in their purest form, are ideas. The wise person, like the Stoic sage, is an ideal—a perfect person who exists only in our thoughts but matches the idea of wisdom completely. Just like an idea gives a rule to follow, this ideal acts as the original image or model for how we should act. We don’t have any other standard for our behavior except this perfect, almost divine person, and we compare ourselves to this ideal to judge and improve ourselves, even though we can never fully reach it.

These ideals might not actually exist in real life, but they aren’t just made-up stories either. They give reason an important standard—something fully complete—to help us measure how incomplete or imperfect we are. But trying to make the ideal real, like showing the wise person in a story, doesn’t really work. It’s kind of silly because real life’s limits always stop us from making the perfect idea into a reality, and this can make even good ideas seem fake or like fiction.

This is how the ideal of reason works: it is based on clear ideas and serves as a rule or model for us to follow or judge by. But things created by imagination are very different. No one can fully explain or describe them clearly. They are like quick sketches or random details that connect different appearances, not clear images. They are more like the vague pictures artists or critics keep in their minds, which can’t be fully shared with others.
