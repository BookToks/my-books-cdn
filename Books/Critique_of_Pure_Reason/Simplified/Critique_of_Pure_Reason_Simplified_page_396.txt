Empty concept without object, ens rationis.
 
 2. 3· Empty object Empty intuition of a concept, without an object, nihil privativum. ens imaginarium.
 
 4· Empty object without concept, nihil negativum.
 
 One sees that the thought-entity (No. I) is distinguished from the nonentity (No. 4) by the fact that the former may not be ccunted among the possibilities because it is a mere invention (although not self-con­ tradictory), whereas the latter is opposed to possibility because even its concept cancels itself out. Both, however, are empty concepts. The nihil B 349 privativum (NO. 2) and the ens imaginarium (No. 3), on the contrary, are empty data for concepts. If light were not given to the senses, then one would also not be able to represent darkness, and if extended beings were not perceived, one would not be able to represent space. Negation as well as the mere form of intuition are, without something real, not objects.o a Objecte 333 Transcendental Logic Second Part Transcendental DialecticI Introductiona I Transcendental illusion.
