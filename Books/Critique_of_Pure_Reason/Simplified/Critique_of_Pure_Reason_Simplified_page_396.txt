An empty concept without an object is called "ens rationis."

An empty object is an empty idea of a concept without a real object, called "nihil privativum" or "ens imaginarium."

An empty object without a concept is called "nihil negativum."

You can see that a thought-entity (No. 1) is different from a non-entity (No. 4) because the first one is just made up (but not impossible), while the second one is impossible because its idea cancels itself out. Both are empty concepts. 

The "nihil privativum" (No. 2) and the "ens imaginarium" (No. 3) are empty things that can still be used for ideas. For example, if you didn’t have light to see, you couldn’t imagine darkness. And if you didn’t notice things around you, you couldn’t understand space. 

Negation and the way we imagine things don’t become real objects without something real to base them on.
