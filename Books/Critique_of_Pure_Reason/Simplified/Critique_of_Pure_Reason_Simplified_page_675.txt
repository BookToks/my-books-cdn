Imagine trying to prove a math fact by just guessing it might be true. Pure thinking, without any experience, can only know things for sure or not at all. So, when pure reason makes a judgment, it’s never just a guess. It’s either no judgment or absolute certainty.

Opinions and guesses about real things can only happen when we’re explaining something we actually see or when we follow rules based on experience. Making guesses outside of what we can experience is just playing with ideas, unless you think that guessing might help find the truth.

Even though pure reason doesn’t allow guesses to prove ideas, guesses can be used to defend those ideas in arguments. Defending doesn’t mean giving more proof, but stopping the other person’s wrong ideas that try to break your point. For ideas from pure reason, if someone says something is true but can’t prove it, their opponent also can’t prove it wrong. This makes both sides equal in knowledge, and their arguments can’t be fully settled.

However, when it comes to practical use, reason is allowed to assume some things that it couldn’t assume just by thinking alone. This kind of assumption is okay because practical life doesn’t care about perfect proof. So, if you claim something is true for practical reasons, your opponent has to prove you wrong.

Since neither side really knows enough about what’s being argued to say for sure if it’s true or false, the person who assumes something practical has an advantage. They can use the same kind of guesses their opponent would use against them, not to prove their point better, but to show the opponent doesn’t understand the issue well enough to claim they’re right.

In short, in pure thinking, guesses are only allowed as tools in arguments, not as a way to prove something is true.
