Kant argues that both metaphysics (the study of reality) and morality rely on basic principles that we can’t prove just by logic or formal thinking. These principles are important because they are the foundation of his later philosophy, where he says that the main ideas in both fields are new and known before experience. But in his earlier work, Kant didn’t yet understand how we know these unprovable principles because he thought philosophy’s method was just about analyzing ideas, not creating new ones like math does. Before he could write his big works, he needed to find a way for philosophy to create new knowledge like math does.

This discovery happened in the 1770s and helped him write his famous book, the Critique of Pure Reason.

After this, Kant changed his view. He no longer thought math and philosophy used completely different methods. Instead, he said both use a method that creates new knowledge. But there is still a difference: math deals with clear and specific things, while philosophy deals with general ideas about how we experience things. Philosophy uses this method to find the basic rules that connect our thoughts to what we experience.

So, Kant’s earlier work already had some ideas about math, but he didn’t yet realize that both math and philosophy use similar creative methods.

Once Kant understood this, he kept the idea that math gives us clear results about specific things, while philosophy gives us general principles about how we experience the world.

In one of his essays from 1762-63, Kant talked about a different topic. He looked at cases where things are truly opposite, not just logically different, like positive and negative numbers, moving in opposite directions, or feeling pleasure and pain.
