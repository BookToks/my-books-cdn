30 You can also check out other writings by Kant from 1783 to 1793 and a book called Metaphysik Volckmann for more on this topic. But in the first version of the introduction to his book Critique of Judgment, Kant says the "general theory of time" doesn’t have much to it.

36 For similar ideas, look at Kant’s writings from 1788-89 and his essay about Ludwig Heinrich Jakob’s review of Mendelssohn’s work. Also, check out his argument against Leibniz’s monadology in another book.

37 To understand the difference between what seems real and what’s just an illusion, see Kant’s notes from 1776-78.

38 Berkeley usually argues that matter isn’t real, not space and time. So, Kant is more right about Berkeley in the last part of this sentence than the first. Kant thinks Berkeley’s ideas come from believing space and time can’t exist by themselves because they have contradictions. But in Berkeley’s book The Principles of Human Knowledge, he does criticize the idea of time as something simple and real on its own, and also the idea of space and motion separated from other things. Here, Berkeley’s thinking is closer to what Kant says.

2 Early on, Kant talked about limits to what he later called "general logic" in his writings from 1769-70 and 1776-78. Other early notes are from the same time, and later ones from the 1780s and 1790s. Also, check out Kant’s Logic book edited by Benjamin Gottlob Jasche.

3 Kant probably got this example from a Greek writer named Lucian of Samosata, who lived around 120 A.D. In one story, a wise man named Demonax saw two strange philosophers arguing. One asked silly questions, and the other gave answers that didn’t make sense. Demonax joked that it was like one was milking a goat while the other was holding a sieve underneath, so nothing was being caught.
