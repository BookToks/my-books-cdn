It’s impossible to know the exact position of each thing in time because absolute time isn’t something we can directly sense. Instead, our understanding organizes appearances by time, which lets us put them in order and connect them. This happens naturally and applies to every moment.

By nature, we mean how appearances are combined according to certain necessary rules or laws. Some of these laws exist before experience and make nature possible. Other laws are found through experience, but they depend on those original laws that allow experience to happen at all. These rules show that all appearances are part of one nature because without this unity, we couldn’t have any experience or understand objects.

When proving these important laws of nature, we have to use a special method. If we tried to prove them just by using ideas or concepts—like saying everything that exists stays the same, or every event follows something before it, or that things happening at the same time relate by a rule—our efforts would fail. That’s because we can’t figure out how one thing exists or works just by thinking about it, no matter how much we analyze.

So, what can we do? We look at the possibility of experience itself. To really know something, all objects must be possible to experience. This experience depends on the way we connect all appearances together in our mind. By understanding this, we found the basic conditions that make it necessary to place everything in time. Without these conditions, even understanding time through experience wouldn’t be possible. We also found rules that help us predict how everything is connected in time.
