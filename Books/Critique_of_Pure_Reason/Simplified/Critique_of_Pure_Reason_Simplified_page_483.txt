Here’s the proof: If we think the world never had a starting point in time, then before any moment you pick, the world would have already gone through forever. That means an infinite number of events or states would have already happened, one after another. But infinity means you can never finish counting or putting things together one by one. So, having an infinite past in time is impossible. This means the world must have had a beginning, which was the first thing to prove.

For the second point, imagine the opposite again: the world is an infinite whole that exists all at once, with no limits in space or time. When we think about something that isn’t fully defined, like an amount or size, we only understand it by putting its parts together. To think of the whole thing, we need to add all its parts one after another until it’s complete.

We can understand something as a complete whole if it has clear boundaries, without needing to measure or add up every part. These boundaries show it’s finished and nothing more can be added.

The idea of a whole is basically the way we imagine putting all the parts together. Since we can’t see the whole at once in this case, we only get the idea by thinking about adding the parts until they’re all included.

Finally, the argument says the world can’t be infinite in time and space all at once, because that would mean an impossible infinite series of parts or events.
