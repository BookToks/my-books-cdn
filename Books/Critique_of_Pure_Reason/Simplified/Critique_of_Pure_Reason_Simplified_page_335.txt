The categories of modality have a special feature: they don’t add anything new to the idea of a thing itself. Instead, they only show how the thing connects to our ability to understand it. Even if we already have a complete idea of something, we can still ask if it’s possible, real, or necessary. This doesn’t change the thing itself, just how it relates to our understanding and experience.

Because of this, the rules about modality just explain what we mean by possibility, reality, and necessity when we use them based on experience. They limit how we can use these ideas to what we can actually experience, not beyond that. If these categories are more than just logical ideas and say something about things themselves, they have to be about things we can experience and understand together.

The idea that things are possible means they must exist in time and space to be real. Some philosophers say everything real is necessary in some way, but this only applies to things as we understand them, not things beyond our experience.

What exists outside our thoughts is fully determined. This is the basis for the idea of the most real being and why we think of absolute necessity. Also, when we say something is not true, we are limiting what it can be. Reason works by understanding these limits.

We don’t say that substances themselves are random or changeable, only the things that happen to them. When making guesses or hypotheses, we always check if they are possible, if what we imagine could be real, and if they must be true based on experience.
