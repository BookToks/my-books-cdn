The way we can have experiences is the reason we can understand all ideas before we actually experience anything, just like how space and time help us understand what we sense.

This special connection in our mind makes it possible for all the things we see or feel in one experience to be linked together by rules. This connection wouldn’t be possible if our mind couldn’t realize that all these different things come from the same way of thinking. 

So, being aware of ourselves is also being aware that all the things we experience are connected by rules. These rules not only help us remember things but also help us understand what the object is that we are experiencing. Our mind couldn’t think about itself in all these different experiences if it didn’t already know how to combine them into one thought using these rules.

Now, we can also better understand what we mean when we talk about objects. Every thought or idea is about something, and those things can also be thought about by something else. What we see or feel right away are called appearances, and what connects these appearances to the real object is called intuition. 

But these appearances aren’t the real things themselves; they are just ideas. The real thing behind these ideas can’t be seen or sensed directly by us, and this is called the transcendental object. This pure idea of an object is the same in all our thoughts and helps us connect what we think to something real.

This idea doesn’t include any specific details we can sense but is about the unity we find in all our thoughts when they relate to an object. This connection is the necessary link in our mind that puts all these experiences together into one thought.

Because this connection has to exist before any experience, the way we relate to real objects depends on a basic rule: all the things we experience must follow certain rules that combine them into one understanding.
