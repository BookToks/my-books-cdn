If something is shown as a subject by itself and not as a part of something else, we don’t learn anything about how it lasts over time. Also, we can’t say it is simple just because it lasts. So, this doesn’t tell us what the soul experiences when the world changes. If someone said the soul is a simple part of matter, then from what we know about matter, we could say it lasts and maybe never dies. But the idea of “I think” doesn’t tell us any of this.

The fact that the thinking self in us understands itself using pure ideas, especially ideas about total unity, comes from this: Self-awareness (apperception) is the reason we can have these ideas. These ideas help us put together the many different things we notice in a way that makes sense to us. Self-awareness is like the picture of what makes everything one whole, and it itself is not caused by anything else.

So, the "I" that thinks (the soul) sees itself as something that always exists, is simple, and stays the same over time. It is the base for everything else that exists. We can say it doesn’t really understand itself by using these ideas, but it understands the ideas and all things through the total unity of self-awareness. That means it knows things through itself.

It’s interesting that the "I" can’t understand itself as an object, even though it needs to exist to understand other things. The thinking self is different from the self it thinks about, like how knowing something is different from the thing you know. But it’s very easy to mistakenly think that the unity we find in our thoughts is the same as a real, separate unity inside us. This mistake could be called confusing consciousness with a real, lasting thing.

If we want to give a name to the mistake made in some arguments about the soul, it can be called a fallacy where the main idea uses a pure, general idea in a special way, but the smaller ideas and conclusion use that idea in a real, physical way about the soul. For example, the idea of “substance” in the argument about simplicity is a pure idea, but when we talk about the soul, we use it as if it’s a real, physical thing.
