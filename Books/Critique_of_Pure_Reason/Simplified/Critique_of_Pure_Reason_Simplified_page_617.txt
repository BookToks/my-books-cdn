Some smart people argue about what makes humans, animals, plants, or even minerals different. Some think that certain traits come from family lines or races, while others believe nature doesn’t set any built-in differences and that all differences are just random. To really understand this, you’d have to look closely at the thing itself, but it’s too complicated for anyone to say for sure.

This argument is really about two different ways of thinking. One side believes nature is full of many different things, while the other thinks nature is basically one thing. These ideas can be combined, but if people treat them like absolute truths, it just causes fights and slows down finding the real answer. We need a way to bring these ideas together so reason can be satisfied.

It’s the same with the idea called the “ladder of continuity,” which says all living things are connected in a chain. This idea was popularized by Leibniz and supported by Bonnet. But this ladder is really just a way of trying to find order based on what reason wants, not something proven by nature itself. The steps on this ladder are too far apart, and what seem like small differences are actually big gaps in nature.

Based on what we see, we can’t really figure out what nature’s plan is. However, trying to find order in nature like this is a good way to guide our thinking, even if experience can’t fully prove it. This idea doesn’t tell us exactly what’s true, but it helps point us toward understanding nature as a whole.

The ideas of pure reason don’t cause confusion by themselves. Instead, confusion happens when people misuse these ideas. Reason gives us problems to solve, and it’s the highest judge of our ideas—it doesn’t trick us or create illusions on its own.
