In this part, the idea of a "body" isn’t directly mentioned, but it includes what makes that idea possible. For example, we start with "Everything made of parts can change." Then, we move to a closer idea that "Bodies are made of parts." Finally, we combine these to say, "So, bodies can change." This way, I reach a conclusion by following a chain of reasons.

Every chain of reasoning can keep going. This means we can keep making new conclusions based on earlier ones, either by going deeper into the reasons or by looking at the results. But we notice that these two ways of thinking work differently.

When we look up the chain to the reasons behind a conclusion, we have to assume that all the reasons are already known and complete. This is because we can only understand the conclusion if we accept all the reasons are there from the start. But when we look down the chain at what follows from a conclusion, the future results aren’t fixed or fully known yet. This means that moving forward is just a possible idea, not something already set.

So, if we see a conclusion as depending on reasons, we have to think of all those reasons as complete and given. But if we see the same conclusion as the start of other ideas that come after it, we don’t need to know how far those ideas go or if they are complete. That’s because the conclusion itself is already certain based on its reasons.

It might be that, on the side of reasons, there is a first and most important reason, which means the chain of reasons has a clear starting point. Even if we can’t always find that, we still use this kind of step-by-step reasoning to reach the conclusion we want.
