The pure ideas we use to understand things are always the same in our mind and can’t come with any extra images or ideas. I call this sameness the “transcendental unity of self-consciousness” because it shows how we can know things before experience. 

All the different pictures or ideas we get from our senses wouldn’t all be mine if they didn’t belong together in one self-conscious mind. Even if I’m not aware of each one as mine, they have to fit together in one mind, or else they wouldn’t really be mine. From this, we can learn a lot.

This complete sameness of how I notice many different things in my mind means I put these ideas together, and this only works because I’m aware that I’m combining them. Just being aware of each idea alone isn’t enough because that awareness is scattered and doesn’t connect to me as one person. The connection happens when I join one idea with another and know that I’m doing it.

So, it’s only because I can put many different ideas together in one mind that I can understand that this mind is the same in all those ideas. This is called the “analytical unity of apperception,” and it only works if I can first combine ideas in my mind. Thinking that all these ideas belong to me means I can bring them together in one self-conscious mind, or at least I can do that. Even if I’m not yet aware of putting them together, I must be able to do it to say these ideas are mine. Otherwise, I would have many different selves, just like I have many different ideas.
