Chapter III Second: If we stop hoping to find anything useful right from the start, what happens to empirical psychology, which has always tried to connect itself with big ideas about reality, and from which we expected a lot of new understanding today?

Here’s the answer: Empirical psychology belongs where we study nature based on experience, that is, in applied philosophy. Pure philosophy gives us the basic rules we need before we can study nature this way. So, empirical psychology should never be mixed with pure philosophy or metaphysics—it doesn’t really belong there.

Still, because of old traditions, we sometimes let empirical psychology have a small place in metaphysics, but only as a side topic. This is mostly because it’s not developed enough to stand alone, but it’s still important enough not to ignore or put somewhere else where it fits even less. So, it’s like a guest who stays temporarily until it can become part of a complete study of humans, which matches the study of nature based on experience.

This is the basic idea of metaphysics. We once expected more from it than it could actually give us, and we got frustrated when it didn’t meet our hopes.

After looking at all this carefully, we can see that although metaphysics can’t be the foundation of religion, it will always protect it. Human reason tends to argue and question, so it needs metaphysics to keep it in check. Metaphysics helps us understand ourselves better and stops us from making big mistakes in how we think about right and wrong or religion. 

No matter how stubborn some people are in judging a science only by its results and not by what it really is, we will always come back to metaphysics like an old friend we’ve grown apart from. Reason must keep working hard either to find new truths or to fix old ones.

So, metaphysics about nature and morals, and especially the careful study of reason itself, is what real philosophy is. Philosophy connects everything to true wisdom through clear basic rules and self-understanding. It is the only kind of knowledge that, once understood, keeps growing without leading us wrong.
