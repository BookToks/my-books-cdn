I don’t believe that smart and thoughtful people, like Sulzer, who know the problems with old proofs, are right when they say we might one day find clear, obvious proof of two big ideas: that God exists and that there is life after death. I’m sure this will never happen. Because where would reason get the basis for such claims when they are about things we can’t experience or prove?

At the same time, it’s also absolutely sure that no one will ever seriously claim the opposite—that God or an afterlife definitely don’t exist. To prove that, a person would have to show that a highest being or the pure thinking part of ourselves is impossible. But how could they know enough to prove something about things beyond any experience?

So, we don’t need to worry about anyone proving the opposite. We don’t have to come up with complicated school-like proofs either. Instead, we can accept these ideas because they make sense with how we use reason in real life, and they help connect our thinking with what we care about practically. For anyone who opposes this view (not just a critic), we have clear answers ready that will always confuse them. We don’t even need to argue back because we have personal rules of reason on our side that they don’t have. So, we can stay calm and not be bothered by their pointless arguments.

In fact, there really is no real conflict for pure reason. The only place it might happen is in pure theology and psychology, but no serious fighter will show up there with strong proof. Instead, challengers just come with silly jokes and empty boasts, which are easy to laugh off like child’s play. This is comforting because it gives reason new confidence. If reason, which is supposed to get rid of all errors, was itself broken without hope for peace, we’d have nothing to rely on.

Everything in nature serves a purpose. Even poisons help fight other poisons in our bodies, so they can’t be left out from the full set of medicines. The objections against the boldness and pride of pure reason actually help to...
