If we only understood time by how we feel it inside our minds, we wouldn’t be able to tell which event really happened first or second. It would just be a bunch of thoughts happening one after another, but they wouldn’t be connected to anything real. So, when we see things happen, we can’t say one thing comes after another for sure, because the order we notice is just in our heads. That means we can’t really know what’s happening in the world just from the way we experience time.

When we say something happens, we always assume something else came before it, following a certain rule. Without this rule, I wouldn’t say one thing really follows another in the world, because just noticing a sequence in my mind doesn’t prove that things actually happen in that order outside. So, I take my personal feeling of time and try to match it with a rule that says how things really follow each other. Only by doing this can I say something really happened after something else.

It might seem like this goes against what people always say about how we understand the world. Usually, we think we learn about rules, like cause and effect, by watching many things happen and noticing patterns. On that view, the idea that everything has a cause comes from experience, and it’s not guaranteed to always be true—it’s just something we guess from what we see. But this is like other ideas we have, like space and time, which we can only understand clearly because we put them into our experience first.
