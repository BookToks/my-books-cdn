Transcendental ideas come from a type of knowledge called cognition. This knowledge is either an intuition or a concept. Intuition is directly connected to what we are experiencing and is about one specific thing. A concept is indirect because it uses a sign or feature that can apply to many things.

Concepts can be either based on experience or completely pure. Pure concepts come only from our understanding, not from any sensory image, and these are called notions. When a concept is made up of notions that go beyond what we can experience, it’s called an idea or a concept of reason. People who understand this difference don’t like calling a simple image, like the color red, an idea or even a notion.

The transcendental analytic showed how the basic logical form of our thinking can create pure concepts that come before any experience. These pure concepts help us understand objects by combining information. The way we make judgments, turned into concepts from combining what we see, gives us categories that guide how we use our understanding in experience. Similarly, the form of logical arguments (syllogisms), when combined with these categories, creates special pure concepts of reason or transcendental ideas. These ideas guide how we use understanding in all experiences.

Reason works by making universal conclusions based on concepts, and syllogisms are judgments that apply universally before any experience. For example, I can say “Caius is mortal” just by thinking. But I want a concept that explains why this is true, like “human.” After I group Caius under “human,” I understand the full idea that all humans are mortal.

In experience, we don’t encounter concepts of reason, like the idea of something simple that can’t be experienced. Some big ideas, like cosmological ones, relate to things we can sense in the world, but the text about this is incomplete.
