The principles of pure under- B 296 standing, whether they are a priori constitutive (like the mathematical principles) or merely regulative (like the dynamical principles), contain nothing but only the pure schema, as it were, for possible experience; A237 for this has its unity only from the synthetic unity that the under­ standing originally and from itself imparts to the synthesis of the imagination in relation to apperception, and in relation to and agreement with which the appearances, as data for possible cognition, must already stand a priori. But now even if these rules of the understanding are not only true a priori but are rather even the source of all truth, i.e., of the agreement of our cognition with objects,a in virtue of containing the ground of the possibility of experience, as the sum total of all cognition in which objects b may be given to us, still it does not seem enough to us merely to have expounded what is true, but also that which one has desired to know. If, therefore, through this critical in­ vestigation we learn nothing more than what we should in any case have practiced in the merely empirical use of the understanding, even without such subtle inquiry, then it would seem that the advantage that one will draw from it would hardly be worth the expense and preparation. Now to this, to be sure, one can reply that no curiosity is more disadvantageous to the expansion of our knowledgeC than that which would always know its utility in advance, before one has entered into B 297 the investigations, and before one could have the least concept of this utility even if it were placed before one's eyes. But there is one advantage, which can be made both comprehensible and interesting to even A238 the dullest and most reluctant student of such transcendental investigation, namely this: That the understanding occupied merely with its empirical use, which does not reflect on the sources of its own cognition, may get along very well, but cannot accomplish one thing, namely, determining for itself the boundaries of its use and knowing what may lie within and what without its whole sphere; for to this end the deep inquiries that we have undertaken are requisite. But if the un­ derstanding cannot distinguish whether certain questions lie within its horizon or not, then it is never sure of its claims and its possession, but must always reckon on many embarrassing corrections when it continually oversteps the boundaries of its territory (as is unavoidable) and loses itself in delusion and deceptions.
 
 That the understanding can therefore make only empirical use of all its a priori principles, indeed of all its concepts, but never transcendenObjecten n Objecte b , Erkenntnis 355 Doctrine of Elements.
