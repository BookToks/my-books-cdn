The basic ideas of pure understanding, whether they are rules we know without experience (like math rules) or just guidelines (like rules about how things move), are basically just a framework for what we can possibly experience. This framework only works because the understanding itself connects the way we imagine things with how we are aware of them. The things we see or experience have to fit this connection to make sense before we even experience them.

Even though these rules are true on their own and are the source of all truth—because they explain how experience is possible—it’s not enough just to know what is true. We also want to understand what we really want to learn. So, if this deep investigation only shows us what we already practice when we think about things in everyday life, without such detailed study, then it might seem like all the effort isn’t worth it.

But here’s the thing: no curiosity is worse for learning than wanting to know its usefulness before even starting to learn. Sometimes, you can’t see how useful something is until you’ve actually done the work. 

One clear benefit that even the least interested student can understand is this: When we use understanding just based on experience without thinking about where our knowledge comes from, we can do okay. But we can’t figure out the limits of what we can understand or what is beyond our understanding. To do that, we need the deep investigations we are doing here.

If the understanding can’t tell whether certain questions are inside or outside its limits, it will never be sure about what it knows. It will keep making mistakes by going beyond what it can really understand, and it will get confused and tricked by wrong ideas.

So, the understanding can only use all its basic rules for experience, and can’t go beyond that.
