Part II, Division 1, Book II.

The idea of a concept being logically possible means it doesn’t contradict itself. But just because a concept is possible doesn’t mean it actually matches something real. This can trick beginners into thinking it’s true.

It feels weird and even confusing that some concepts should mean something important but can’t be clearly defined. This only happens with categories. Categories only make sense when connected to something we can sense, but this connection is left out in the pure category. Pure categories only show how to group different things under one idea logically.

Because pure categories leave out the sensory part, you can’t tell what kind of object fits into them. So, categories need extra rules to connect them to what we can sense, called schemas. Without these, categories are just ways to think about possible things, not clear ideas about real things. They can’t be defined on their own.

The basic logical parts of judgment—like unity and many-ness, saying yes or no, or subject and predicate—can’t be defined without getting stuck in a loop, because defining them would already need those same parts.

Pure categories are basically ways to think about anything in general, based on how we logically organize what we sense. For example, magnitude is about thinking in terms of quantity, reality is about something true or affirmed, and substance is the main thing all other features depend on.

But the categories don’t tell us what kinds of things need each kind of thinking. Without the sensory input that connects them to real objects, categories don’t relate to any specific thing and can’t define anything clearly.
