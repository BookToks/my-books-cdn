If reason can cause things to happen in the world we see, then it is the way that a chain of events first starts. This cause from reason is not something we can sense and it doesn’t begin itself. So, unlike normal events that happen one after another, this cause doesn’t depend on anything before it. It exists outside of what we can see or touch, and it doesn’t follow time or come from another cause.

But this same cause is also part of what we see, because humans themselves are things we can experience.

Our ability to choose is part of the physical world and causes all our actions. Every factor that shapes human choices is part of natural events and follows the laws of nature, where nothing happens without a cause before it in time. So, no action we see can start completely on its own.

However, when it comes to reason, we can’t say that one state comes before another to cause it. Reason isn’t something we can sense and doesn’t follow time, so it doesn’t work like natural events that happen one after another.

Reason is the lasting cause behind all the things we choose to do. Before any action happens, it’s already shaped by the person’s character we can observe. But for the deeper, non-physical character of reason, time doesn’t matter, and every action comes directly from this pure reason.

This means reason acts freely, without being controlled by anything else before it in nature. This freedom isn’t just about not depending on physical causes, because then reason wouldn’t cause anything we see. Instead, reason can actually start new chains of events on its own. Nothing begins inside reason itself, but reason is the unchanging cause of every choice, allowing no earlier cause in time, even though its effects start in the world we experience.
