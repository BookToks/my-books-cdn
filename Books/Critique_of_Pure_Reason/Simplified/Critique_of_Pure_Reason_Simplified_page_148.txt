All knowledge that comes from experience needs some ideas to be assumed beforehand. So, transcendental philosophy is a kind of philosophy that uses pure reason, just thinking, without relying on experience. But when it comes to practical things, which involve reasons for doing something, feelings are involved, and feelings come from experience.

If we want to organize this science from a big-picture view, it should have two main parts: first, a Doctrine of Elements, and second, a Doctrine of Method of pure reason. Each main part has smaller sections, but we won’t explain those now. What’s important to know is that human knowledge comes from two sources, which might come from one unknown root: sensibility and understanding. Sensibility gives us objects through our senses, while understanding helps us think about those objects.

If sensibility contains ideas that are built-in before experience, which set the rules for how we get objects, then it belongs to transcendental philosophy. The study of how our senses work will be part of the first section, the science of elements, because the way we get objects with our senses happens before we think about those objects.
