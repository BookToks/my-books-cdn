People usually find it easier to understand things they already know than to think about new, unknown things. But here, there’s something strange and confusing. It seems obvious and right to say that because something exists, there must be a being that absolutely has to exist. Yet, when we try to actually imagine or understand this kind of necessary being, our minds just can’t grasp it.

For a long time, people have talked about this absolutely necessary being. But instead of trying to understand what it really means or how we can even think about it, they mostly just tried to prove that it exists. It’s easy to say that this being is something that can’t possibly not exist. But saying this doesn’t help us understand why it has to exist or if this idea even makes sense at all. Just saying it’s “unconditional” doesn’t explain if this idea means anything real or if it’s just empty words.

Even more, people thought they could explain this idea, even though they kind of guessed at it randomly. Because many examples seemed to show it was true, they stopped asking if the idea made sense. For example, in geometry, we say “a triangle has three angles,” and that’s definitely true. So people assumed they understood what it means for something to be absolutely necessary.

But all these examples come from statements or judgments, not from actual things and whether they really exist. The absolute necessity of a statement doesn’t mean the thing it talks about has to exist. The necessity of the statement depends on a condition. For example, the sentence about triangles doesn’t mean three angles absolutely exist all by themselves, only that if a triangle exists, then it must have three angles.
