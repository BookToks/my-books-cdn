Pure ideas in our mind come from some kind of rule we follow to understand things, but sometimes people misunderstand these rules. These so-called special qualities of things are really just logical rules that help us know things in general. They are connected to ideas about quantity, like one thing, many things, or a whole group. But people often think these ideas belong to things themselves, when actually they are just rules for how we think and understand.

When we think about something, there is a unity in the idea, like how a theme ties together a story or a speech. This unity is about how we group different parts of what we know.

Also, the more true results we get from an idea, the more real that idea is. This is like having many true clues that all come from one idea, but not thinking of these clues as a size or amount.

Finally, there is perfection, which means all these clues go back to the one main idea and fit it completely. This is like having a complete picture where everything matches perfectly.

So, these logical rules about how we know things change the ideas about quantity into a way to connect different parts of what we know into one clear thought. The rule for when we have a good idea is that it must have unity (all parts fit together), truth (everything we find from it agrees with itself and experience), and completeness (nothing is missing or needs more explanation). 

The same goes for a guess or theory: it should be clear and simple, its results should make sense and agree with facts, and it should explain everything without needing extra guesses.
