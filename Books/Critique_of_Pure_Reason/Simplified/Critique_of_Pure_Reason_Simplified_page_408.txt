When we talk about ideas in general, we won’t focus on them just yet. But just like we called the basic concepts of understanding “categories,” we will give a new name to the concepts of pure reason and call them “transcendental ideas.” Now, we will explain and support this name.

In our first chapter about these transcendental ideas, we start by talking about ideas in general.

Even though we have many words in our languages, sometimes our minds can’t find the perfect word to explain what we’re thinking. Without the right word, it’s hard to make others understand us or even understand ourselves. Making up new words is risky and usually doesn’t work well. So, before trying to create new words, it’s better to look at old, dead languages to see if they already have a word that fits. Even if the old meaning isn’t completely clear, it’s better to use that word with its closest proper meaning than to confuse everyone by making up a new word.

If there is only one word that fits a certain idea perfectly, and it’s important to keep it separate from other related ideas, then it’s best not to use that word loosely or as a synonym for other words. We should keep the word’s meaning clear and special. Otherwise, the unique thought it represents might get lost among other words that mean different things.

Plato used the word “idea” in a way that shows he meant something that can never be seen or touched by the senses. His ideas go beyond the basic concepts that Aristotle talked about, because nothing we experience with our senses can fully match them. For Plato, ideas are the perfect models of things themselves, not just tools to understand experiences. He thought that these ideas come from the highest reason, and human reason connects to them. But now, our reason is not in its original perfect state and has to work hard to remember these old, hidden ideas through thinking and philosophy.
