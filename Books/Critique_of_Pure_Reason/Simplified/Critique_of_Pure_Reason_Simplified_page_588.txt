You can’t prove the existence of a necessary being (something that must exist) just by looking at the universe. Instead, this idea comes from how our reason works, so we have to study it through thinking itself. Reason is about explaining all our ideas, beliefs, and statements, either by facts or, if they’re just illusions, by what’s happening in our minds.

There’s a kind of mistake that happens in all arguments trying to prove a necessary being exists. These arguments try to work without relying on real-world experience. Even though the cosmological argument starts from the idea that something exists, it doesn’t depend on any specific experience but on pure thinking about existence in general. This pure thinking leads to a natural but tricky illusion: it connects the idea of something necessary with the idea of the highest reality, making us believe that this necessary thing really exists. But this is just an idea, not a fact.

When you assume something exists, it feels like you have to admit that something must exist necessarily. This is the main point of the cosmological argument. But if you just think about any one thing, you can’t say it must exist. You can always imagine it not existing. So even though something necessary must exist to explain everything, you can’t say any particular thing is that necessary being. In other words, when you try to explain why things exist, you have to assume something necessary, but you can’t start by assuming what that necessary thing is.

If you must believe there’s something necessary for everything to exist, but you can’t say any specific thing is necessary, then necessity and chance don’t really apply in the usual way. This is a complex idea about how we understand existence and reason.
