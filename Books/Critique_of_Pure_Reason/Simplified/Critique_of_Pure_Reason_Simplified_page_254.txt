Understanding things depends on how our mind works with what we see and imagine.

We have a part of our mind called imagination that helps us understand things before we even experience them. It connects what we sense with how we think, making sure everything fits together. Without this, we would only see random things without understanding them as real objects, so we wouldn’t really have any experience.

Real experience happens when we notice things, remember them, and recognize what they are. This process uses concepts that help us organize our experiences and know they are true. These ideas, called categories, help us make sense of what we imagine and remember, so everything feels connected and real in our mind.

Because of this, we actually create the order and rules we see in nature. We wouldn’t find this order if our mind didn’t put it there first. The way nature seems to work is something our mind sets up before any experience, so we can understand it. If our mind didn’t have these rules built in, we couldn’t make sense of things or know anything for sure.

In short, the laws of nature come from how our mind understands the world, just like space and time. We know these laws are true and necessary because they come from inside us, not from outside. If they didn’t, we would only see things as random and could never truly understand objects or the world around us.
