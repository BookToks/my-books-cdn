This idea says that our understanding works as one whole system, not just a random collection of thoughts. It connects everything according to certain necessary rules. We can’t really call this idea an object, but it shows how all our concepts fit together as a rule for understanding.

These big ideas don’t come from nature itself. Instead, we ask nature questions based on these ideas. We think our knowledge is incomplete if it doesn’t match them. For example, pure earth, water, or air is hard to find, but we still need these ideas to understand how nature works. We use them to figure out what each natural thing does, like reducing materials to earth (weight), salts and combustibles (force), and water and air (machines) to explain chemical reactions. Even if it’s not said out loud, reason clearly influences how students of nature organize their ideas.

If reason helps us go from general ideas to specific ones, there are two ways this happens: Either the general idea is certain and given, and we just need to judge how the specific fits into it — this is called the "apodictic" use of reason. Or the general idea is just a guess, while the specific things are certain. We check many specific examples to see if they fit the general idea, and if they do, we assume the rule applies to all cases, even ones we haven’t seen — this is called the "hypothetical" use of reason.

The hypothetical use of reason, based on these guess-like ideas, doesn’t prove the universal rule is true for sure. How could we know all possible results that would prove it? Instead, this use of reason helps bring order to our specific knowledge as best as possible and makes the rule closer to being universal.

So, using reason hypothetically helps us build a system that organizes what we know.
