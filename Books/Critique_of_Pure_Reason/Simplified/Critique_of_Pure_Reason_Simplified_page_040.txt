If we change this idea from being about what exists to being about what we can know, it becomes the main point in Kant's "Refutation of Idealism" found in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason.

Kant's first philosophy already had some of his most famous criticisms of earlier thinkers and some important ideas from his later work. But he still needed a new way of doing philosophy to strengthen his arguments and find a solid foundation for his ideas. This new method took him at least twenty more years to figure out.

Before leaving the Nova dilucidatio, we should note that Kant still agreed with some earlier philosophers, especially Leibniz, on a few points. These ideas would only be seriously questioned later. One of these was about free will. Kant talked about this a lot in the Nova dilucidatio. At that time, he accepted the two usual options: determinism, which says every event, including our actions, is caused by past events; and indeterminism, which says free choices aren’t caused by anything before them. Kant called the second option the "indifference of equilibrium," and he rejected it because it seemed to make responsibility impossible.

Instead, Kant agreed with Leibniz’s idea, called "compatibilism." This says that all events have causes, but some actions come from inside a person, based on what they think is best to do. Even if these actions are caused and predictable, they can still be called free or voluntary. Later, in the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant would reject this idea, calling it the "freedom of a turnspit." It became an important job for the Critique of Pure Reason to find a third way between determinism and indeterminism.

Kant did this with his idea of "transcendental idealism," which separates how things appear to us from how they really are. This way, he could agree that Leibniz was right about appearances (or "phenomena") but also allow that the other view might be true about things as they really are ("noumena"). Another idea Kant kept from Leibniz was the "Principle of Coexistence." This says that separate things don’t affect each other just by existing; instead, God keeps everything in harmony.
