The regulative principle of pure reason is a rule for thinking, not a rule that tells us what things really are. It helps us understand how to look at a series of causes and effects, but it doesn’t give us the actual whole picture of those causes by itself. I’ve explained before that this difference stops us from wrongly thinking that an idea, which is just a rule, actually exists as a real thing.

To understand this rule better, we need to know that it doesn’t say what the object is. Instead, it shows us how to follow the chain of causes step by step to get a full idea of the object. If the rule could tell us what the object is, it would be a rule that creates reality, which pure reason can’t do. So, the rule doesn’t decide if the chain of causes is endless or not. It only gives us a way to think about the chain, even though we’ll never reach the very end. The absolute end or “unconditioned” thing doesn’t appear in our experience at all.

First, we need to understand what it means to follow a chain that never ends. People usually use two words to describe this, but it’s hard to explain exactly what the difference is. Mathematicians say “progress to infinity,” meaning something keeps going forever. Philosophers prefer “indefinite progress,” which means the progress isn’t fixed or complete. Without getting into arguments about these terms, I want to explain what I mean clearly.

For example, you can say a straight line can be stretched out forever.
