Chapter 1, Section II could also really mess up his own ideas if he tried to build something based on it. But he doesn’t worry about that because he doesn’t need to stay stuck there. Instead, he still has a chance to work in the real world, where he can hope to build a stronger and better system based on good reasons.

So, in the world of pure reason, there’s really no serious argument. Both sides are just fighting with ideas that don’t have any real proof. They are arguing about things beyond nature, where their strong opinions can’t grab or hold onto anything solid. No matter how much they fight, the ideas they break apart come right back together quickly, like heroes in myths who keep fighting without real harm, just for fun.

But there’s also no good reason to be totally doubtful of pure reason either. You could say pure reason should stay neutral in all arguments.

Trying to make reason fight itself, giving it reasons to argue both sides, and then watching it struggle without helping isn’t fair or smart. It seems mean and unkind. However, because some tricky people brag and won’t listen to any criticism, the only option is to set one side’s claims against the other’s, so reason gets pushed to question itself and listen to the criticism. But for reason to stop there, admit it doesn’t know everything, and suggest that this ignorance should end all arguments is a useless idea. It doesn’t really help reason rest peacefully. Instead, it just wakes reason up from its easy beliefs so it can look more carefully at its own situation.

Even though this doubtful way of stepping back from endless arguments might seem like a shortcut to lasting peace in philosophy—or the “best path” recommended by those who don’t care much about these deep questions—I think it’s important to show what this way of thinking really means.

It’s impossible for pure reason to be completely satisfied if it’s divided against itself. Realizing you don’t know everything shouldn’t stop your questions. Instead, it should encourage you to keep looking for answers.
