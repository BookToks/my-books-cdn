Proofs that a highest being exists always come to an end, and there’s no reason to go any further beyond it. Even in the most basic polytheistic beliefs around the world, you can see a few hints of the idea of one God. People got to this idea not by thinking deeply but just by a natural way of understanding slowly becoming clearer.

There are only three ways to try to prove God’s existence using reason.

All the ways to try start either from clear experiences and how our world works, moving up to the highest cause outside the world; or from unclear experiences, just from knowing something exists; or from no experience at all, just from ideas alone.

The first way is called the physico-theological proof, the second is the cosmological proof, and the third is the ontological proof. There are no other ways, and there can’t be.

I will show that reason doesn’t do much better on the first way (using experience) than on the last way (using pure ideas), and that trying to go beyond what we can sense just by thinking doesn’t work. But I will look at these proofs in the opposite order to how people usually think about them. Even though experience suggested these ideas, it’s really the pure ideas of reason that guide these efforts and set the goal. So, I will start by looking at the ontological proof and then see if adding experience helps make the proof stronger.

From what we’ve said before, it’s clear that the idea of a being that must exist is just a pure idea of reason, not something proved to be real just because reason says we need it. This idea only points to a kind of perfect completeness we can’t actually reach, and really just helps set limits to what we can understand.
