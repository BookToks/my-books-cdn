The idea of time is something we just naturally understand, like a feeling we get right away. It’s called a "pure intuition" because it’s both unique and something we always experience. We don’t learn about time from other experiences; instead, time is something we assume is there before we even notice anything else. Kant talks about this again in his book, explaining it more clearly.

Next, Kant says that time is continuous. This means that between any two moments, no matter how close, there’s always another moment in between. Time doesn’t have separate pieces; it just keeps going smoothly.

He also explains that time isn’t a real thing out there, like an object or a substance. There are two parts to this idea. One is positive: we need to understand time on its own because it helps us know when things happen at the same time or one after another. This means we have a pure idea of time that isn’t based on any specific experience. But this doesn’t mean time isn’t real or doesn’t exist outside our minds.

For the second, negative part, Kant gives two reasons why time isn’t a real, physical thing. One reason is against the idea that time is an absolute thing, like what Newton and some English philosophers thought. That idea is silly. The other reason is against Leibniz’s idea that time comes from how we see things related to each other. If time were just something we figure out from experience, then we couldn’t be sure about math and science rules, which doesn’t make sense. Kant doesn’t explain all the details of this argument yet.

Finally, Kant says that if we think about time by itself, it’s just imaginary. But since time is the basic way we experience everything happening, it is very real and important. It’s the first rule for how we sense the world.

Kant says similar things about space. He says we don’t get the idea of space just by looking at things outside us. We only understand space because we think of things being somewhere different from where we are. So, space isn’t something we learn from experience; it’s part of how we understand experience.

Like time, space is a single idea. All parts of space belong to one big, endless space, not just little pieces of it.
