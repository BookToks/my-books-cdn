When we think about ideas that come before experience, some of them show us something that exists, while others just show us something that doesn’t exist. The word "not" is used in logic to show the opposite of a thought, but it doesn’t really change what the idea itself means. For example, saying "non-mortal" doesn’t tell us that something doesn’t exist; it just changes how we think about it. 

A special kind of negation, called transcendental negation, means that something really doesn’t exist. This is the opposite of transcendental affirmation, which means something definitely exists. We call this existence "reality" because only through it can we say that things are real. Negation, in this case, means a total lack of something.

You can’t understand what something is not unless you know what it is. For example, a person who has been blind from birth can’t imagine darkness because they’ve never seen light. Someone who has never been rich doesn’t really understand what poverty is. If you don’t know something, you can’t even understand your own ignorance. So, all ideas about what something is not come from ideas about what it is.

If our mind works by using a basic foundation that holds all the possible traits of things, this foundation is like the idea of everything that exists. True negations are just limits, and they only make sense because they relate to this unlimited total of everything.

Astronomers have taught us amazing things, but the most important lesson is how much we still don’t know. This huge gap in our knowledge should change how we use our reason and what we try to achieve with it.
