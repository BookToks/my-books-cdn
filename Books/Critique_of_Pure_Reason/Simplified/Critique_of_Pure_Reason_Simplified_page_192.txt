Time is something that makes all appearances possible. The things we see might disappear, but time itself can’t be taken away because it’s what lets those things happen in the first place.

There are basic rules about time that we know must be true before we even experience anything. Time has only one direction: different moments don’t happen at the same time, but one after another. This is different from space, where different places exist at the same time. We can’t learn these rules just by looking around because then we wouldn’t be sure they always apply. Instead, these rules are what make experience possible at all.

Time isn’t just a general idea we think about; it’s a pure way we sense things. Different moments are all part of the same time. When we think about time, it’s like seeing one object that shows us these moments. The idea that different times can’t happen together doesn’t come from a general idea but from how we actually experience time.

Time goes on forever because any specific amount of time only exists because it’s limited by the whole of time. So, time itself must be unlimited. But when we think about parts of time or how long something lasts, we can only understand that by limiting it. We can’t understand all of time just by ideas because ideas only cover parts of it; we need direct experience to really get it.

I’ve already talked about some of these ideas in another section, but I want to add more about how change fits into this.
