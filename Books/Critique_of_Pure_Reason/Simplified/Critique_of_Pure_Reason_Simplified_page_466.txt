From all this, we can see that rational psychology starts from a simple misunderstanding. The unity of consciousness, which supports the basic categories, is wrongly seen as a clear image of the subject as an object, and the category of substance is applied to it. But this unity is just the unity of thinking, and it doesn’t give us any actual object. So, the category of substance, which always needs a real object, can’t be used here, and that means this subject can’t be truly known.

Also, the subject where the idea of time first comes from can’t decide its own existence in time. If it can’t exist in time, then it can’t be defined as a thinking being through categories either. The phrase "I think" is an experience-based statement and includes "I exist." But I can’t say "Everything that thinks exists," because then thinking would make all beings necessary, which isn’t true. So, my existence isn’t something I can prove just by saying "I think," as Descartes believed. Instead, "I think" and "I exist" are the same thing.

This shows that "I think" is a vague experience or perception, meaning it proves that sensation (which belongs to our ability to feel) supports this idea of existing. But this comes before we experience and understand objects through categories related to time. Here, existence isn’t a category by itself; it’s connected to an object we understand and want to know if it exists outside our idea of it.

A vague perception only means something real was given, but not as an appearance or a thing in itself, just something that truly exists, shown by the statement "I think." It’s important to know that when I say "I think" is an experience-based statement, I don’t mean the "I" here is just an experience. It’s more like pure thinking, part of all thinking. But without any experience to give content to this thinking, the act of "I think" wouldn’t happen. So, experience is just what helps us use our pure thinking ability.
