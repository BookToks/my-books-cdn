When we understand something happening, like an event, we think about how causes and effects are connected. This idea applies to everything we experience.

Categories are basic ideas that set rules for how things appear to us, meaning they guide how nature looks as a whole. These categories don’t come from nature itself and aren’t based on it, so the question is: how can nature follow these rules without the rules coming from nature? Here’s the answer.

It’s not surprising that the laws about how things appear in nature match the way our mind works to organize information. Just like things look a certain way because of how we sense them, the rules about appearances exist because of how our understanding connects everything. The laws don’t exist by themselves but depend on the mind that understands them, just like appearances depend on having senses.

Things in themselves would have laws even if no one understood them. But appearances are just how things look to us, not what they really are. Since appearances are just our mind’s way of showing things, the only rules they follow are those made by how our mind connects what we sense.

The part of our mind that links what we sense is called imagination. Imagination depends on understanding to keep everything connected and on our senses to notice details. Because all possible experiences depend on how we connect what we sense, and this connection depends on basic rules called categories, everything we ever experience follows these categories. So nature, as we see it, follows these rules because they are the foundation of how things must appear.

But just having understanding alone isn’t enough to explain this fully.
