It can’t be experience because the rule we're talking about adds new ideas to old ones in a way that’s more general than experience can give us. It also shows that this has to be true, not just something we learn from experience, but from ideas alone.

The main goal of what we know before experience depends on these kinds of rules that add new information. Rules that just explain what we already know are important, but they only help us understand ideas clearly enough to build something new.

There is a bit of a mystery here. To really understand how we can know things before experience, we need to figure out why these new ideas make sense and what makes them possible. We don’t just want to say this kind of knowledge exists; we want to fully understand it and how it fits into a system with clear rules and limits.

From all this, we get the idea of a special kind of science that studies pure reason. Pure knowledge means it’s not mixed with anything outside itself. Absolute pure knowledge means it has nothing at all from experience or feelings—only ideas from the start.

Reason is the ability that gives us these ideas before experience. So, pure reason has the rules for knowing things completely from ideas alone. A system of pure reason would be a collection of all these rules that let us get this kind of knowledge and actually use it.

If people in the past had asked these questions, it would have made a big difference and stopped many wrong ideas about pure reason.
