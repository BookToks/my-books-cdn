Experience is the first thing our mind creates when it works with the raw information we get from our senses. Because of this, experience is the first lesson we learn, and it keeps giving us new things to discover. This means people in the future will always find new information from what they experience.

But experience isn’t the only way our mind understands things. Experience can tell us what is happening, but it can’t prove that things have to be that way and not different. So, experience doesn’t give us knowledge that is always true everywhere. Our reason wants this kind of sure knowledge, but experience doesn’t fully satisfy it.

True universal knowledge has to be clear and certain on its own, without depending on experience. This kind of knowledge is called “a priori.” On the other hand, knowledge that comes only from experience is called “a posteriori” or “empirical.”

Even in our experiences, some knowledge comes from these a priori ideas, while some just help us connect what we sense.
