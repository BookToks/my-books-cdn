Immanuel Kant's book, the Critique of Pure Reason, is one of the most important works in Western philosophy. It was published in May 1781 when Kant was 57 years old and was later revised six years after. This book was the result of 30 years of Kant’s private work and started almost 20 more years of his public philosophical ideas. Since it was first published, many scholars have studied it and it has inspired many creative philosophers. To fully explain the book’s impact would be like telling the whole history of philosophy after Kant, which we won’t do here. After summarizing the book’s structure and ideas, this introduction will briefly explain how the book developed from Kant’s first work in 1755 to the first edition in 1781 and its revision in 1787.

The main idea of the Critique is explained in its plan. At the end of Kant’s second critique, called the Critique of Practical Reason from 1788, he wrote, "Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe the more often and more enduringly reflection is occupied with them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me." This sentence could describe almost all of Kant’s philosophy, especially the Critique of Pure Reason. Early in his career, Kant wanted to solve some of the biggest scientific questions of his time and set the basic rules for how we can truly understand the world, like understanding the "starry heavens."

At the same time, Kant wanted to show that human freedom isn’t against modern science. He believed that freedom is necessary for morality and is the most important value that moral law supports and promotes.
