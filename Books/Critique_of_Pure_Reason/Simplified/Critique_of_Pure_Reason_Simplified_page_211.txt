Part II. Transcendental Logic sometimes contradicts itself. But the rules it uses only deal with the form of truth, which means how we think in general, and in that way, they are totally correct but not enough.

Even if an idea follows all the rules of logic and doesn’t contradict itself, it can still be wrong about what it’s actually talking about. The basic rule for truth in logic is that an idea must follow the general rules of understanding and reason. This rule is necessary for any truth, but logic alone can’t find mistakes that come from the actual content or facts.

General logic breaks down how we understand and reason into smaller parts and shows these parts as rules to judge our ideas. This part of logic is like an analysis, and it works as a way to check if an idea is logical or not. You have to check if the form of an idea follows these rules before you can look at the content to see if it’s true about the object.

But just because an idea follows logical form doesn’t mean it’s true about the real world. So, no one should try to judge or say things about objects using only logic without first having solid information from outside logic. After that, logic can help organize and check how the information fits together. Still, many people get tricked by the idea that if you can make your ideas sound logical, they must be true, even if the actual facts are weak or missing. Because of this, general logic, which should only be a tool for judging ideas, has sometimes been wrongly used as if it can create true statements by itself. This misused version of general logic is called dialectic.

In ancient times, the word dialectic meant something different, but it showed how it was used as a kind of logic for illusions. It was a sneaky skill to make ignorance or tricks look like truth by copying the careful style of real logic and using clever arguments to dress up empty claims.

So, it’s a good warning to remember that general logic, when used as a tool to produce knowledge on its own, is actually a logic of illusion.
