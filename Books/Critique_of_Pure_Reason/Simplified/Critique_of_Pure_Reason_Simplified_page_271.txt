Our inner sense is like a part of us that feels things happening inside, but it’s not the same as apperception. Apperception is how we put together all the different things we sense into one clear idea. It helps us understand all kinds of objects by combining what we see or feel. Inner sense just gives us the basic form of what we sense, but it doesn’t organize these feelings into a clear picture. To actually understand something, we need the imagination to help combine these parts into something we can recognize.

We see this all the time with ourselves. For example, we can’t think about a line without imagining drawing it. We can’t think about a circle without imagining its shape. To picture three dimensions, we have to imagine three lines meeting at one point. Even when we think about time, we picture it like a straight line, showing how one moment follows another. We do this by paying attention to how our imagination connects different moments inside us.

Motion, when we think about it inside ourselves (not just how objects move), is how we put together different parts of space in order. If we just think about this process itself, without the objects, it creates the idea of one thing happening after another. Our understanding doesn’t just find these connections inside us; it actually makes them by affecting our inner sense. But it’s tricky to explain how the “I” that thinks and the “I” that feels things inside are the same, even though we can imagine other kinds of feelings too.

Also, motion as the movement of objects isn’t something we can know just by thinking; we learn it through experience. But motion as the way we connect things in space in our mind belongs both to geometry and to how we understand everything deeply.
