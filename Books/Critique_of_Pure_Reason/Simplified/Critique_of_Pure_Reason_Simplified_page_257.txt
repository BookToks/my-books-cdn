Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. I. Ch. II <A> consciousness precedes all cognition of the object, as its intellectual A I 30 form, and itself constitutes an priori formal cognition of all objects a in general, insofar as they are thought (categories). Their synthesis through the pure imagination, the unity of all representations in rela­ tion to original apperception, precede all empirical cognition. Pure concepts of the understanding are therefore possible, indeed necessary priori in relation to experience, only because our cognition has to do a with nothing but appearances, whose possibility lies in ourselves, whose connection and unity (in the representation of an object) is en­ countered merely in us, and thus must precede all experience and first make it possible as far as its form is concerned. And from this ground, the only possible one among all, our deduction of the categories has been conducted.
