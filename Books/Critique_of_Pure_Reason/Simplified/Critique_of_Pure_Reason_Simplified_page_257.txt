Consciousness comes before we understand any object. It is like the basic shape or form of thinking, and it gives us a way to understand all objects in general, as long as we think about them using categories.

Our mind puts all the pieces together through pure imagination. This means that before we experience anything, our mind unites all our thoughts with our self-awareness. This happens before we learn anything from real life.

Pure ideas in our mind are possible and even necessary before we have any experience because we only understand appearances. These appearances exist in us, and their connection and unity happen only in our mind. So, this must happen before any experience, and it is what makes experience possible in the first place.

Using this idea, we can explain where our basic categories of understanding come from. This explanation is the only one that works.
