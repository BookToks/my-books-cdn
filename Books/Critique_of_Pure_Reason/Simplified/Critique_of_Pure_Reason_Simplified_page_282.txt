Examples are really useful because they help us get better at making good decisions.

But sometimes, examples can actually make it harder to understand things clearly. This is because examples don’t always fit the rule perfectly. They can also make us rely too much on specific cases instead of understanding the general idea behind the rule. So, we might start treating rules like simple formulas instead of important principles.

Examples are like training wheels for judgment. People who aren’t naturally good at judging things often need them. 

General logic can’t really teach us exactly how to judge well, but transcendental logic is different. It helps improve judgment by giving clear rules for using pure understanding. Philosophy might not help much in learning new knowledge, but it’s useful for avoiding mistakes when we use the few pure ideas we have. Its role is mostly to warn us about errors.

What’s special about transcendental philosophy is that, besides giving us the rules, it also shows us the exact situations where these rules apply. This is why it’s better than most other teaching methods (except math). It focuses on clear cases where rules can be used, which helps us learn better.
