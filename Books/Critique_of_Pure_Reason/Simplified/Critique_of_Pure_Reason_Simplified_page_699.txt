There are three steps when you believe something is true: having an opinion, believing, and knowing.

Having an opinion means you think something might be true, but you know you don’t have enough proof. Believing means you think something is true based on some reasons, but you’re still not 100% sure. Knowing means you are completely sure because you have enough proof for yourself and for everyone else.

When you feel sure for yourself, that’s called conviction. When you are sure for everyone, that’s called certainty.

I won’t explain these simple ideas more.

You should never have an opinion without knowing something that connects your idea to the truth. This connection must be certain, not just a guess. If you only have opinions, then it’s just imagination without any real link to truth.

In pure reason, you can’t just have an opinion. Since pure reason doesn’t rely on experience but on what must be true beforehand, you need complete certainty to find the truth. So, it’s silly to have opinions in math—you either know the answer or you say nothing.

The same goes for moral rules. You shouldn’t act just because you think something might be allowed, you must know it’s allowed.

When using reason to understand things beyond experience, having an opinion isn’t enough, but knowing is too much to expect. So, in pure thinking, we can’t really judge because the reasons we have aren’t strong enough or shared equally with others.

But when it comes to practical things, it’s okay to believe something that isn’t completely proven. This can be for skills or for moral reasons. Skills are for flexible goals, but moral reasons are for absolutely necessary goals.

When you want to reach a goal, the way to get there becomes necessary if you don’t know any other way. It’s enough for you if you don’t know a better way, but it’s enough for everyone only if you’re sure no one else knows a better way.
