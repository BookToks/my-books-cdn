Critique of all speculative theology them that unity which they can have in their greatest possible extension, i.e., in relation to the totality of series; the understanding does not look to this totality at all, but only to the connection through which series of conditions always come about according to concepts. Thus reason really has as object only the understanding and its purposive applica- A644/B672 tion, and just as the understanding unites the manifold into an object" through concepts, so reason on its side unites the manifold of concepts through ideas by positing a certain collective unity as the goal of the understanding's actions, which are otherwise concerned only with distributive unity.
 
 Accordingly, I assert: the transcendental ideas are never of constitu­ tive use, so that the concepts of certain objects would thereby be given, and in case one so understands them, they are merely sophistical (dia­ lectical) concepts. On the contrary, however, they have an excellent and indispensably necessary regulative use, namely that of directing the un­ derstanding to a certain goal respecting which the lines of direction of all its rules converge at one point, which, although it is only an idea (focus imaginarius) -i.e., a point from which the concepts of the under­ standing do not really proceed, since it lies entirely outside the bounds of possible experience -nonetheless still serves to obtain for these con­ cepts the greatest unity alongside the greatest extension. Now of course it is from this that there arises the deception, as if these lines of direc­ tion were shot outb from an object lying outside the field of possible empirical cognition (just as objectsC are seen behind the surface of a mirror); yet this illusion (which can be prevented from deceiving) is nevertheless indispensably necessary if besides the objects before our A64S/B673 eyes we want to see those that lie far in the background, i.e., when, in our case, the understanding wants to go beyond every given experience (beyond this part of the whole of possible experience), and hence wants to take the measure of its greatest possible and uttermost extension.
 
 If we survey the cognitions of our understanding in their entire range, then we find that what reason quite uniquely prescribes and seeks to bring about concerning it is the systematic in cognition, i.e., its interconnection based on one principle.d This unity of reason always presupposes an idea, namely that of the form of a whole of cognition, which precedes the determinate cognition of the parts and contains the conditions for determining a priori the place of each part and its relaa Object b The text reads "ausgeschlossen ...w aren" (were excluded). Editors have amended the text at this point in various ways. We follow Erdmann, substituting "ausgeschossen ...w aren"; a different but also eligible possibility is "aus geschlossen" (inferred from).
