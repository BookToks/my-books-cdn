Criticism of all guesswork about God tries to find the biggest possible connection, meaning how everything fits together in a complete series. But understanding doesn’t look at the whole series. It only focuses on how things are connected through ideas. So, reason really only deals with understanding and how it is used.

Just like understanding groups many things into one object using ideas, reason groups many ideas together by creating bigger ideas that show a goal for understanding. Understanding usually focuses on small parts, but reason tries to see the big picture.

I say that the big ideas that go beyond experience don’t actually give us real knowledge about things. If you think they do, that’s just tricking yourself. Instead, these big ideas are very useful because they guide understanding towards a goal. This goal helps bring the most unity and the widest view to our ideas.

But this can also cause confusion, because it looks like these big ideas come from something outside what we can experience, kind of like seeing things behind a mirror. This is an illusion, but it’s necessary if we want to think beyond what we can actually see or experience. It helps us imagine the biggest possible view of everything.

When we look at everything we understand, reason wants to organize all knowledge into a system based on one main principle. This unity of reason always needs a big idea—a whole structure of knowledge—that comes before knowing the details. This big idea helps us figure out where each part fits in the whole.
