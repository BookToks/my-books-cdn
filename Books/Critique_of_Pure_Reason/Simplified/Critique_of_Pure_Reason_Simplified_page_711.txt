Chapter 3 talks about how people arguing over who made the best discoveries has made their science look bad to others and even to themselves.

Pure knowledge that comes before any experience, called a priori knowledge, has a special way it works in our minds. Metaphysics is the part of philosophy that tries to organize this kind of knowledge.

Metaphysics, especially the part called metaphysics of nature, looks at everything that exists based on a priori ideas, not just what should exist. It has two parts: transcendental philosophy and the study of pure reason's "physiology."

Transcendental philosophy studies understanding and reason itself, focusing on all concepts related to objects in general without assuming the objects actually exist. The physiology part looks at nature, meaning all the objects we can experience, either through our senses or in some other way, but only through reason.

When using reason to study nature, there are two ways: one that stays within what we can experience (immanent), and one that goes beyond what we can experience (transcendent). The immanent approach studies nature as we see it, based on our senses and a priori rules. The transcendent approach tries to understand the whole world or even God, going beyond experience.

Immanent physiology focuses on nature as all the things we sense, but under the rules that make experience possible. There are two kinds of objects for this: things outside us (like physical stuff) and things inside us (like our mind or soul), which is thinking nature.

The study of physical nature is called physics, but since it uses only a priori knowledge, itâ€™s called rational physics.
