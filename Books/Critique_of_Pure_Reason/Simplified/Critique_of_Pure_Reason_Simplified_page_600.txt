Criticism of all speculative theology says that if we try to fix the problem of not having complete proof by using just an idea of the highest perfection and original necessity, we could only do this if we were given special permission. But we can’t demand this kind of proof as something absolutely certain.

So, the physico-theological proof might help support other proofs (if there were any) by linking ideas with what we can see and experience. But by itself, it mainly prepares our mind for understanding theology, giving it a clear and natural direction. It can’t finish the job alone.

From this, we can see that deep questions need deep answers, meaning answers that come from pure ideas without any experience mixed in. But this question is clearly about something new and needs us to think beyond anything we’ve ever experienced—like the existence of a being that matches just an idea in our minds, which no real experience can fully explain.

According to the proofs we talked about earlier, all true knowledge before experience is only possible because it shows the basic rules for what we could experience. So, all the rules only apply to things we can actually experience or see. That means trying to use pure thought to prove theology doesn’t really get us anywhere.

But if someone wants to doubt all these old proofs instead of losing faith in them, that’s fine. Still, they need to explain how and why they can confidently believe in something beyond all possible experience just by using ideas. I’m not interested in hearing new proofs or better versions of old ones.

There isn’t much difference here because all speculative proofs really boil down to one main proof—the ontological proof. I’m not afraid of arguments from someone who strongly believes in reason without needing experience. Even though I’m not looking for a fight, I’m ready to find mistakes in any such arguments and stop them from being convincing. But this won’t completely stop people who like dogmatic beliefs from hoping for better proofs.

So, I only ask for one fair thing: to show a general reason, based on how human understanding works and all other ways we know things, for starting to extend our knowledge purely through reason alone.
