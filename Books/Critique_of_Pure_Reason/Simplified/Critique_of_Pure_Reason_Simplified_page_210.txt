The old and famous question that made logicians stuck and confused, forcing them to either go in circles or admit they didn’t know, is this: What is truth? People agree that truth means a thought matches the thing it’s about, but they want to know how you can always tell if a thought is true.

It’s smart to know what questions to ask. If a question is silly or asks for something useless, it just makes the person asking look bad and can trick others into giving silly answers. Imagine someone trying to milk a goat while another person is holding a sieve to catch the milk—it’s pointless and funny.

If truth means a thought matches its object, then that object has to be different from others. A thought is false if it doesn’t match the object it’s about, even if it’s true for some other things. Now, a rule for truth that works for every thought, no matter what it’s about, would ignore what the thought is about. But truth is all about the content, so it’s impossible and silly to look for one sign that shows all thoughts are true. Since the content of a thought is its matter, it makes no sense to ask for one general sign of truth for all thought content.

But when we only look at the form of thinking (ignoring the content), it’s clear that logic, which explains the general rules of understanding, must give us ways to check if thinking is true. If something breaks these rules, it’s false, because then the understanding breaks its own rules and gets confused.
