Reflection doesn’t mean looking at objects themselves to get ideas from them. Instead, it’s the way we get ready in our minds to figure out how we can come up with ideas.

It’s being aware of how the things we think about relate to the ways we know things. This helps us understand how those things connect to each other.

The first question before we think more about what we see or imagine is: which part of our mind is putting these ideas together? Is it our understanding or our senses?

Sometimes we believe something just because we’re used to it or because we want to believe it. But if we didn’t think carefully about it before or after, we just assume it came from understanding.

Not every idea needs to be checked carefully. For example, we know right away that there can only be one straight line between two points. We don’t need more proof than that.

But all ideas and comparisons do need some reflection—that means we have to figure out which part of our mind is making those ideas.
