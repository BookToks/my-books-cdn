It is about the following points: First, that the ideas should be pure and not based on experience. Second, that they belong to thinking and understanding, not to feelings or senses. Third, that these ideas are basic and clearly different from those made by combining them. Fourth, that the list of these ideas is complete and covers all of pure understanding.

Now, you can’t just guess that a science is complete by adding things up roughly. To be sure, you need a clear idea of all the knowledge that understanding has beforehand. This happens by sorting the ideas and connecting them in a system. Pure understanding separates itself completely from everything based on experience or feelings. It works alone and doesn’t need anything outside itself.

Because of this, all its knowledge makes a system that you can understand as one whole idea. How complete and organized this system is can show if all the parts of knowledge in it are correct and real. This part of transcendental logic has two books: the first one has the ideas of pure understanding, and the second one has its rules.
