 Just for this reason we are also justified in thinking of the world­ cause in the idea not only according to a subtle anthropomorphism (without which nothing at all could be thought about itb), namely as a being that has understanding, liking and disliking, and desire and will in conformity with them, etc., but also in ascribing to that being infi­ nite perfection far transcending what we could justify on the basis of our empirical acquaintance with the world-order. For the regulative law of systematic unity would have us study nature as if systematic and purposive unity together with the greatest possible manifoldness were to be encountered everywhere to infinity. For although we may light on or reach only a little of this perfection of the world, yet it belongs to the legislation of our reason to seek for it and presume it everywhere, and it must always be advantageous for us, and can never become disadvantageous, to institute our consideration of nature in accordance A 70I I B7 29 with this principle.c But under this way of representing the idea of a highest world-author as a ground, it is clear that I ground things not on the existence or acquaintance with this being, but only on its idea; thus I really derive nothing from this being, but only from the idea of it, i.e., from the nature of the things in the world in accordance with such an idea. It also seems to have been a certain, though to be sure undeveloped, consciousness of the genuine use of this rational concept of ours which occasioned the modest and reasonabled language used by philosophers of all ages in talking of the wisdom and providence of nature, and of divine wisdom, as if they were expressions with the same meaninge -preferring, indeed, the first expression as long as they have to do merely with speculative reason, because this restrains us from the presumption of making a bigger assertion than we are warranted in making, and at the same time points reason back to its proper field, which is nature.
 
 Thus pure reason, which initially seemed to promise us nothing less than an extension of our knowledge! beyond all the boundaries of ex­ perience, if we understand it rightly contains nothing but regulative a In Kant's text, this noun is preceded by der, an article that is either genitive or dative, leaving the verb "regard" with no direct object; with Erdmann, we read die, putting this noun in the accusative.
