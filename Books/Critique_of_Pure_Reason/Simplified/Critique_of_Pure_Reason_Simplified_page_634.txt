Criticism of all ideas about God and the universe that are just guesses shows that these ideas are connected like causes and effects.

Because of this, it makes sense to think of the cause of the world not just like a human (with thoughts, feelings, and wishes), but also as something perfect beyond anything we know from the world around us. Our reason tells us to study nature as if it has a perfect and organized plan everywhere, even if we can only see a little bit of this perfection.

Even though we don’t fully understand this perfect world cause, we should still look for it and assume it exists everywhere. Doing this helps us understand nature better and never hurts us.

When we think of this highest cause, we don’t base it on proof it exists, but only on the idea of it. So, we don’t get actual knowledge from this being, but from the idea itself and how things in the world fit this idea.

Philosophers have always talked carefully about nature’s wisdom or divine wisdom. They use these ideas to remind us to stay humble and focus on what we can understand about nature, instead of making bold claims about things we can’t prove.

So, pure reason, which at first seemed like it could give us knowledge beyond what we experience, actually only gives us rules to guide how we think about nature.
