When the body dies, it stops moving in ways that keep it alive. But what about the soul? Where does it go? The body is broken, and the parts left don’t work together like before. There are no senses or feelings anymore, so the soul can’t experience anything. Does that mean everything inside is empty and lifeless? Are all feelings, thoughts, wants, and fears gone without a trace?

“No way,” said Cebes. “That would mean total destruction. And nature doesn’t work that way.”

A long time ago, people said that natural actions have a beginning, middle, and end—they take time to happen. Even if it’s a very short time, things must happen one after another. For nature to cause something, it has to happen gradually, step by step. If something happens instantly without any preparation, it’s not natural and can’t be made by natural powers.

These ideas were known even in ancient times. They show up clearly in Plato’s thoughts about changes and how one state turns into another. So, I wanted to explain these ideas clearly to my readers, like Plato did, but in a way people today can understand. These ideas make sense and help us think about how the body and soul change, which is important when we talk about life, death, and whether the soul lives forever.

Kant himself said something similar when he explained the ideas of a thinker named Meier, who was a logician Kant used in his studies.

Descartes, another famous thinker, said we can’t just say “I exist” because “I think” based on a general rule like “anything that thinks exists.” Kant agrees with this idea.

There are also other philosophers like Leibniz and Tetens who talked about the soul and human nature. Some divided psychology into parts, and one part starts by proving the soul exists, using Descartes’ idea that thinking proves existence.
