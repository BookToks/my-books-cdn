The rule of pure reason says there’s no real reason based on experience to stop dividing things further. But the parts you find during this ongoing division are already given by experience before you divide more. This means the division can keep going forever. 

On the other hand, the family tree of a person isn’t fully given by any experience you can have. You can trace back from one generation to the next, but you never find a first, unconditioned ancestor. The ancestors you might find aren’t all given at once by experience. So, this tracing back doesn’t go on forever by splitting what you already have but goes on an unknown distance, always looking for more ancestors, which are only known in relation to others.

In both cases—the endless division and the uncertain tracing back—the series of conditions isn’t actually given as infinite in the object itself. We don’t have things as they really are, only appearances, and these conditions are given only during the process of tracing them back. So, the question isn’t how long this series really is—whether it’s finite or infinite—because it doesn’t exist by itself. The real question is how we should do this tracing back based on experience, and how far we should keep going.

There’s an important difference about the rule to follow here. If the whole thing has already been given by experience, then you can go back infinitely through its parts. But if the whole thing isn’t given yet, and you only find it by tracing back through experience, then you can say only that you can keep going to higher parts forever. 

In the first case, you can say: there are always more parts already given by experience than I have found. In the second case, you can only say: I can keep looking for more parts because no part is given as totally independent, so a higher part might exist and it makes sense to look for it. 

In the first case, you have to find more parts. In the second case, you always have to keep looking for more parts because no experience sets a final limit. If you don’t have a clear end to your tracing back, you can’t say your search is complete. And if you do have a clear limit, that limit isn’t part of your trace back series itself, so you have to keep searching until you reach it, and maybe keep going even further.
