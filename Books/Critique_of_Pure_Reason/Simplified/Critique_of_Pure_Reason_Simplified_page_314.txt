Only things that stay the same over time can be said to last or have a real length of time, which we call duration.

If things just happened one after another without anything staying the same, there would be no sense of time. Time itself can’t be directly seen, so the thing that stays the same is what makes time noticeable. This unchanging thing is the base for how we combine what we see into experiences. All changes and existence happen as different ways this lasting thing shows up.

In everything we see, the thing that stays the same is the actual object, or substance. Anything that changes is just how this substance exists or shows itself differently.

People have always believed, even without thinking deeply, that something must stay the same under all the changes we see. Philosophers say that the substance stays the same while only its features change. But no one has really tried to prove this idea properly. It’s often just accepted as true without question.

Saying substance lasts is kind of obvious because that’s what lets us call something a substance in the first place. But to prove that something always stays the same in all appearances is really hard and can’t be done just by thinking about it. It has to be proven by what can happen in experience, since it’s about how things are possible.

The proof comes from the fact that we can only notice substances by their changes. If we can’t see something except through its changes, then we can only understand how long it lasts by looking at other things, like how I know I exist because I think. But my own lasting existence isn’t something that can be proven in this way.

Also, there is no amount of substance in the soul that can be measured or said to last by any property.
