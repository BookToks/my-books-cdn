So in this idea, thinking isn’t just random anymore. It also involves understanding what I see or feel, which means my mind is working with what I experience. Now, my thinking self has to figure out how to use logic to understand things like substance and cause, not just to think about myself as an object, but to really know what kind of being I am. But this is impossible because what I feel inside me only shows appearances, not the true existence of my pure self. It only helps me understand what I experience.

But imagine if, not from experience but from some unchanging rules about our existence, I could assume that I create my own existence by myself, without needing experience. Then I would see a kind of freedom that lets me decide my own being without needing what I feel inside. Here, I would realize that inside my awareness of existing, there is something built-in that can shape my existence. But this existence can only be understood through my senses, related to an inner ability connected to a world I can only imagine.

Still, this wouldn’t help the study of the mind much. Because even if I have this amazing ability that first shows me the idea of moral law, I would only have a way to understand my existence through ideas that need to be given to me by my senses. So I’d end up right where rational psychology started—needing what I sense to make my ideas about things like substance and cause meaningful. But those senses can never take me beyond the limits of what I can experience.
