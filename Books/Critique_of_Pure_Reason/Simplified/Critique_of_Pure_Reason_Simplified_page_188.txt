When I have certain feelings or sensations, I can think of them as happening somewhere outside of me, in different places. To do this, I need to already have an idea of space. So, the idea of space doesn’t come from what I experience outside, but instead, my experience of the outside world is only possible because I already understand space.

Space is something we must understand before we experience anything outside ourselves. We can’t imagine a world without space, even if we think there might be nothing in it. Space is not something that depends on what we see or feel; it’s the basic way we understand where things are.

Space isn’t just a general idea about how things relate to each other. It’s a pure way of seeing or imagining. There is only one space, and when we talk about many spaces, we really mean parts of the same one space. These parts don’t come before the whole space; they only make sense inside the one big space. Space is one whole thing, and the idea of many spaces just comes from breaking that one space into smaller parts.

All the rules of geometry, like how in a triangle the sum of two sides is always longer than the third side, don’t come from just thinking about lines and triangles. They come from this way of seeing space, and we know these rules are always true without needing to check by experience.

Space is thought of as something that goes on forever. Usually, a concept is an idea that includes many possible examples, but it doesn’t actually hold an infinite number of them inside itself. Space is different because all parts of it, no matter how many or how small, exist at the same time. This means the idea of space is not just a concept but a special kind of immediate understanding we have before any experience.
