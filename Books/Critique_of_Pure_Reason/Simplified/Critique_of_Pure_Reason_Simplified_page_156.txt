When we think about causes, the idea of cause is actually different from just thinking about what usually happens. The cause isn’t included in the general idea of what happens. So, how can I say something new about what usually happens and understand the idea of cause as part of it, even though it’s not actually in that general idea?

What is this unknown thing that helps our mind believe it can find something new beyond the original idea, something that seems connected but isn’t really part of it? It can’t be just from experience, because the rule we use adds more general ideas than experience can, and it shows these ideas are necessary, meaning they come from thinking alone, not from experience.

The main goal of our thinking is based on these kinds of ideas that add new information, called synthetic judgments. Analytic judgments are important for understanding ideas clearly, but synthetic judgments help us learn new things.

Synthetic judgments that come before experience are the foundation of all science based on reason.

All math judgments are synthetic. This fact seems to have been missed by many who study human thinking, even though it’s very important and clearly true.

People used to think math just follows the rule that a statement can’t contradict itself, so they believed all math principles come from that rule. But they were wrong. A synthetic statement can fit with the rule of no contradictions only if it’s based on another synthetic statement. It can’t come from that rule alone.
