When we try to understand how things happen in time, we have to put all the rules together in order. This means that what happens next must come after what happened before, following a general rule. This creates a series of events that our mind can understand as connected and necessary, like the order we experience inside our own minds over time. Every event has to fit somewhere in this timeline.

So, when something happens, it’s a perception that could be part of an experience. It becomes real if I see it as an object that always fits into the order of events following a rule. This rule is about time: what comes before sets the condition for what happens next. This idea, called the principle of sufficient reason, is the reason we can understand how experiences happen one after another in time.

To prove this, we see that all the things we know through experience come from putting together different pieces in our imagination, one after the other. But the imagination itself doesn’t decide the order of these pieces; the order can go forwards or backwards. However, when we focus on the actual thing we are experiencing, the order is fixed. One event has to come before another, and if the first happens, the second must follow.

So, if I want to understand that something really happened, I have to think about it as a judgment. That means I believe the event follows another event in time, based on a rule. If I say something came before but the next event didn’t follow, it wouldn’t make sense.
