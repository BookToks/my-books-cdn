Understanding things clearly comes from using our mind in a healthy way. Even the most complicated thinking starts from simple ideas we already have. But when we think normally, we don’t notice all the different ideas happening in our heads. So, we can’t say that normal ideas are just based on what we see or sense. That’s because things like “right” or “wrong” don’t just appear like pictures. Instead, the idea of what is right is something our mind understands deeply and it guides how we act. 

On the other hand, when we see or feel something with our body, it’s only showing us an appearance or how we are affected by it. This is called sensibility. Sensibility is very different from truly understanding what something really is, even if we look closely at how it seems.

Some old philosophers, like Leibniz and Wolff, thought that the difference between what we sense and what we understand was just about logic or how clear our ideas are. But actually, this difference is much bigger. It has to do with where our knowledge comes from and what it includes. Through our senses, we don’t know what things really are at all. If we took away how we personally experience things, the objects we think we see wouldn’t exist anywhere. That’s because how things look to us depends on us, not on the things themselves. 

Usually, we know the difference between what always comes with how things appear to us and what only happens sometimes because of how our senses work. We say the first kind of knowledge shows the real object, but the second kind only shows how it looks. But this difference is only based on experience. If we forget that even our experience is just an appearance, we start to think we really know things as they are, when really we only know how they appear to us. Even the most careful study of things only deals with appearances, not the things themselves.
