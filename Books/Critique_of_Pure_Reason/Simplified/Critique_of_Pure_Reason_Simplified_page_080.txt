We can’t talk about everything here. Instead, after a few quick notes about changes in the Critique of Pure Reason found in the Prolegomena and Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, we’ll finish this introduction by explaining the main changes made in the second edition of the first Critique.

After a year without much attention, except for two friendly but unimportant reviews from Frankfurt and Greifswald, the Critique finally got its first serious review in 1782. This review appeared in a university journal from Göttingen, a school founded in 1737 by George I of England, who was also the ruler of Hanover. A group of philosophers there, led by J. G. H. Feder, were known for their focus on experience and observation. The review, which Feder shortened and changed from a more positive version by Christian Garve, was quite critical.

The published review skipped Garve’s clear explanation of Kant’s ideas and his good interpretation of why Kant thought synthetic a priori knowledge (knowledge that is both new and necessary) was possible, especially in math. Instead, it focused on three complaints.

First, it said Kant’s "transcendental idealism" was just a rewording of Berkeley’s idealism, which says everything we know is just sensations and we can’t know if objects really exist outside our minds. Second, it argued that Kant’s view couldn’t tell the difference between what’s real and what’s imagined or just possible. Third, it claimed Kant’s idea that pure reason must be replaced by practical reason for morality was pointless because morality is already based on common sense.

Kant had planned to write a shorter, easier version of his philosophy soon after the Critique came out, but this harsh review pushed him to act faster. In August 1783, he published the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics, where he directly answered some of these criticisms.

He explained that, unlike Berkeley, he didn’t deny the real existence of objects themselves, only the real existence of space and time as things. Because of this, he suggested calling his idea "formal" or "critical idealism" instead of transcendental idealism, to show his philosophy is about the way we understand objects, not whether they exist.

He also said his theory of understanding offers clear rules to tell the difference between real experiences and dreams or fantasies. So, his philosophy shouldn’t be seen as a kind of "higher" idealism, which he thought sounded like something made up or silly, but as a philosophy based firmly on real experience.
