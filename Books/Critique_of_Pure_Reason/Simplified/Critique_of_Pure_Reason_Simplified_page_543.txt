Before dividing something, it already has many parts. These parts are definite but endless. When you try to keep dividing forever, you end up confusing yourself because this endless division is seen as a series that never finishes, but at the same time, it is thought of as finished when you look at it as a whole.

This endless division just looks like a smooth, unbroken amount and is tied to how space is filled. The reason it can be divided endlessly is because of that. But when you think of something as made up of separate parts, the number of parts is fixed; it always equals a certain number.

Only experience can tell us how far the parts of a physical body can be divided. Even if we knew that there are no non-living parts, those parts at least have to be possible to experience. But how far you can divide appearances in general is not something experience can decide. Instead, it is a rule of reason not to think that the process of dividing what takes up space ever truly finishes.

When we showed the problem of pure reason using a table with all the transcendental ideas, we explained why the conflict happens and how to solve it. The solution was to say both opposing statements are false. We always showed that the conditions for something depended on space and time, which is how people usually understand things, and this was where the conflict came from.

In this way, all arguments about totality in a series of conditions were similar. There was always a series where each condition was connected to what it depended on, making the series uniform. The process of going back through these conditions was never thought to be complete. If it were, it would wrongly treat something continuous as if it were made of separate parts.
