Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter II: This part will help explain what we just talked about by showing how it applies in real situations.

The Antinomy of Pure Reason, Section Nine: About how we use the rule of reason when thinking about big ideas related to the universe.

We have shown again and again that pure ideas from our mind don’t directly explain things in the real world. This is because the idea that everything has a complete cause or explanation is based on a kind of reasoning that assumes things exist on their own, beyond what we experience. But since the world we experience never shows us this kind of complete explanation, we shouldn’t argue about whether the universe has an end or goes on forever. Instead, we should focus on how far back we can trace what we experience to its causes, and only accept answers that really fit what we observe.

So, what’s left is to accept that the rule of reason is useful as a guide for exploring possible experiences. But it’s not a rule that proves things are true by themselves. If we remember this clearly, the conflicts in reason will stop. The problems came from misunderstanding this idea. Once we see that, the rule of reason changes from something confusing into a helpful guide.

If we use this rule properly to get the most out of our understanding when exploring the world, it’s almost like having a rule that tells us about things themselves before we experience them. But even then, it won’t help us know more about the real world than by using our mind well when dealing with actual experiences.
