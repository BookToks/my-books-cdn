Here’s the proof: imagine that things made of parts don’t actually have simple parts. If you try to take away all the parts in your mind, there wouldn’t be any parts left at all—not even simple ones—so nothing would remain. That means there would be no substance at all.

So, either you can’t remove all the parts in your mind, or if you do, something must still be left that doesn’t have any parts—that is, something simple. 

If you can’t remove all the parts, then the thing made of parts wouldn’t really be made of substances, because substances are things that exist on their own, separate from how parts are put together. This idea goes against what we assumed at the start. 

That means only the other option is possible: things that are made up of parts actually have simple parts inside them.

From this, it follows that everything in the world is made of simple things. Being made of parts is just how these simple things appear on the outside. Even though we can’t actually separate these simple parts completely from their combinations, our minds have to think of them as the basic building blocks before they come together.
