Garve wrote an original and more understanding review that was published in its full form. He worried that Kant’s idea that practical reason alone has positive value would only be accepted by a few people (Morrison, p. 193).  

Karl Abraham Baron von Zedlitz (1731-1793) was an important figure who worked to improve education under Frederick the Great’s government. He joined the justice ministry in 1755. In 1770, the same year Kant got his university job, Zedlitz became Minister of Justice in charge of church and school matters. He stayed in this role until 1788, two years after Frederick died.

Zedlitz was known for being a religious free thinker. After Frederick William II came to power, he replaced Zedlitz with J.C. Wollner, who tried hard to enforce strict religious rules on teachers and clergy. Kant soon disagreed with Wollner. Zedlitz also helped set up new schools all over Prussia in the late 1700s. In 1778, he offered Kant a teaching job at the University of Halle, but Kant said no.

This preface was left out in the second edition of the book from 1787.

Christian Wolff (1679-1754) was a major thinker during the German Enlightenment. His most famous student, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714-1762), wrote a book called Metaphysica, which was the main text Kant used for his university lectures. Baumgarten’s book was published many times, with the seventh edition in 1779.

David Hume (1711-1776) was another important philosopher who was popular in Germany.

John Locke (1632-1704) aimed to find out the true, original limits of human knowledge by tracing all knowledge back to experience. His main book, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, was published in 1690. Locke is sometimes called the "physiologist of reason."

This refers to popular Enlightenment thinkers like Johann August Eberhard (1739-1809), J.G. Feder (1740-1821), Christian Garve (1742-1798), Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733-1811), and Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786).
