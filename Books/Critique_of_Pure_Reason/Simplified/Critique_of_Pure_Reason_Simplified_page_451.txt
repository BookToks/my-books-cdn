A thinking person is different from things that exist by themselves. People often get confused about how physical things affect our minds, but this confusion can be cleared up by showing that the idea isn’t really strong or clear.

If we ignore everything imaginary, the big question about how what thinks and what takes up space are connected would just be: How can we, as thinking beings, understand the world outside us—like space filled with shapes and movement?

But no one can really answer this question. No one will ever fully understand it. Instead, people say these outer appearances come from a “transcendental object” that causes us to see things, but we don’t actually know or understand this object at all. When we deal with what we experience, we treat these appearances as real things without worrying about why they are possible. But if we try to go deeper, we need the idea of this transcendental object.

Because of this, arguments about whether our mind existed before it connected with a body or could still think after the body dies don’t really work. Some say that before we sensed things in space, the same transcendental objects (which now appear as bodies) might have been understood in a totally different way. Others say that even if the way we sense the material world stops, the mind might still think and recognize those objects, just not as physical bodies.

No one can prove these ideas, and no one can say they’re definitely true or false. We just don’t know the real cause of what we see outside us. So no one can claim to truly understand what makes outer appearances real right now.
