Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III talks about how we understand causes, but not in a deep, theory-based way.

If you ignore everything we learn from experience and try to say that the idea of cause applies to everything random or uncertain, you have no good reason for thinking you can go from something that exists to something totally different called its cause. In this kind of thinking, the idea of cause, like the idea of something being random, loses all the meaning it has when we see it in real life.

When we try to figure out the cause of things in the world, this is not about natural science but about guessing or speculating. Natural science only looks at causes of events or changes, not the basic stuff things are made of. Saying that the stuff itself is random or caused by something else is just guessing. If you want to say the whole world has a cause outside of it, that’s also just speculation because it’s about something we can’t experience. The rule that every effect has a cause only works for things we can actually experience, and doesn’t make sense outside of that.

I say that trying to use reason just to prove things about God is useless and doesn’t work. The normal ways we use reason don’t lead to any real ideas about God. So if we don’t base theology on moral laws or use those laws to guide us, there’s no way to understand God by reason alone. All the rules we use to understand things work only inside what we can experience. But knowing about a highest being would need a way of understanding beyond experience, and we just don’t have that. If the rule about cause and effect is supposed to lead us to a first cause, that cause would have to be part of the chain of things we can experience, which means it would also have to be caused by something else. Even if we try to jump beyond experience by looking at causes and effects, what can we really understand? We never experience the biggest possible effect that would prove a highest cause. So, just to avoid having empty ideas in our minds, we...
