The study of the nature of thinking is called psychology, and here we only mean understanding it through reason.

Metaphysics has four main parts: 1. Ontology, 2. Rational Physiology, 3. Rational Cosmology, and 4. Rational Theology. The second part, which is about the nature of things based on pure reason, has two sections: rational physics and rational psychology. This split is not random but is based on the main goals of philosophy, so it’s fixed and important.

There might be some doubts about this system, especially about how we can know things about the world that we usually learn through our senses, which is experience. How can we understand the nature of things before we experience them and create a rational science of nature?

The answer is that we only use experience to get an object to think about, partly from the outside world and partly from inside our minds. For the outside, we think about matter as something solid and lifeless. For the inside, we think about ourselves as thinking beings. After that, metaphysics avoids using any other experience to make judgments about these things.

This kind of rational physics is not the same as what people usually call general physics, which is more about math than philosophy. Metaphysics ignores math and doesn’t give as many new insights as math does, but it’s still very important for understanding how we can use pure reason to study nature. Without it, even mathematicians might accidentally rely on ideas that don’t hold up under careful critique, although this doesn’t affect how useful math is in science.
