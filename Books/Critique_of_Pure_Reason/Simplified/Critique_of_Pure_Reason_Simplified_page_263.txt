They connect all the different things I think about to the same "I," so I can understand them together by saying "I think."

This rule doesn’t apply to every kind of understanding, only to one where I’m aware of all the different parts in my mind at once. An understanding that could see all the parts of what’s happening at the same time wouldn’t need a special step to put everything together like humans do. But humans have to do this because we only think, we don’t directly see everything happening.

Humans can’t even imagine another kind of understanding that would see things differently or in a way not based on space and time.

§ 18.

What it means to have a single, clear sense of self.

The "transcendental unity of apperception" is the way all the different parts we sense are joined together in our mind to form an idea of one object. It’s called "objective" because it relates to the object itself, and it’s different from the "subjective unity of consciousness," which is about how we personally experience things inside us.

Whether I notice many things happening at the same time or one after another depends on the situation and my experiences. So, the way my mind connects these experiences is based on appearances and can change.

But the pure way we sense time, just as time itself, holds all these parts together in our mind through a necessary connection to the "I think"—this is the basic way our understanding combines things before any experience.

Only this kind of unity is truly real and reliable. The way we connect experiences based on specific situations comes from this basic unity but is less certain and depends on the conditions around us.
