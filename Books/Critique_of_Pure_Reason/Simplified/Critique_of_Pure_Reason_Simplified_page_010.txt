Our goal is to create a complete collection of Kant's writings. This collection will show the high quality of Kant research done by English-speaking experts in the second half of the 1900s. It will also help and inspire more English-speaking readers to study Kant in the future.

We focus on translating Kantâ€™s work very literally and giving information instead of our own opinions. This way, our edition should still be useful even when ideas about Kant change or new discoveries are made.
