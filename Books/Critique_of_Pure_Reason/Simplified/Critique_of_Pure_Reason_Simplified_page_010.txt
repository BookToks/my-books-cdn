 Our aim is to produce a comprehensive edition of Kant's writings, embodying and displaying the high standards attained by Kant scholar­ ship in the English-speaking world during the second half of the twen­ tieth century, and serving as both an instrument and a stimulus for the further development of Kant studies by English-speaking readers in the century to come. Because of our emphasis on literalness of translation and on information rather than interpretation in editorial practices, we hope our edition will continue to be usable despite the inevitable evo­ lution and occasional revolutions in Kant scholarship.
