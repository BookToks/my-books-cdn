The reason why we can have experiences doesn’t come from the experiences themselves or the things we can experience. If it did, it wouldn’t have any real meaning because no actual pictures or feelings would match it. Our experiences come from these pictures or feelings, which give us the chance to know about things. 

If there are ideas that come before any experience, they can’t include anything from real life. But they still have to be the basic rules that make experience possible, because without them, experience wouldn’t have any real meaning.

So, if you want to understand how these basic ideas work, you need to figure out the rules that make experience possible, even if you ignore everything that comes from real life. A perfect idea that explains these rules clearly and in all cases is called a pure concept of understanding.

Once I have these pure ideas, I can think about things that might be impossible or things that might be possible but we can’t experience, like the idea of a spirit or even God. But these ideas don’t come from experience because then they wouldn’t be “pure.” They must always include the basic rules needed for any experience or object, or else they wouldn’t make sense or even be possible to think about.

These ideas, which hold the basic thinking for every experience, are found in what we call categories. We already know these categories are real because we can think about objects using them. But thinking involves more than just the ability to think; it involves understanding too. Since understanding is about knowing objects, we first need to look at how our mind works before experience, to understand the basic rules that make experience possible.

If every idea we had was completely separate from the others, like unrelated pictures, then we couldn’t understand anything.
