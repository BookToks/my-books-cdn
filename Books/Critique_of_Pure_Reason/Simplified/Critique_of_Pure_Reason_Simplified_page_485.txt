If we think about the whole world filling all space, then putting together all the parts of an infinite world would mean that an infinite amount of time has passed, which is impossible. So, an infinite number of actual things can’t be seen as one complete whole at the same time. Because of this, the world can’t be infinite in size; instead, it has limits, which was the second point.

Now, about the first argument, I didn’t try to trick anyone or use clever tricks like a lawyer might do to win a case unfairly. Each argument comes from the real nature of the problem, and I don’t want to take advantage of anyone’s mistakes or misunderstandings.

I could have also used a different proof by assuming a wrong idea of what infinity means. People say something is infinite if there’s nothing bigger than it. But you can always add one more unit to any number, so there is no biggest number. That means an infinite size or an infinite world, whether in time or space, is impossible. So, the world must have limits in both time and space.

I could explain it this way, but this idea of infinity isn’t what people usually mean by an infinite whole. It doesn’t show how big it really is. Instead, it only compares to a certain unit you choose. Depending on how big or small that unit is, the idea of infinity changes too, but infinity would stay the same because it’s just a relation to that unit. This way, you don’t really understand the full size of the whole thing, which isn’t the point here.

The real idea of infinity is that you can never finish adding one thing after another when counting through something.
