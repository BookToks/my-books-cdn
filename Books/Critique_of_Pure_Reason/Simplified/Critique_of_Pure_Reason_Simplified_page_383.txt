There are two important ideas that always come up when we try to understand things. One is the general idea of something, and the other is the specific way we understand it. Think of the first as the basic stuff, and the second as the shape or form it takes.

Long ago, people who studied logic called the general idea the "matter" and the specific difference the "form." When we make a statement, the ideas we use are like the matter, and the way we connect them is the form. In every object, its parts are the matter, and the way these parts fit together is the form.

When we think about everything that could exist, the unlimited reality is the matter, and the limits or differences that separate things are the form. Our mind needs something to start with (at least an idea) before it can understand it in a certain way. So, the matter comes before the form in pure understanding.

Because of this, the philosopher Leibniz thought that things (which he called monads) have an inner way of representing themselves first, and then their relationships with each other come after.

That’s why space and time can exist: space happens because of how things relate to each other, and time happens because of how their changes connect like cause and effect. This would only be true if our mind could know things directly and if space and time were real parts of the things themselves.

But if we only know things through our senses, which only show us appearances, then the way we sense things (the form of intuition) comes before what we actually sense (the matter). So space and time come first and allow us to have any sensory experience at all.

Some philosophers didn’t like the idea that form comes before things and controls what’s possible. They thought we should know things as they really are, even if not perfectly. But since sensing is a special way our mind works that shapes all perception before we even experience anything, the form is original and comes first.

So, it’s not that the things themselves (the matter) create the form, but the possibility of things depends on the form of space and time being there first.
