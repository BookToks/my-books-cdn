People have ideas about the universe that try to go beyond what we can actually experience, but still stay connected to what we can see and test.

This happens because sometimes we want to understand everything that causes something to happen, not just part of it. So, we use big ideas that go beyond what we can actually find in real life, to feel like we have a complete picture. Reason tells us that if something depends on other things, then all those things together must be real, even if we can’t see them. These big ideas are really just regular ideas taken to their limits.

But not all ideas work this way. Only the ones that involve a chain of causes, one leading to another, make sense here. Reason cares about these chains that go up from one cause to the next, not about causes that happen at the same time or effects that come after. When we think about causes, they are already assumed to be there with what they cause. But since effects don’t make causes happen, we don’t worry if the chain of effects ever ends.

For example, we naturally think that all the time from the past up to now has happened, even if we can’t know exactly how. But the future doesn’t affect the present, so it doesn’t matter if the future goes on forever or stops at some point. If we have a chain where one thing depends on another, we have to believe the whole chain up to that point is real. But what comes after doesn’t have to be assumed real, only possible.
