This principle is closely related to the formula saying that God always does things in the most perfect way, involving the greatest variety combined with the great­ est order. See Discourse on Metaphysics §§ 5-6,4:43°-2; Principles of Nature and Grace §§ 3, 10; Monadology § 58.
 
 120 Charles Bonnet (1726-1793) was a Swiss naturalist. The work referred to is Contemplation de la nature (Amsterdam: Chez Marc-Michel Ray, 1764), which Kant probably knew in its German version: Betrachtungen iiber die Natur, tr. Johann Daniel Titus (Leipzig: Junius, 1766), pp. 29-85.
 
 121 In biology, "palingenesis" was used to refer to the process by which an or­ ganism metamorphoses from one stage to another in the course of its life cycle. (The term was used in this sense, for example, by Bonnet, see pre­ vious note.) But it also meant "metempsychosis," or the transmigration of a soul from one life to another, and it appears to be in this sense that Kant uses the term here. The relation between the two senses was discussed by Leibniz, New System of Nature, 4:479-80, Monadology §§ 72-74. See also Baumgarten, Metaphysica § 704.

 124 Compare: "As for the future, we must not, with the quietists, stand ridicu­ lously with arms folded, awaiting that which God will do, according to the sophism which the ancients called AOYOV a£QYov, the lazy reason" (Leib­ niz, Discourse on Metaphysics § 4, G 4:430). "Quietism" is a form of Chris­ tian spirituality, influential in the seventeenth century, which urges the wickedness and futility of all human effort and advocates complete resig­ nation to the will of God. Its best-known advocates were Miguel de Molinos (164°-1697), Jeanne Marie Guyon (1648-1717), and Franc;ois de Salignac de la Mothe Fenelon (1650-1715), Archbishop of Cambrai.
 
 Quietism was a consistent target of Leibniz's criticism. For the source of the term ignava ratio and its condemnation by "the ancients," see the fol­ lowing note.
 
 125 "This kind of reasoning is justly called lazy or inert, because with the same reasoning one would suppress every activity in life" (De fato 12-13 [28-30]). Cicero is objecting to Chrysippus's Stoic doctrine of fate. This allusion is employed in Leibniz, Theodjcy § 55. Leibniz's use of the Greek AOYOV a£QYov, suggests an earlier (Greek) source, but apparently only the target (Stoicism), and not the epithet itself, was Greek.
 
 126 V(J1;T]Qov JtQOT£QOV refers broadly to the error of putting first that which should come later ("putting the cart before the horse"), or more narrowly, in logic, to the methodological error of proving first what should have been proved later.

 Doctrine of method Kant alludes, of course, to the biblical story of Babel (Genesis 11.1-9).
