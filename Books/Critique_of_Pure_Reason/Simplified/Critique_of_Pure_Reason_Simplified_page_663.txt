In a situation without laws, fights only stop when one side wins, and both sides brag about it. But usually, this leads to a shaky peace made by someone in charge. In a society with laws, though, the fight ends with a decision from a court. This decision solves the problem for good and keeps peace forever. When people argue just based on opinions, it can go on forever. That’s why we need to check those opinions carefully and make laws based on them. Like Hobbes said, without laws, life is unfair and violent. So, we must accept rules that limit our freedom just enough to keep everyone’s freedom safe and help everyone live well together.

Freedom also means being able to share your thoughts and questions, even if you can’t solve them yourself, without being called troublemakers. This right comes from human reason, which listens to everyone’s ideas. Since progress depends on this, this freedom is very important and shouldn’t be taken away. It’s also smart not to call bold ideas dangerous, especially if many people already agree with them, because that would give those ideas too much power.

When I hear someone says they have proven that humans don’t have free will, there’s no afterlife, or God doesn’t exist, I want to read what they wrote. I’m curious because I want to learn new things. But I’m sure they won’t prove those things, not because I already know the truth, but because reason alone can’t prove or disprove these ideas. For example, how could someone know for sure that there is no highest being? These questions are beyond what we can experience and understand. I don’t bother reading people who only defend religion by attacking others’ ideas, because they just try to replace one illusion with another, which doesn’t help us learn. But someone who argues against religion with strong ideas can actually help us think better and improve our understanding, and I’m not afraid of their challenges.
