Gram talked about Kant’s ideas in his book called *Kant: Disputed Questions* (1967), pages 23-61. Norman Kemp Smith later shared these ideas in English in his book *A Commentary to Kant’s ‘Critique of Pure Reason’* (1923). But H. J. Paton didn’t agree with them. He wrote articles like “Is the Transcendental Deduction a Patchwork?” (1929) and “The Key to Kant’s Deduction of the Categories” (1931), which you can find in Gram’s book on pages 62-91 and 247-68. Paton also explained his views in *Kant’s Metaphysic of Experience* (1936).

Later, some ideas like these came back in books by Robert Paul Wolff (*Kant’s Theory of Mental Activity*, 1963) and Paul Guyer (*Kant and the Claims of Knowledge*, 1987).

People still aren’t sure if Kant had one clear plan for his deduction or not.

There are many references to Kant’s work and letters, showing where you can find his ideas in detail. Some of these include letters and notes from different pages and volumes, pointing to specific parts of his writings.

Frederick C. Beiser explains how Feder changed Garve’s draft in *The Fate of Reason* (1987), pages 172-7. There’s also a translation of a review in Johann Schultz’s *Exposition of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason* (1995), pages 171-7. Garve tried to calm Kant down but later published his original review in a friendlier journal in 1783; you can find this translation in Morrison’s book, pages 179-99.

Other important parts of Kant’s work are found in the *Prolegomena* and *Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science*, with many notes and sections listed for those who want to read more closely.

For a timeline of these events, see Benno Erdmann’s notes in volume 3, pages 555-8.
