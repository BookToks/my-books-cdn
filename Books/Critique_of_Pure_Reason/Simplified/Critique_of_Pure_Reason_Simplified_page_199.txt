Part I. The Transcendental Aesthetic

The difference between unclear and clear ideas is just about how we think, and it doesn’t change what the idea is about. The idea of what is right, used by normal people, has the same meaning as the deep ideas philosophers come up with. The difference is that regular people don’t think about all the details. So, you can’t say that the common idea is just based on what we see or feel, because what is right isn’t something you can just see. It’s a concept in our minds that guides how we act morally.

When we picture a body in our mind, it doesn’t show the real thing itself. It only shows how it looks to us and how it affects us. Our ability to feel or sense things is called sensibility. This is very different from truly knowing the object itself, even if we study the appearance really closely.

The old philosophy from Leibniz and Wolff was wrong because it looked at the difference between feeling and thinking as just a matter of logic. But it’s more than that—it’s about where our knowledge comes from and what it contains. Through our senses, we don’t know the real nature of things at all. If we take away our personal way of sensing, the object we thought we saw disappears because it only exists as an appearance shaped by us.

Usually, we know the difference between what always comes with how we sense things and what only happens sometimes depending on the situation or our body. We often say the first kind of knowledge shows the real object itself, and the second kind just shows its appearance. But this difference is only based on experience. If we think this experience is the real thing, we lose the deeper understanding that what we see is just an appearance, and nothing about the real object itself.
