When I see a ship moving down a river, I first notice it upstream before seeing it downstream. It’s impossible to see it downstream first and then upstream. So, the order I see these things in is fixed and can’t be changed.

But if I look at a house, I might start looking from the roof and end at the ground, or I could start at the ground and go up. I could also look at the house from the left or the right. In these cases, the order I see things isn’t fixed or necessary.

When something happens, like the ship moving, the order I see it in is always important and has to follow a certain rule.

So, I have to figure out the order I see things based on the real order they happen in. If I didn’t, the order would be random and I wouldn’t be able to tell one event from another. The real order of events shows me how things connect, not just the order I notice them.

This means that what happens first creates a rule that makes the next thing happen after it. But I can’t look backward from an event to decide what came before it. Events don’t go backward in time; they only follow something that happened earlier.

Because something always comes after something else, I have to connect later events to earlier ones based on a rule. The earlier thing causes the later thing to happen, so the later event depends on the earlier one.

If nothing came before an event, then there would be no way to know the order of what I see or experience.
