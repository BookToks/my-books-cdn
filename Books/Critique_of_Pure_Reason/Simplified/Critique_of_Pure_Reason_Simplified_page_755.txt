 44 As mentioned in note I above, there are a number ofK ant's reflections giv­ ing evidence of his discovery of the antinomies in 1769 (e.g. R 3936-37, 17=355) and the antinomies predominate in Kant's first outlines of the "Dialectic" in R 4756-60 (1775-77, 17=699-713)' Other important notes from this period are R 4742 (17:694) and R 4780 (17:725)' From the 1780s, important reflections on the antinomies include R 5959-61 (18:399-401), R 5962 (1785-89, 18:401-5), R 5970 (1783-84, 18:408-9), R 5973 (1783-84, 18:411-12) and R 5979 (1785-88, 18:413-14), 45 With these two paragraphs, compare R 4454 (1772? 1773-75? 17=557)· 46 "A WORLD is a series (multitude, whole) of actual finite things which are not parts of one another" (Baumgarten, Metaphysica § 354); "In every world there are actual parts, which are singulars connected into a whole" (Meta­ physica § 357).
 
 47 For the source of this principle in Wolffian cosmology, see following note.
 
 48 "Because the parts of the world are either simultaneous or successive, if they are posited outside one another, they are connected in the world either by time or by space or by both" (Baumgarten, Metaphysica § 374; cf. § 238). In four successive paragraphs, Baumgarten considers the parts of the world connected in space and time (first antinomy) (Metaphysica § 374), connected causally (third antinomy) (Metaphysica § 375), connected as actual parts (sec­ ond antinomy) (Metaphysica § 376), and as possibles forming a contingent whole (fourth antinomy) (Metaphysica § 377). He concludes that either there is no world, or that it must consist in a multitude or series forming a unity (Metaphysica § 379). This says, in effect, that if the (conditioned) members of each of the identified series are given, then the whole (the un­ conditioned) must also be given. At the same time, Baumgarten notes that because it is so constituted, the unity of the world is a "hypothetical unity" (Metaphysica § 362) as distinct from an "absolute" unity (Metaphysica § 76).
 
 49 "A PROGRESS (regress) TO INFINITY is a series of contingent entities posited outside one another, of which one is the cause of the other" (Baum­ garten, Metaphysica § 380).
 
 50 Baumgarten argues that the world must consist of simple parts or monads (Baumgarten, Metaphysica §§ 392-4°5). Compare Leibniz, Monadology § 1.
 
 51 Compare Baumgarten, Metaphysica §§ 388-90, which argues (no doubt with Spinoza in mind) that the world is not a substance, its parts are not accidents, and an infinite substance is not a unique substance.
 
 52 Compare Baumgarten, Metaphysica §§ 358, 380-1.
 
 53 Baumgarten emphasizes the contingency both oft he parts oft he world and of the world as a whole (Metaphysica §§ 361-64). He argues that if we sup­ pose the world to be necessary, then we must suppose that the determina­ tion of its parts is also necessary, hence that the parts themselves must be necessary and therefore infinite (which contradicts the nature of parts) (Metaphysica § 361).
