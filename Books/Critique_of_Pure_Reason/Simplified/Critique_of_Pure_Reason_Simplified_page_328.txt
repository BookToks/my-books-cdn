How does something change from one state, called a, to another state, called b? Between these two moments, there is always some time passing. Between the two states at these moments, there is always a difference that has size because everything we see or experience has size.

So, every change happens during the time between two moments. The first moment shows the starting state, and the second moment shows the ending state. These two moments mark the beginning and end of the change, including everything that happens in between.

Every change has a cause, which works during the entire time the change happens. This cause doesn't make the change all at once but works gradually. As time moves from the first moment a to the last moment b, the size of the change (b minus a) grows through all the smaller steps between the start and end.

All changes happen because of a cause working continuously. If this cause works steadily, we call it a "moment." The change itself isn’t made up of these moments, but it happens because of them.

This idea explains that change is continuous. Time and what we see in time don’t have smallest parts, but changes still go through all these parts as steps from the first state to the second. No difference, either in reality or time, is the smallest possible. The new state grows out of the first by going through infinitely many tiny steps, each smaller than the difference between a and a.

We won’t talk about how useful this idea is for studying nature right now. But it’s important to understand how such a big idea can be known without experience, just by thinking. Even though it seems obvious and correct, we shouldn’t just believe it without proof, because many ideas that seem to come from pure thinking aren’t always reliable.

All new knowledge and better understanding come from getting better at sensing time, no matter what we look at. This progress happens in time and can’t be explained by anything else. The parts of time only exist because of time itself; they don’t exist before time.
