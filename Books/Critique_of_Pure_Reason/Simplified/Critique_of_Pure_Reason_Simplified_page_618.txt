So, they probably have a good and clear purpose based on how our reason naturally works. But, as usual, a bunch of tricky people make a big fuss about nonsense and contradictions. They criticize the system without really understanding its true plans, even though they benefit from it and the education that lets them complain in the first place.

You can’t really use an idea safely without proving it first. The big ideas of reason aren’t like the simple categories we can prove easily. But if these big ideas are going to mean anything, even just a little, and not be empty thoughts, then we have to find a way to prove them—even if it’s very different from how we prove categories. This proof is the final step in understanding pure reason, and that’s what we’re going to do now.

It matters a lot whether something is given to my reason as a real object or just as an idea. If it’s real, my thoughts can fully understand the object. But if it’s only an idea, then there’s no actual object, not even a possible one. Instead, it’s just a way to organize other objects in my mind, based on how they fit together. For example, the idea of a highest intelligence is just an idea. It doesn’t directly relate to a real object, so we can’t prove it exists. Instead, it’s a way to think about things in general, organized by the idea of the greatest unity in reason.
