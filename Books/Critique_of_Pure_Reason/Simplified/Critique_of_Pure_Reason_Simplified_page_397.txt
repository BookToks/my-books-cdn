Earlier, we said that dialectic is a kind of logic that deals with illusions. This doesn’t mean it’s about guessing or probability. Probability is about truth, but based on not enough information, so the understanding is incomplete but not wrong. That’s why it still fits with regular logic.

Also, we shouldn’t mix up appearance and illusion. Truth and illusion aren’t in the object itself when we see it, but in how we think about it. People say our senses don’t make mistakes, not because they always judge right, but because senses don’t actually make judgments at all.

So, truth and error, and even illusions that cause errors, are only in judgments. Judgments happen when our mind connects what we sense with how we understand it. When our knowledge follows the mind’s rules perfectly, there’s no error. But just seeing something with our senses doesn’t involve judgment, so it can’t be wrong.

Nature always follows its own laws, so neither the mind alone nor the senses alone can be wrong. The mind can’t be wrong because its judgments follow its own rules. Truth means agreeing with these rules. The senses don’t judge, so they can’t be true or false.

Since we only get knowledge from the mind and the senses, errors happen when feelings or senses secretly affect the mind’s understanding. This mix-up causes our judgment to drift away from the truth, like a ball rolling straight but curving when pushed by another force at the same time.
