This smart thinker soon realized that the usual way people try to prove that the soul can’t stop existing by breaking apart doesn’t actually prove the soul has to last forever. Someone could still say the soul just disappears completely.

In his book Phaedo, he tried to show that a simple being like the soul can’t stop existing because it can’t lose parts little by little and turn into nothing. Since the soul doesn’t have parts inside it, there’s no time when it exists and then doesn’t exist, which he thought was impossible.

But he didn’t think about the fact that even if the soul is simple and has no parts, it can still lose some of its power or reality bit by bit. This means it could slowly fade away, not by breaking apart, but by losing all its abilities over time.

Even being aware has levels, and these levels can go down. So the soul’s ability to be aware of itself and everything else could also weaken and disappear. Because of this, the idea that the soul always stays the same inside us can’t really be proven.

Also, being aware doesn’t just mean knowing something clearly. There are many levels of awareness, from very clear to very faint, and these levels can change all the time until they vanish completely.
