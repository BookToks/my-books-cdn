If we think about things that we can’t sense with our eyes, ears, or other senses, our usual ways of thinking don’t really apply. Even if we imagine some other kind of way to understand things besides our senses, we wouldn’t be able to use our normal thinking tools to make sense of them.

When we talk about “noumena,” it means things that exist beyond what we can sense. We don’t have any way to know or understand these things because our brains use categories that only work with what we can sense. So, while it’s possible that there are things we can’t sense, we can’t really say much about them or be sure they exist.

Thinking itself isn’t made by our senses and isn’t limited by them, but thinking alone doesn’t help much because it needs something to think about. We can’t call noumena real objects because they require a different kind of understanding than what we have, which makes them a confusing idea.

So, the idea of noumena isn’t really about knowing real objects. Instead, it’s about the question of whether there could be things completely outside what we can sense. We can’t say for sure if they exist, but we also can’t completely rule them out, since our way of understanding is limited to what we can sense.
