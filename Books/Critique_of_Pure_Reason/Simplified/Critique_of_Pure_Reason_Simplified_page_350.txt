We have carefully looked at all the basic ideas that help us understand things, which already proves that idealism (the idea that only our mind is real) is wrong. But it gets even clearer when we think about how we know ourselves just by looking inside our own minds, without using any outside experiences. This shows us the limits of what we can really know this way.

The main point is: all the basic rules of pure understanding are just about what makes experience possible. Every important idea that we can know before experience depends completely on this connection to experience.

Now, we have not only studied pure understanding in detail, but we have also looked at it as a whole. We have divided everything we can know into two types: things we can experience (phenomena) and things we canâ€™t experience but can think about (noumena).
