Pt. II. Div. I. Bk. II. Ch. III <B> tal use, is a proposition that, if it � n be recognizeda with conviction, points to important consequences.p 'he transcendental use of a concept in any sort of principle consists in its being related to things in general and in themselves; its empirical use, however, in its being related A239 merely to appearances, i.e., objects of a possible experienc�But that it is only the latter that can ever take place is evident from the follow­ ing. For every concept there is requisite, first, the logical form of a con­ cept (of thinking) in general, and then, second, the possibility of giving it an object to which it is to be related. Without this latter it has no sense, and is entirely empty of content, even though it may still contain the logical function for making a concept out of whatever sort of data there are. Now the object cannot be given to a concept othenvise than in intuition, and, even if a pure intuition is possible a priori prior to the object, then even this can acquire its object, thus its objective validity, only through empirical intuition, of which it is the mere form. Thus all concepts and with them all principles, however a priori they may be, are nevertheless related to empirical intuitions, i.e., to data for possible ex­ perience. Without this they have no objective validity at all, but are rather a mere play, whether it be with representations of the imagina­ tion or of the understanding. One need only take as an example the B299 concepts of mathematics, and first, indeed, in their pure intuitions.
 
 Space has three dimensions, between two points there can be only one straight line, etc. Although all these principles, and the representation of the object with which this science occupies itself, are generated in the mind completely a priori, they would still not signify anything at all if we could not always exhibit their significance in appearances (empirical objects). Hence it is also requisite for one to make an abstract concept sensible, i.e., to display the objectb that corresponds to it in intuition, since without this the concept would remain (as one says) without sense, i.e., without significance. Mathematics fulfills this requirement by means of the construction of the figure,' which is an appearance present to the senses (even though brought about a priori). In the same science the concept of magnitude seeks its standing and sense in number, but seeks this in turn in the fingers, in the beads of an abacus, or in strokes and points that are placed before the eyes. The concept is always generated a priori, together with the synthetic principles or formulas from such concepts; but their use and relation to supposed objects can in the end be sought nowhere but in experience, the possibility of which (as far as its form is concerned) is contained in them a priori.
