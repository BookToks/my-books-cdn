The important idea here is that when we use a concept in a special way, it relates to things in general and by themselves. But when we use it in a regular way, it only relates to how things appear to us, like in our experiences.

Every concept needs two things: first, the basic way we think about it, and second, something it actually connects to in the real world. Without the second part, the concept doesn’t really mean anything. We can only connect a concept to something through what we can sense or imagine. Even if we have a pure idea before seeing anything, it only becomes real when we connect it to something we can experience.

So, all concepts and rules, even those we think up without any experience, still depend on things we can experience. Without this, they are just empty ideas or mental games.

For example, in math, we know space has three dimensions and that there’s only one straight line between two points. We come up with these ideas in our minds without seeing anything first, but they only matter because we can show them through things we see or touch.

To understand an abstract idea, we need to connect it to something we can sense. Math does this by creating shapes we can imagine or draw. The idea of size or amount is connected to numbers, which we count on fingers or with beads or marks we see.

We come up with these ideas first in our heads, but they only really work when we relate them to things we experience. This is true for all basic categories and principles too.
