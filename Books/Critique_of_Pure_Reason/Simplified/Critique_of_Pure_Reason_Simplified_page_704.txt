When we organize knowledge in a clear and connected way, it changes from just random facts into real science. Architectonic is the study of how our knowledge becomes scientific, so it’s a key part of learning how to think properly.

When we use reason, our knowledge can’t just be a jumble of ideas. It has to form a system, which helps us reach important goals. A system means all the different pieces of knowledge fit together under one main idea. This idea shows how the whole thing is put together and how the parts relate to each other before we even look at the details.

Because all parts connect to one goal, if something is missing, we can tell right away. Nothing is added randomly or without limits. The whole system is arranged carefully, not just thrown together. It can grow from the inside, like a body getting stronger, but it doesn’t grow by adding random new parts.

To make this system work, we need a plan, called a schema. This plan organizes the parts based on the main goal and sets the order before we start building the system.
