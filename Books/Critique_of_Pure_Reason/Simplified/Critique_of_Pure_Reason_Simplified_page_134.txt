My changes to how I present things only go up to the end of the first chapter of the Transcendental Dialectic and not beyond, because I didn’t have enough time.

The only real addition I’ve made is a new argument against psychological idealism, which I think is the only solid proof that things outside of us really exist.

Even though some people think idealism is harmless for philosophy, it’s actually a big problem. It’s strange that we have to just believe that things outside of us exist, since all our knowledge comes from them. If someone doubts this, we usually can’t give a good answer.

There are some unclear parts in my proof, so I want to change one part to say: “But this constant part can’t be just something I imagine. Everything inside me is just an idea, and ideas need something real and separate from them to explain how they change and how I exist over time.”

Someone might say: I only know what’s inside me, like my ideas of things outside. So, it’s still unclear if something outside actually exists.

But I’m aware of myself existing over time, and that’s more than just knowing my ideas. This awareness depends on something outside me. So, my sense of existing in time is connected to being related to something outside me. This is real experience, not just imagination.

Outer sense is about relating to something real outside me. Its reality depends on it being connected with inner experience, which makes it possible.

If I could know myself through pure thinking alone, without senses, then I wouldn’t have to be connected to anything outside me.

But since inner experience comes first, and that needs outer experience too, my awareness of myself depends on being related to something outside me.

I didn’t have time to revise the rest of the book, but experts who reviewed it didn’t misunderstand it, and I’m thankful to them. I hope they see that I paid attention to their advice in the right places.
