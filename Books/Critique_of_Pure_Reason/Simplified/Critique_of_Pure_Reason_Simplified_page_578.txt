Even though it seems like something has to be true by logic, this idea is actually kind of tricky. When you make a concept based on something’s meaning, you might think that because existence is part of that idea, the thing must exist for sure. You believe that if you imagine the thing as real, it has to exist because that’s part of what you’re thinking.

If you take away the property (predicate) in a statement but keep the thing (subject), you get a contradiction. So, you say the property has to belong to the thing. But if you take away both the thing and its property, no contradiction happens because there’s nothing left to argue about. For example, if you say a triangle doesn’t have three angles, that’s a contradiction. But if you say there’s no triangle at all, then there’s no problem because the whole thing is gone. It’s the same with an absolutely necessary being. If you say it doesn’t exist, you’re also canceling everything about it, so no contradiction appears.

For example, saying “God is all-powerful” is a necessary statement if you assume God exists as an infinite being. You can’t take away God’s power without also taking away God. But if you say “God doesn’t exist,” then you also remove all of God’s qualities. There’s no contradiction there because you canceled the whole idea.

So, if you remove both the thing and its property, you won’t find a contradiction no matter what. The only way to avoid this is to say some things can’t be canceled at all—they have to exist. But that means you’re saying some things are absolutely necessary, which is exactly what I questioned. I don’t see how you can think of something that would be a contradiction if all its properties were removed. Without contradiction, there’s no reason to say it’s impossible.

You argue back that there is one special concept where thinking it doesn’t exist is a contradiction, and you use that as proof.
