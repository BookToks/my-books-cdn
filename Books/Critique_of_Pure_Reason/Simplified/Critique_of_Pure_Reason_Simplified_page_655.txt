In Chapter 1, Section 1, it says that reason often doesn’t need to keep checking if its ideas might have mistakes or if it needs to change them.

I split all sure statements (whether they can be proven or are obviously true) into two groups: dogmata and mathemata. A dogma is a statement made by directly connecting ideas. A mathema is a statement made by building ideas step by step. Analytic judgments don’t really teach us anything new about something because they just explain what we already know about it. So, they aren’t called dogmas (which you can think of as theorems). Usually, only the statements found in philosophy are called dogmata. For example, math statements like those in arithmetic or geometry aren’t usually called dogmata. This shows that only statements made directly from ideas are dogmatic, not those built by constructing ideas.

Pure reason, when used just for thinking, doesn’t have any direct statements made from ideas alone. This is because it can’t make any new true statements about the world without relying on experience. When it uses ideas, it only builds safe principles by connecting these ideas to something uncertain—possible experience. If you assume experience is possible, then these principles are definitely true. But by themselves, these ideas can’t be known for sure without experience. For example, no one can understand the statement “Everything that happens has a cause” just from ideas alone. So, it’s not a dogma. But from the perspective of experience, it can be proven for sure. It’s called a principle, not a theorem, because it makes experience itself possible and must be assumed first.

If pure reason doesn’t have dogmata in its speculative use, then using any dogmatic method—whether borrowed from math or something special—is not right in this case.
