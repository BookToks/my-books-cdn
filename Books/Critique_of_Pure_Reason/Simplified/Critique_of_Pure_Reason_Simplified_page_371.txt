Part II, Division I, Book II, Chapter III

Things appear one after another, and this order shows that something exists after it didn’t exist before, or the other way around. This means change happens. Saying that “not-being” or non-existence doesn’t contradict itself is just a weak argument based on logic. While I can imagine something stopping to exist without breaking any rules in my mind, I can’t jump from that idea to saying it’s actually possible for that thing to stop existing in real life.

When we think about how things interact with each other, it’s clear that basic ideas like “substance” and “cause” don’t have clear definitions that tell us exactly what these things are. So, the idea that things cause each other in a back-and-forth way is just as hard to define.

No one has ever been able to clearly explain what possibility, existence, or necessity really mean, except by repeating obvious statements. This happens when people try to define these ideas using only pure logic. Mistaking the logical possibility of an idea (just because it doesn’t contradict itself) for the real possibility that something exists in the world can trick and fool people who don’t have much experience.

Because of this, it’s clear that pure ideas from our understanding don’t tell us anything about things themselves, but only about what we might experience. The rules of understanding only apply to things we can sense, and not to things in general without considering how we might actually perceive them.

So, the big lesson from this is that our understanding can only guess the shape of possible experiences before we have them. Since anything that isn’t something we can experience can’t be an object for us, our understanding can’t go beyond what we can sense. The rules we have are only about organizing appearances — what we see or sense — and not about knowing things as they really are. Any claim to know things beyond that, just by thinking alone, is too proud and not justified.
