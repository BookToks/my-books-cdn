On the paralogisms of pure reason, it’s not true that there is a fixed and lasting feeling or intuition where thoughts would change.

Because of this, the first argument in transcendental psychology gives us what seems like a new idea, but it’s not really new. It treats the constant logical “I” of thinking as if it were the knowledge of a real, existing subject. But we don’t and can’t know this subject, because consciousness is the one thing that turns all our experiences into thoughts. So, in this “transcendental subject,” our perceptions happen. Besides this logical meaning of the “I,” we don’t know the subject itself that supports this “I” and all our thoughts.

Still, you can accept the idea that “The soul is a substance,” as long as you admit that this idea doesn’t lead anywhere else. It can’t teach us things like the soul lasting forever, even after a person dies. So, it only means “substance” as an idea, not as something real.

Second paralogism of simplicity.

Something whose actions can never be seen as the work of many things acting together is simple.

Now, the soul, or the thinking “I,” is that kind of thing.

So on and so forth.

This is the weak point in all the tricky arguments about the soul in pure reason. It’s not just a silly trick a thinker made up to make their ideas seem true, but an argument that seems strong and hard to challenge. Here it is.

Every combined substance is made up of many parts, and the actions of a combined thing are made up of many smaller actions. These actions come from many parts working together. Of course, an effect caused by many things working together is possible if this effect is only external, like the movement of a body coming from all its parts moving together.
