We will focus on finishing our main goal here, which is to briefly explain how all knowledge comes from pure reason. We start where the basic source of our thinking splits into two parts, one of which is reason. By "reason," I mean the whole higher ability to understand things, and I compare this to knowledge that comes from experience.

If we ignore the actual content of knowledge, then all knowledge, based on the person who knows it, is either from history or from reason. Historical knowledge comes from things that are given to us, while rational knowledge comes from principles. No matter how someone first got their knowledge, it is historical if they only understand it because it was given to them by someone else, like through experience, being told, or learning from books.

For example, someone who has learned a system of philosophy, like the Wolffian system, knows all the ideas, explanations, and proofs but only because they were taught. They don't come up with new ideas on their own and only understand as much as they were given. If you challenge one of their definitions, they won't know how to find a new one. They have copied someone elseâ€™s thinking, but copying is not the same as creating. So, even though this knowledge is really based on reason, for the person it is just historical because they did not discover it themselves. They have learned and remembered it well, but they are like a plaster statue of a real person.

True rational knowledge, which originally comes from human reason itself, is only really called rational if it is taken from the universal sources of reason. This means it comes from thinking carefully and even questioning what has been learned. All rational knowledge comes either from ideas or from building ideas. The first is called philosophical, and the second is called mathematical. I already explained the difference between the two earlier. So, knowledge can be philosophical in its content but still be historical for the person who only learned it from others.
