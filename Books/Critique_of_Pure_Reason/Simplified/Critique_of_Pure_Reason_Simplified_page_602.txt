Critique of all speculative theology Thus the highest being remains for the merely speculative use of rea足 son a mere but nevertheless faultless ideal, a concept which concludes and crowns the whole of human cognition, whose objective reality can足 not of course be proved on this path, but also cannot be refuted; and if there should be a moral theology that can make good this lack, then transcendental theology, up to now only problematic, will prove to be indispensable through determining its concept and by ceaselessly cen足 soring a reason that is deceived often enough by sensibility and does not always agree with its own ideas. Necessity, infinity, unity, existence out足 side the world (not as soul of the world), eternity without all conditions of time, omnipresence without all conditions of space, omnipotence, etc.: these are purely transcendental predicates, and hence a purified A642/B670 concept of them, which every theology needs so very badly, can be drawn only from transcendental theology.a a In his copy of the first edition, Kant adds: "Whether, if there is no demonstration of the existence of God, there is not at least a great probability. This is not at all worthy of the object [Objects] also not possible on this path. Probability in the absolutely necessary is contradictory.
