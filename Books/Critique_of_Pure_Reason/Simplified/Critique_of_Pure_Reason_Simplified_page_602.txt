When we use reason just to think about things, the idea of the highest being (like God) stays as a perfect but only imagined concept. It finishes and completes all human knowledge, but we can’t prove it’s real just by thinking like this. At the same time, we can’t say it’s false either.

If there is a moral theology that can fix this problem, then transcendental theology—which has only been a question until now—will become very important. It will help us understand the idea better and keep checking reason when it gets tricked by feelings or doesn’t match its own ideas.

Words like necessity, infinity, unity, existing outside the world (not as the world’s soul), timelessness, being everywhere without space limits, all-powerfulness, and so on are pure ideas that go beyond what we can experience. Only transcendental theology can give us a clear, cleaned-up idea of these things, which every theology really needs.

Kant also says that if we can’t prove God’s existence, maybe there’s at least a high chance it’s true. But even that idea doesn’t work well here because something absolutely necessary can’t just be probably true.

Any idea that something is necessary just because we think so is a personal need of our reasoning, not an objective fact.
