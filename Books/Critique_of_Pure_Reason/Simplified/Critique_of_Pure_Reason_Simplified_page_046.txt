. . Philoso­ phers can acquire their concepts only by means of analysis -and that completely changes the method of thought."48 Further, while from the definitions introduced into mathematics determinate objects can be constructed, this is not the case in philosophy, where the objects of knowledge are not our own constructs, and where our concepts give us only abstract and indeterminate knowledge of objects rather than de­ terminate and concrete objects themselves. Thus "in mathematics, the object is considered under sensible signs in concreto, whereas in philos­ ophy the object is only ever considered in universal abstracted con­ cepts."49 So mathematical knowledge is certain because it is grounded on definitions of our own construction and fully determinate because concrete objects can be constructed from those definitions, whereas philosophical knowledge is less certain because it is dependent on the analysis of given concepts and less determinate because it yields only general judgments about objects.
 
 Kant illustrates the differences between mathematical and philo­ sophical method with three examples. First, following Crusius, he ar­ gues that metaphysics depends not only on two distinct formal or logical principles (as Kant had already argued in 1755), but also on many "first material principles of human reason" that are "indemon­ strable," such as "a body is compound."50 Second, he reiterates his argu­ ment of the Only Possible Basis that from the argument for the existence of God as the ground of all possibility other predicates of God can be derived -this is supposed to show how from a certain though incom­ plete consciousness of some of a thing's characteristics other certain judgments can be derived -but also adds that in further judgments, about God's justice and goodness, only an "approximation to certainty" is possibleY Finally, about morality Kant argues that although we may easily be able to identify some formal principles of obligation, such as "I ought to advance the total greatest perfection," such principles are use­ less without material principles of obligation, which tell us what the ex­ tension of an abstract concept like perfection actually is -what courses of action actually contribute to perfection -and such material princi­ ples are themselves indemonstrableY Kant is here clearly working his way toward several of the central ideas of the Critique of Pure Reason. Although he does not yet speak of analytic or synthetic judg;ments, his distinction between analytic and synthetic methods is leading in that direction: whereas traditionally this contrast between methods was merely a contrast between direction in causal or syllogistic inference,53 for Kant the difference has become one between constructing concepts or their definitions (the synthetic method) and unpacking concepts to get to definitions (the analytical method). This will lead to the distinction between judgments that con33 Introduction struct fuller concepts by amplifying what is given (synthetic judgments) and those that merely explicate given concepts by showing what predi­ cates they already contain (analytic judgments) (see A6-7 IB IO-II).
