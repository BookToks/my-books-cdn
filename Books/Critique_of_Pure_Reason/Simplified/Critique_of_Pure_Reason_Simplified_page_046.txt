Philosophers can only understand their ideas by breaking them down, and this changes the way they think. In math, we start with clear definitions and can build exact objects from them. But in philosophy, we don’t create the things we study. Instead, our ideas give us only general and unclear knowledge about those things, not exact and detailed knowledge.

So, in math, we think about objects clearly and with real examples, while in philosophy, we only think about objects in a very general and abstract way. That’s why math knowledge is certain and exact because it’s based on our own clear definitions and objects we can build. Philosophy is less sure because it depends on analyzing ideas we didn’t make, and it only gives us general ideas about things.

Kant shows the difference between math and philosophy with three examples. First, he says metaphysics (a part of philosophy) depends on some basic ideas that we can’t prove, like “a body is made of parts.” Second, he explains that from the idea that God exists, we can figure out some things about God, but when we try to say things about God’s kindness or fairness, we can only be somewhat sure. Third, about right and wrong, Kant says we can find some basic rules, like “I should try to be the best I can,” but these rules don’t help much unless we know what actions actually make us better, and those ideas can’t be proven either.

Kant is starting to explain big ideas from his later work, the Critique of Pure Reason. He doesn’t yet talk about analytic or synthetic judgments by name, but he’s moving toward that. He sees two ways of thinking: one is building new ideas from definitions (synthetic), and the other is breaking down ideas to understand what they already mean (analytic). This helps explain how some judgments add new information, while others just explain what is already in the ideas.
