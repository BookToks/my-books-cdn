Let me explain the idea of giving a concept its special place in either what we sense or what we understand purely with our mind. We can call this special place its transcendental place. Figuring out this place for every concept, based on how we use it, and having clear rules to do this for all concepts is called the transcendental topic. This helps us avoid mistakes and confusion by always knowing which part of our mind the concepts belong to.

Every concept, or group of ideas, can also be called a logical place. This idea comes from Aristotle’s logical topics, which teachers and speakers used to find the best way to talk about a subject, sometimes just to sound smart. But the transcendental topic is different. It only includes four main ways to compare and sort ideas, which are not about the objects themselves, but about how the ideas come before we fully understand the things.

To compare ideas properly, we first need to think about where the ideas belong—whether they come from pure understanding or from what we sense. We can compare concepts logically without worrying about what kind of object they refer to. But if we want to understand the actual objects behind these concepts, we must first reflect on which part of the mind they belong to.

Without this reflection, using these concepts can be risky. This can lead to wrong conclusions that our reason won’t accept because we confuse the pure understanding of objects with how things just appear to us. Without the transcendental topic, people like the famous philosopher Leibniz made mistakes by mixing up these ideas.
