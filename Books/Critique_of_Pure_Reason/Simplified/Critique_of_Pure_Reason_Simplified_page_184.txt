You can’t enclose time in any shape, so you can’t draw a figure of it. If you try to make a shape just by thinking about straight lines and the number two, or even three lines, it won’t work. You have to rely on intuition, which is what geometry always does.

So, you imagine an object in your mind. But what kind of intuition is this? Is it something you know for sure before any experience, or is it something you learn from experience? If it was from experience, then you couldn’t be absolutely sure of any rules about it, because experience can’t give you that kind of certainty. 

You have to have a way to understand things before experience, and base your ideas on that. If you didn’t have the ability to understand things beforehand, and if space and time weren’t just the way your mind organizes what you see and feel, then you couldn’t say anything certain about objects.

If objects existed completely on their own, without depending on how you see them, you couldn’t add anything new to your idea of a triangle that must also be true about the triangle itself. Space and time are just the way your mind arranges things, and without these ways of organizing, you couldn’t know anything for sure about objects around you.

It is certain, not just possible, that space and time are just the ways we experience things, and that all objects are just appearances, not things as they really are. We can say a lot about how these appearances look, but nothing for sure about what the things really are.

No matter how you think about objects, the way you connect your thoughts to them is through intuition — the immediate way you see or feel something.
