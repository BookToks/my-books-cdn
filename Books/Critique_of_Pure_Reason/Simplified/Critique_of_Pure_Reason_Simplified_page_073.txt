A Critique like this would basically have included a theory about feelings, a theory about experience, and a problem with pure reason.

Kant clearly needed more time to understand the positive role of pure reason, which is only hinted at in these notes. But this isn’t the only way the early outline of the Critique from around 1777 is different from the final published work. There are several big differences. 

First, the "transcendental theory of experience," or the theory about how we use the concepts of understanding, wasn’t yet split into a part that explains the categories and a part that explains the rules for judging appearances, as it is in the final work. Second, all these notes suggest that the "Dialectic" only includes the four antinomies of pure reason, but in the published Critique the Dialectic is divided into three parts: the "Paralogism," "Antinomy," and "Ideal of Pure Reason." Can we learn why Kant made these extra divisions before the Critique finally took its final form in 1779 and 1780?

Luckily, some notes from 1776-78 still exist and help us understand the final development of Kant’s ideas about the Critique. In one note from this time, Kant first suggests that there might be a way to prove the categories are necessary for our awareness or unity of consciousness that doesn’t depend on time. Since this might be the first surviving idea of such a proof, separate from the one about the categories being needed to explain appearances (which Kant later called the "Analogies of Experience"), it’s worth sharing it in full:

In everything that happens or is given, we don’t just find awareness, but it must be necessary to show it as given. That means individual awareness must be connected to something universal. The universal means how it relates to others and the whole state. By being different from just random things, it is seen as given, and only by fitting it under the categories is it seen as something real. So, it must follow a rule that turns appearances into experiences and lets the mind understand it as one of its own actions of self-awareness, where, like in space and time, all data are found.
