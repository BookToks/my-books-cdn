Metaphysics is pretty lucky compared to other sciences that study things, because if it’s done right, it can cover everything it needs to completely. Unlike logic, which only deals with how we think in general, metaphysics deals with all the knowledge it’s supposed to. Once it’s set up properly, it can’t be added to or changed, since it focuses only on the basic rules and the limits those rules put on how we use them.

Because metaphysics is a basic science, it should be complete in this way. We should be able to say that nothing more needs to be done once it’s finished.

Now, some might ask: what’s the point of creating a perfect metaphysics that doesn’t change? At first, it might seem like it only tells us what we can’t do—like warning us not to guess about things beyond what we can experience. And that’s true, that’s its first job.

But soon, this warning becomes helpful in a good way. When we look closer, we see that the ideas that try to go beyond experience don’t actually help us think better. Instead, they make our thinking smaller by pushing us to try to understand things beyond what we can sense, which can mess up how we use practical reason.

So, this kind of critique is negative because it limits guessing beyond experience. But it’s also positive because it protects the important way we use reason in real life (like moral decisions). Pure reason naturally goes beyond what we can sense when dealing with morals, and it doesn’t need speculative ideas to do that. But it needs to be safe from those ideas, or else it could end up contradicting itself.
