Kant spent a lot of time over the next few years trying to figure out his idea that categories are basic, necessary parts of how we understand objects. He thought these categories were needed to make sense of the way we arrange and organize what we see and experience. These notes are from 1775 because one of them is written on a letter dated May 20, 1775. 

Before this, Kant had been thinking about the difference between logical and real relationships since the 1760s. But in these notes, he clearly connects his main philosophical question to the difference between two types of judgments: analytic and synthetic yet a priori. He asks when one quality (b) can be said to belong to an object (x) that already has another quality (a).

Sometimes, b can be said about any x that has a because b is already part of a. In this case, you don’t need to check anything to know it’s true. A statement like “All x’s that are a are also b” is true just by logic and is called analytic.

But if b and a are only connected through the object x, and not by logic alone, then the judgment is synthetic. This means the connection isn’t just about the meaning of words but about real things. Kant says that in synthetic judgments, the link between ideas isn’t direct like in analytic ones, but depends on how we experience things. He also hints that judgments about a priori concepts applying to what we sense are synthetic and show real connections.

Next, Kant says there are three ways to make synthetic judgments. The object x that links a and b can be created in pure intuition (like math), it can be given through what we experience with our senses, or it can be the condition inside us that helps us place a perception correctly. 

In math, x is something we build in our minds; in experience, it’s the actual thing we perceive; and in thinking, it’s the way our mind works to connect ideas. Kant clearly explains the first two options: building in the mind and getting information from experience.
