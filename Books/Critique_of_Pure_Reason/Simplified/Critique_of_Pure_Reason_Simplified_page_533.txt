Since the cosmological idea of totality doesn’t give us a final, absolute end to the chain of causes in the world we experience, this idea only works in a special way. It doesn’t prove that there is a last cause or ultimate thing out there for real. Instead, it acts as a problem or question for our mind to explore, helping us keep looking back through causes without stopping too soon.

In the world we see and feel, everything we find is connected to something else, because what we experience depends on space and time. Nothing we experience is completely independent or uncaused; it always has conditions that come before it. So, the rule of pure reason tells us to keep asking what caused something, but never to claim we’ve found an absolutely uncaused cause.

This rule isn’t about what we can actually experience or know for sure, and it’s not a rule for understanding the world directly. Instead, it’s a guideline that pushes us to keep exploring and expanding our experience. It says we shouldn’t accept any limit as the absolute end of the chain of causes. 

So, this idea is a rule for how we should think, encouraging us to keep searching for causes, but it doesn’t assume that the final cause or object exists before we start looking. That’s why it’s called a “regulative” principle—it guides our thinking without proving anything for real.
