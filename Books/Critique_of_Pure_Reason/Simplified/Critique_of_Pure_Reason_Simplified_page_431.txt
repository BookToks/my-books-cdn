Part II, Division Book II

Thoughts are different from physical things because they belong inside a thinking being. Imagine if a group of parts were thinking together. Each part would only have a piece of the thought, and only when all the parts come together would you get the whole thought. But this doesn’t make sense. Just like the words in a poem don’t make the whole poem by themselves, the thought can’t be split among many parts. So, a thought can only happen in one simple, single thing—not a bunch of parts put together.

The tricky part of this idea is the claim that many pieces have to be inside one single thinking being to make one thought. But no one can prove this just by thinking about it. How could someone even try? Saying "A thought can only happen in a completely united thinker" isn’t something you can figure out just by looking at the meaning of words.

When a thought has many parts, the unity of those parts is like a team working together, like how a body moves because all its parts move together. This teamwork can be seen as a combined unity, not just a single, simple thing. So, you can’t say for sure that a simple, single thinker is needed for a thought just by using logic. And no one can fully explain this from pure ideas alone.

Also, we can’t learn this for sure from experience. Experience doesn’t show us anything that absolutely must be true, and the idea of a single, simple thinker is too big for what experience can explain. So, where do we get this idea that the whole argument about thinking depends on?

It’s clear that if you want to imagine what a thinking being is like, you have to put yourself in their place and think like they do. This is different from other types of study. We say the thinker must be completely united because otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense to say:
