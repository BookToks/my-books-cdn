Transcendental ideas are really important and always useful, especially when it comes to real actions. Practical reason can actually cause things to happen based on its ideas. So, we can’t just say, "It’s only an idea." Because these ideas show the necessary connection between all possible goals, they must act as a rule or a basic limit for everything practical.

Even though transcendental ideas are just ideas, we shouldn’t think they are useless. Even if they don’t point to a specific object, they still help our understanding by giving us a guide to think more clearly and consistently. This doesn’t mean we learn about more objects, but we understand better. Also, these ideas might help us move from understanding nature to practical actions and support moral ideas and deeper thoughts about reason. We’ll learn more about this later.

For now, we will ignore practical ideas and focus only on reason used for thinking and understanding, especially in a special way called transcendental use. We will follow the same method we used before when we explained categories, by looking at how rational thinking works logically. This way, reason might give us new concepts about objects themselves, based on how reason functions.

Reason is like the skill of making logical guesses or judgments. It works by taking a known rule (called the major premise) and applying it to a specific case (the minor premise).

The final judgment is the conclusion, which states that the rule applies to this particular case. The rule says something is always true under certain conditions. So, if the case fits those conditions, we can say the rule is true for it too. Reason helps us understand things by connecting a chain of conditions. For example, I might conclude “All bodies can change” by starting with a more general understanding.
