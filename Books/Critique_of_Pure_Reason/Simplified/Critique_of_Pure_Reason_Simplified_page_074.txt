The unity of the mind is the condition of thinking, and the subordination of every particular under the universal is the condition of the possibility of associating a given representation with others through an action. Even if the rule is not immediately obvious, nev­ ertheless one must represent the object as amenable to a rule in order to con­ ceive it as that which represents something, i.e., something which has a determinate position and function among the other determinations . . . .
 
 '44 This note, which is very similar to a crucial passage in the version of the "Transcendental Deduction" published in the first edition of the Critique (A 108), is notable for two reasons.
 
 On the one hand, it clearly suggests that there must be general rules for the unity of consciousness that can be characterized independently of specific rules for time-determination, although the way remains open for a further inference that once the temporal character of the data for consciousness is considered, then these general rules may have given rise to further rules which are themselves temporal in content. Such a separation between the most general form of rules for the unity of con­ sciousness and the specific rules for the unity of a consciousness that is temporal in character, along with the necessity of explaining the rela­ tion between the two forms of rules, will be central to the organization of the Critique of Pure Reason, where Kant will offer: (I) a transcenden­ tal deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding as conditions of the possibility of any unity of consciousness in general, under the rubric of an "Analytic of Concepts"; (2) a derivation from those general rules of more specific rules for time-determination, under the rubric of a "Schematism of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding,"'45 which is in turn part of (3) the "Analytic of Principles," in which Kant argues for specific principles involving the temporally interpreted categories, such as the principles of the conservation of substance and of universal cau­ sation, as necessary conditions of objective time-determination.'46 The introduction of the concept of schematism, which Kant first records in a note from 1778-79 with the statement that "We must subject all of our pure concepts of the understanding to a schema, a way of putting the manifold together in space and time,"'47 is required precisely by the explicit separation between the transcendental deduction of the cate­ gories and the analogies of experience (and related arguments) by means of which Kant had previously derived the categories.
 
 On the other hand, this note also reveals a fundamental ambivalence about exactly how the categories are to be derived from the general idea of the "unity of consciousness," an ambiguity continuing one already found in the materials from I 775. In one strategy, rules are necessary to distinguish an arbitrary series of representations from the orderly or rule-governed series of representations by means of which a determi61 Introduction nate object is presented to consciousness; on this account, the "unity of consciousness" would mean the unity of consciousness characteristic of the presentation of an object.
