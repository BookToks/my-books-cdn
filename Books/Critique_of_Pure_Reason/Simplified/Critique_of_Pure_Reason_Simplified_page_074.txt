The mind needs to be united or connected for us to think clearly. To understand something, we have to see it as part of a bigger system or rule. Even if the rule isn’t obvious right away, we still have to think the object follows some rule so we can connect it with other ideas.

This idea connects to a key part of Kant’s work. He shows that there are general rules for how our mind stays united or focused that don’t depend on specific ideas about time. But when we think about time, these general rules can lead to more specific rules that involve time.

Kant explains this in his book, the Critique of Pure Reason. First, he talks about pure concepts that make any kind of unity in our mind possible. Then, from those general rules, he gets more specific rules that deal with time. Finally, he uses these rules to explain important principles, like how things keep their substance and cause effects in time.

Kant calls this process “schematism,” which means we have to connect our pure concepts to space and time so they make sense. This idea helps separate how we understand categories in general from how we experience them in time.

At the same time, Kant is not totally sure how exactly these categories come from the idea of the “unity of consciousness.” One way to see it is that rules help us tell the difference between random thoughts and organized ideas that show us a clear object. So, the “unity of consciousness” means our mind works as one when we focus on an object.
