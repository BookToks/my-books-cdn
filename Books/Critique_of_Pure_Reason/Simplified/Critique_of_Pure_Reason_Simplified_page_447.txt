Now, I’m saying that all the problems people think they have with these questions come from a trick of the mind. They treat things that exist only in thoughts as if they are real objects outside of us. They take something called extension—which is just how things seem to take up space—and pretend it’s a real property of things outside our senses. They also think motion is something happening outside of us, when really it’s just how things appear to us.

Matter, which many people worry doesn’t connect well with the soul, is actually just a kind of way we represent an unknown object through what we call outer sense. So, there might be something outside of us that we call matter, but in the way it appears, it’s not really outside us—it’s just a thought inside us. This thought, through outer sense, makes it look like it’s outside.

Matter doesn’t mean a totally different kind of stuff from the soul, which we know from inner sense. Instead, it means the difference in how things appear—some seem outside (outer sense), and some seem inside (inner sense). But both kinds of appearances belong to the thinking subject, like other thoughts. The tricky thing is that outer appearances seem to be outside the soul because they show objects in space, but space itself is only a way we represent things. You won’t find space outside your mind.

So, the real question isn’t about how the soul connects with other different things outside us, but about how our inner thoughts and outer feelings work together following certain rules, making one experience.

As long as we see inner and outer appearances as just parts of experience, nothing is strange about how they connect. But if we start thinking outer appearances are real things outside us existing by themselves, and then try to connect their actions to our thinking, that’s when problems start.
