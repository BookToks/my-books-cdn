Logicians are right when they say that in syllogisms, singular judgments can be treated like universal ones. This is because singular judgments don’t have a specific group they apply to. Their predicate (what they say about the subject) applies to the subject concept completely, just like in a universal judgment where the predicate applies to everything under that concept.

But if we compare a singular judgment to a universal one just as a piece of knowledge, looking at how much it covers, then the singular judgment is like one unit compared to something infinite. So, they are basically very different. If we think about singular judgments not just for their internal truth, but also how much knowledge they give compared to other judgments, then they are definitely different from universal judgments and should have their own special place when we study all kinds of thinking. However, this doesn’t apply to logic that only looks at how judgments relate to each other.

Also, in more advanced logic called transcendental logic, infinite judgments must be separated from affirmative ones. In regular logic, infinite judgments are grouped with affirmative ones and don’t get a special category. Regular logic ignores what the predicate actually means and only checks if it’s said to belong to the subject or not. But transcendental logic looks at what the judgment really says and what it adds to our understanding.

For example, if I say “The soul is not mortal,” I avoid making a mistake by using a negative judgment. This statement is an actual logical affirmation because it puts the soul into the group of beings that never die. Since mortal beings are only part of all possible beings, and undying beings are the rest, this judgment tells us something important about the soul.
