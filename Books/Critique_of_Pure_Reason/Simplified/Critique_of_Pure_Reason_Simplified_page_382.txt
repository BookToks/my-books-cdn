2. Agreement and opposition. If reality is understood only through pure thinking (realitas noumenon), then you can’t imagine two realities being completely opposite in a way that they cancel each other out when combined, like in A26S 3 - 3 a.a,101. 

But realities we see or experience (realitas phaenomenon) can definitely be opposite. When they come together in the same thing, one can partly or fully cancel out what the other causes. It’s like two forces moving along the same line but pushing or pulling in opposite directions, or like feeling happiness that balances out pain.

The inner and the outer. In something understood by pure thinking, what’s inside has no connection (about existence) to anything else outside it. 

But the inside parts of a physical thing we see in space are just relationships. The whole thing is just a bunch of connections. We only know a physical substance through forces that work in it, like attraction (pulling things in) or repulsion (keeping things out). We don’t really know other qualities that make up matter.

For something understood by pure thinking, every substance must have inner parts and forces that belong to its real inner nature. But what can I think of as inner traits except those my inner feeling shows me—like something that’s either thinking or similar to thinking?

Because he thought of these as noumena (things understood by pure thinking), removing everything that means outside connection, Leibniz made all substances—even parts of matter—simple things with the power to represent, which he called monads.

4. Matter and form. These are two ideas that form the basis of all other thinking.
