It just hides mistakes and errors, and tricks philosophy, which should clearly show every step of thinking. Still, the method can be organized. Our reason itself is like a system, but when used purely with ideas alone, it’s only a way to research based on unity, and experience is needed for the content.

We can’t talk here about the special method of transcendental philosophy because we’re only looking at whether we can even build knowledge and how far we can go using pure ideas we have beforehand.

Reason must always be checked in everything it does and can’t stop this checking by forbidding it, or else it would harm itself and make people doubt it. Nothing is so useful or important that it should be left out of this careful review, which treats everyone the same. Reason’s very existence depends on this freedom, which doesn’t force anyone but needs everyone to agree. Everyone must be able to say their doubts or even say no without holding back.

Even though reason can’t refuse to be checked, it doesn’t always have to be afraid of it. When reason is used in a strict, dogmatic way (not like math), it isn’t always careful enough to follow its highest rules and so can only face a higher, judging reason with humility, giving up any claims to absolute authority.

But it’s different when reason isn’t judged by a strict judge but has to answer other people’s opinions, which it just needs to defend itself against. Since those people can be just as dogmatic in saying no as reason is in saying yes, reason can have a good explanation that protects it from interference and gives it a right to its ideas that no one can question.
