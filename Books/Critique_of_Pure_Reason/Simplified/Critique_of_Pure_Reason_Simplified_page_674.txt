Using fancy ideas beyond what we can experience to explain things is never okay. This is because these ideas don’t help us understand more; instead, they stop us from making real progress. Also, relying on such ideas can ruin the benefits we get from learning through experience. When nature is hard to explain, some people use these far-out ideas to avoid doing the hard work of figuring things out. This stops real understanding because they assume something that’s too complicated and unclear from the start.

The second important thing about a good idea is that it should clearly show what results will happen before we check them. If we need extra made-up ideas to make it work, then those ideas seem like guesses. Each guess needs proof just like the main idea, so they don’t really help us trust the explanation. For example, if we believe there is a perfect cause behind everything in the world, then the bad or messy parts we see need even more guesses to protect that belief. If we say the human soul is simple and independent, but then notice problems because it changes like physical things do, we might add new guesses. These guesses might sound believable but have no real proof except the original idea they try to support.

If the ideas we talked about (like the soul being a single spirit and a highest being existing) aren’t guesses but are proven for sure, then there’s no problem. But in that case, the proof needs to be super strong and certain. It would be silly to say these ideas are only probably true without strong evidence.
