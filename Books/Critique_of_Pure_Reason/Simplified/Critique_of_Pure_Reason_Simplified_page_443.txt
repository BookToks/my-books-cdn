Here’s the passage rewritten in simple, clear English for a teenager, keeping the same number of sentences and dividing it into paragraphs:

Whatever is connected to what we sense, according to the rules of experience, is actually just this trick. Both idealism and dualism deal with this because it’s all about how we experience things.

To prove that empirical idealism is wrong, it’s enough to show that when we sense things outside us, it proves there really is space. Space itself is just a way we understand things, but it’s real when it comes to everything we see outside ourselves (which are also just ways we represent things). It’s also enough to show that without sensing, we couldn’t even have dreams or imagine stuff. So, our outer senses must be connected to real things in space.

A dogmatic idealist is someone who says matter doesn’t exist, while a skeptical idealist just doubts matter because they think we can’t prove it. The dogmatic idealist believes matter can’t be possible because they think it leads to contradictions. We’re not talking about that right now. The next part will help explain these ideas better.

The skeptical idealist just questions the reasons why we say matter exists and thinks our proof, which is based on what we sense, isn’t strong enough. But this is actually helpful because it forces us to pay close attention to even the smallest parts of our experience and not just accept things without thinking.

These idealistic ideas help us see that all perceptions—whether inside our minds or outside—are just how we become aware of something that depends on our senses. We should think of the things we sense not as real things by themselves, but as images or ideas in our mind. We call them external because they come through the sense we call outer sense, which understands space. But space itself is just a way our mind represents things, where certain perceptions are connected.

If we say that objects outside us are things as they really are, then it’s impossible to understand how we can know they’re real outside of us since all we have is the image or idea inside us. We can only feel or sense things inside ourselves, so all our self-awareness is just about what’s inside us. Skeptical idealism points this out clearly.
