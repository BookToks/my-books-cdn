Appearances are what we think of as objects based on how our mind groups things together. These are called phenomena. But imagine there are things that only our mind understands and can picture, but not through our sensesâ€”these are called noumena.

You might think that just by looking at appearances, we can prove that noumena exist. This would mean there are two types of things: things we sense (phenomena) and things we understand without sensing (noumena). This would also mean the world is split into the world we see and the world we think about.

If our senses only show us how things appear, then there must be real things behind those appearances that we can understand without using our senses. This kind of understanding would show us things as they really are, not just how they seem.

So, besides using our senses to understand things, there could be a pure way to understand objects that is totally real and valid. This would open up a whole new way of thinking, like a world made just of ideas, which could be even more important than what we learn from our senses.

All our thoughts are connected to objects through our understanding. And since appearances are just how things show up to us, they depend on our mind organizing them.
