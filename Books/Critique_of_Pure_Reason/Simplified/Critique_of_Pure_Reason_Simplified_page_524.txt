We have already shown that everything we see or feel in space and time—basically, everything we can experience—is just how things appear to us. These are just mental images or representations. They don’t exist on their own outside of our minds. This idea is called transcendental idealism.

Some people, called realists, believe these things we experience actually exist by themselves, outside of our minds. They think the images we have are the actual things themselves.

But it would be wrong to say we believe in the old idea of empirical idealism, which says space is real but doubts that things in space really exist. That old idea even says it’s hard to tell if what we see is a dream or real. When it comes to our inner feelings and thoughts in time, that old idea says those are definitely real and prove that their objects exist for sure.

Our idea, transcendental idealism, says that the things we see outside are real too, just as we experience them in space and time. Since space is how we experience outer things, and without things in space we wouldn’t have any experience at all, we have to accept that objects in space are real. The same goes for time.

But space and time themselves, and everything that appears in them, are not things by themselves. They are just representations and can’t exist outside our minds. Even the way we feel inner experiences is just how our mind represents them.
