His first point is that different people might see things in different ways. But just because that’s true, it doesn’t mean everyone sees things wrong. Maybe some people, like us, see things the right way.

His second point is that the way we think about things can’t show objects as they really are because our minds have their own rules. But there are two problems with this: first, no one has proven that the rules in our mind can’t also match rules in the objects themselves. Second, since our ideas are also made by the mind’s rules, it seems like those ideas only show us how things look to us, not how they really are. Later, Kant will give more reasons for his idea called “transcendental idealism.” Whether these reasons depend on the idea that what we sense and how we think are only personal and not true for objects themselves is an important question.

Finally, there are big questions about how Kant describes the “intellect” or mind. He thinks we only need the “logical” part of the mind to make sense of what we see and experience. He also thinks the “real” part of the mind can give us knowledge about things we don’t see. But after 1772, Kant changes his mind about this.

First, he realizes that the ideas the mind makes about things we don’t see, like “possibility” or “cause,” need real experiences to make sense. Just thinking about them isn’t enough. Second, he decides that these ideas alone can’t give us real knowledge about things we don’t sense, like God. But those ideas can help us think about such things in a way that makes sense morally.

Because of these big changes, Kant also changes the words he uses. At first, he talks about one mind with a “real” and a “logical” use. Later, in his book called the Critique, he splits the mind into two parts: understanding and reason. Understanding is the part that gives us basic ideas we need to understand what we sense, so it’s useful only for things we can experience. Since Kant still believes our senses only show us appearances, the understanding’s “real” use is only for appearances, not things as they are in themselves.
