So, idealism—at least the tricky kind—is something you can’t avoid in this way of thinking. If you don’t need things outside yourself to prove you exist over time, then you’re just assuming those outside things without any real proof.

But if we instead start from the idea “I think,” which already means “I exist,” and then carefully look at what that means, we can figure out if and how this “I” exists in space or time just by itself. This way, ideas about the soul don’t start from just thinking about any thinking being, but from a real, actual thinking self. Then, after we remove everything that comes from experience, we can see what belongs to every thinking being, like the table below shows.

1. I think,  
2. as a subject,  
3. as a simple subject,  
4. as the same subject in every part of my thinking.

In the second point, it’s not clear if “I” can exist just as a subject alone or if it has to be connected to something else. So here, “subject” is just a logical idea, and we don’t know if it means a substance or not. But in the third point, the idea of a thinking nature being totally one thing is shown.

If this is true, then why can’t a materialist be just as confident, even though they can’t prove their ideas with experience either? They could keep the formal idea of unity but use it in a different way.
