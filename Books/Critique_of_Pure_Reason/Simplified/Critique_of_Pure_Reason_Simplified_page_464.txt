But from this it follows that idealism, at least problematic idealism, is unavoidable in that same rationalistic system, and if the existence of external things is not at all required for the determination of one's own existence in time, then such things are only assumed, entirely gratuitously, without a proof of them being able to be given.
 
 If, on the contrary, we follow the analytic procedure, grounded on the "I think" given as a proposition that already includes existence in itself, and hence grounded on modality, and then we take it apart so as to cognize its content, whether and how this I determines its existence in space or time merely through it, then the propositions of the ratiortal doctrine of the soul begin not from the concept of a thinking being in general but from an actuality; and from the way this is thought, after everything empirical has been detached from it, it is concluded what B419 pertains to a thinking being in general, as the following table shows.
 
 1.
 
 I think, 2. 3· as subject, as simple subject, 4· as identical subject in every state of my thinking.
 
 Now because in the second proposition here it is not determined whether I could exist and be thought of only as subject and not as pred­ icate of another thing, the concept of a subject is here taken merely log­ ically, and it remains undetermined whether or not substance is to be understood by it. Yet in the third proposition the absolute unity of apa thinking nature, then why should not the materialist, even though he can just as little present any experience in behalf of his possibilities, be justified in an equal boldness, retaining the rationalist's formal unity while putting his own principle to an opposite use?
