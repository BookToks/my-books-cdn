Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III talks about the idea of a most real being. You say this being has all reality, and it makes sense to think such a being could exist (I agreed to this so far, even though just not contradicting yourself doesn’t prove it really can exist). 

Existence is part of what makes something real. So, if something is possible, it must include existence in its idea. If you say it doesn’t exist, then you’re saying it’s not even possible, which doesn’t make sense.

I respond: You made a mistake when you included existence in the idea of something you only wanted to think of as possible. If I let you do that, it might seem like you won, but you actually just repeated the same idea in a different way. Now tell me, when you say “This thing exists,” is that just explaining the idea (analytic) or giving new information (synthetic)?

If it’s just explaining the idea, then saying it exists doesn’t add anything new. Either your idea already means it exists, or you assumed existence is part of possibility and then used that to prove existence — which is just repeating yourself. Using the word “reality” instead of “existence” doesn’t help. If you call all kinds of existence “reality,” then you’ve already included everything about the thing in your idea and just repeated it again. But if you admit that existence statements are synthetic (adding new info), then how can you say you can’t deny existence without contradiction? Only analytic statements have that kind of certainty.

I wanted to end this tricky argument quickly by saying: A concept is always possible if it doesn’t contradict itself. That’s how we know something is logically possible, and it’s different from nothing. But a concept can still be empty if we haven’t shown it can exist in real life. And proving real existence depends on principles about what we can experience, not just on logic. So, be careful not to think that just because a concept is logically possible, the thing must be really possible.

I almost stopped here without extra details, but I found that the mistake people make is mixing up existence as a logical idea with real existence.
