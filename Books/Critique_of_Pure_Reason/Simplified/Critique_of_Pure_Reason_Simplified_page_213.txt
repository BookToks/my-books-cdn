Part II. Transcendental Logic can't be given to us in any way. It should only be a guide to help us judge how we use experience. It's wrong to use it as a tool for making general decisions about things just by pure thinking alone.

Using pure understanding like that leads to confusion. So, the second part of transcendental logic has to be a critique of this confusion. This part is called transcendental dialectic. Itâ€™s not about encouraging false ideas (which sadly happens a lot in tricky metaphysical writings). Instead, it looks closely at how understanding and reason go beyond what they should, to show that their big claims have no real basis.

It helps to limit these claims, which are often just made up or exaggerated, and instead focuses on properly judging pure understanding. It protects us from being fooled by clever but false arguments.

The first part of Transcendental Logic is called the Transcendental Analytic. This part breaks down all of our a priori knowledge into simple pieces of pure understanding.
