If the idea that objects can be understood in two ways—either as they appear to us or as they really are—is correct, and if the way we understand pure concepts is right, then the rule of cause and effect only applies to things as we experience them, not to things as they are in themselves. 

This means that our will, or what we decide to do, seems to follow natural laws when we look at our actions, so it’s not free in that sense. But at the same time, the will can be seen as part of the thing itself, which isn’t controlled by natural laws, so in that sense, it is free. There’s no contradiction here.

I can’t fully understand my soul or freedom by thinking alone or by observing the world, because freedom would have to exist outside of time, which I can’t imagine or prove. But I can still think about freedom without it being contradictory, as long as I remember the difference between how things appear to us and how they are in themselves.

Now, if being moral depends on having true freedom in our will, and if this freedom is based on certain basic principles in our reason, then if someone said freedom can’t be thought of at all, moral ideas would have to give way to natural laws controlling everything. But since morality just needs freedom to be at least possible without contradicting itself, it doesn’t have to conflict with natural laws.

Because of this, morality and nature each have their own place. This understanding only happened because we realized we can’t fully know things as they are in themselves and that all we really know are appearances. 

The same kind of explanation could be given about ideas like God or the simple nature of our soul, but I won’t go into that now to keep things short.
