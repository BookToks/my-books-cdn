If we got rid of transcendental freedom, we would also lose all practical freedom. Practical freedom means that even if something hasn’t happened yet, it should happen. This means that the cause of something isn’t so controlling that we can’t choose freely. We can make decisions on our own, separate from natural causes, and start new events by ourselves.

Usually, when reason argues with itself about things beyond what we can experience, the problem isn’t about the body or brain but about deeper ideas. So, questions about freedom challenge psychology, but since they come from pure reason, only transcendental philosophy can solve them. To help transcendental philosophy answer this, I need to explain how it approaches the problem.

If appearances were things as they truly are, and space and time were the forms of things themselves, then causes and effects would always be part of one long chain. This would create a problem where this chain is either too long or too short for us to understand. But the ideas of reason we’re looking at don’t think about size or amount, only about whether something exists. So, we can ignore the length of the chain and just focus on how causes and effects relate.

The real question is whether freedom can exist at all, and if it can, whether it can happen alongside natural laws. We need to know if every event must come either from nature or freedom, or if both can happen at the same time in different ways. We already know that all events follow natural laws, and this won’t change. So, the only question is whether freedom can exist despite this.
