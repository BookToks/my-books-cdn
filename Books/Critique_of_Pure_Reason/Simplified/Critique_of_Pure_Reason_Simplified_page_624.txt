Criticizing all ideas about God that are just guesses makes sure they are right. The main idea behind these guesses is real but unclear. It doesn’t tell us exactly what something is, but it helps guide us to use reason better. It opens up new ways to think about things we don’t fully understand yet, without breaking any rules of how we learn from experience.

But reason can only imagine this perfect system by giving it an object, even though we can’t find this object in real life. We never see a perfect example of this system in experience. This idea is just a thought, not something we believe actually exists for sure. We use it as a kind of guess to help connect everything we see in the world, so that reason can work better with what we understand from experience. It helps us make sense of things without getting in the way.

People often get this idea wrong if they think it means a real thing actually exists that explains how the world is put together. But really, we don’t know what this ground is like. We just have the idea so we have a starting point to help reason bring everything together. This idea is like a tool that helps reason organize all our experiences.

The first thing this idea points to is me, just as a thinking being (my mind or soul). If I want to understand what it means to be a thinking thing, I have to look at experience. But I can’t use all my usual ways of thinking unless I can also feel or sense it somehow. Because of this, I can never fully figure out how all my inner thoughts fit together perfectly.

So, instead of just thinking about experience as what the soul actually does...
