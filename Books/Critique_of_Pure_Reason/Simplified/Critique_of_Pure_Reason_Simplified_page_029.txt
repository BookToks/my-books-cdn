The "Antinomies." The longest and most detailed part of the "Transcendental Dialectic" is called the "Antinomy of Pure Reason." It talks about questions in rational cosmology. Kant thought that all the mistakes in metaphysics could be shown through these antinomies.

Kant says that reason’s natural mistakes don’t just show up through careful thinking but actually appear as real contradictions. Each side of these contradictions seems believable. He says that unless we accept the idea that the world we experience is different from things as they really are, we will have to accept arguments that can’t both be true. For example, some arguments say the world must have a first beginning in time, while others say it can’t. Some say the world must have limits in space, others say it can’t. There are also arguments about whether there must be a simple substance or not, whether there must be a first cause or not, and whether there must be a necessary being or not.

Kant says the only way to solve these contradictions is to accept that the world we experience is made up of appearances, shaped by how our minds understand space and time, not by things as they really are. About the first two antinomies, which he calls "mathematical" because they deal with size and time, Kant says there is no definite answer about the size of the whole world. That’s because we never experience the whole world at once. We only understand it bit by bit, by adding or breaking down parts of space and time. We can keep imagining bigger or smaller spaces forever, but we never reach a real beginning or end. So both sides of these mathematical antinomies are wrong because they assume the world has a fixed size, which it doesn’t.
