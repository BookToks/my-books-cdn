Criticism of all ideas about God that are just guesses starts from a certain point of view, which has its own limits. This point of view includes many things you can think about and look at. Inside these limits, there are endless points, and each point has its own smaller view. In other words, every group has smaller groups inside it, following a rule about how things get more specific. The big picture is made up only of smaller pictures, not of single things without a group. But different big groups, which come from different ideas, can be imagined as part of one larger picture. You can look at this bigger picture from the middle point, which is the highest group. Finally, the biggest group is the universal and true picture, made from the highest idea and including all kinds of groups and smaller groups inside it.

The rule of similarity leads me to this highest point, while the rule of making things more specific leads to all the smaller groups and their many varieties. Since nothing is missing in all the possible ideas, and outside them there is nothing, this universal view and its detailed division create this rule: there is no empty space between groups. This means there aren’t different main groups that are completely separate from each other; instead, all groups are just parts of one big universal group. From this rule, another rule comes: there is a continuous connection between all kinds of groups. You can’t jump from one group to another without going through smaller differences. So, from one group, you can reach another by passing through groups that are closer to each other. In short, there are no groups or subgroups next to each other without something in between. The differences between these in-between groups are smaller than the difference between the first two groups.

The first rule stops there from being too many original groups and wants things to be the same kind. The second rule stops everything from being the same and says you have to notice smaller groups before looking at individuals with general ideas. The third rule joins the first two by saying that even with many different groups, there is a kind of sameness because you can move step by step from one group to another.
