At any moment, what we see or think about is always one complete thing. To understand something like space, we first have to notice all the different parts and then put them together in our mind. This process of putting parts together is called the synthesis of apprehension. It helps us take many pieces and turn them into one clear idea.

This way of combining things has to happen before we experience anything new. Without it, we couldn't understand space or time, because these ideas come from putting together what our senses give us. So, we have a pure way of putting things together in our minds.

Next, there’s something called the synthesis of reproduction in our imagination.

This means that when we often see or think about things in a certain order, our mind learns to connect them. Even when the thing isn’t there, thinking about one thing helps us think about the next one. This happens because there’s a kind of rule in how things usually appear or happen.

If things were always changing randomly—like a red rock suddenly turning black or a person turning into different animals—our imagination wouldn’t be able to work properly. Or if words meant different things all the time without any pattern, we couldn’t link ideas in our minds.

So, there has to be something that makes it possible for us to put these experiences together in a meaningful way.
