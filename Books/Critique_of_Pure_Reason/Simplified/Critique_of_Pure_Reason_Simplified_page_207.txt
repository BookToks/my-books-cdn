Part II. Transcendental Logic

Concepts in our mind alone don’t mean much without something to connect them to, like pictures or experiences. Just like we need to understand what we sense by putting it into ideas, we also need to make ideas clear by linking them to what we sense. The mind’s understanding and our senses can’t do each other’s jobs. The mind can’t just see things, and our senses can’t think on their own. Only when they work together can we really know something.

Because of this, we should keep their roles separate and understand how they are different. That’s why we have two kinds of science: one about how we sense things (called aesthetics) and one about how we think logically (called logic).

Logic itself has two parts. One is about the basic rules of thinking that everyone needs, no matter what they are thinking about. This is called elementary logic. The other part is about specific rules for thinking about certain subjects, like science rules for a particular field. Schools usually teach these rules before the science itself, but actually, you need to know a lot about the subject first before you can understand these specific rules.

General logic can be pure or applied. Pure logic ignores anything that comes from our senses or feelings, like memories or habits. It just focuses on the rules of thinking that are always true, no matter what we’re thinking about. Applied logic, on the other hand, looks at how we actually use our understanding in real life, including how our feelings and experiences affect our thinking. This kind of logic uses ideas from psychology to explain how we think in everyday situations.
