In the book Critique of Pure Reason, Kant talks about a group of tricky problems called the antinomies of pure reason. These problems are about understanding the difference between things as we see them (phenomena) and things as they really are (noumena).

But Kant changed how he dealt with these problems between 1770 and 1781.

This change is linked to how he thought about two mental abilities: intuition (how we directly experience things) and conceptualization (how we think about things). At first, Kant believed that only the intellect could show us the true nature of reality. He thought the antinomies could be solved by not confusing the limits of our senses with limits on what the mind can know. However, he didn’t fully understand how concepts help us know everyday things in space and time.

After 1772, he realized that concepts and sensory experiences work together to help us understand the world. Because of this, he had to change how he explained the antinomies.

He started saying that we can’t know anything about reality beyond what we can sense in space and time. But when it comes to ideas like God, which go beyond space and time, we can believe in them, even if we can’t truly know them.

In short, Kant first made a basic difference between intuition and concepts and used that to solve the antinomies. But he didn’t yet see that knowledge comes from using both together. When he realized this, he had to change his solution, giving up the idea that our senses give us knowledge of appearances and the mind gives us knowledge of things as they really are.

Only after this could Kant develop his full idea that the limits of knowledge leave room for some beliefs that we can’t know for sure but can still be reasonable to hold.
