This is about dialectic, which means a way of thinking or arguing. It doesn’t teach us anything about what we actually know, but only about the rules for agreeing with our understanding. These rules don’t care about the real things we think about. So, using dialectic as a tool to get more information, or even pretending to do so, is just empty talk. People can say whatever they want and make it sound believable without real proof.

This kind of thinking doesn’t suit philosophy well. It’s better to see "dialectic" as a warning against being tricked by false arguments, which is part of logic. That’s what we should understand here.

Next, there is something called transcendental logic. This focuses only on the part of our thinking that comes from understanding, just like before we focused on how we sense things. But for this thinking to work, we need objects given to us through our senses. Without sensing, our thoughts would have no real things to connect to and would be empty.

One part of transcendental logic explains the basic rules of pure understanding and the principles we must have to think about any object at all. This part is called transcendental analytic, and it is a logic about truth. If our thinking breaks these rules, it loses all connection to real objects and all truth.

However, it’s tempting to use these pure rules of understanding alone, even beyond what we can actually experience. But experience is the only thing that gives us the real stuff (objects) to apply these pure concepts to. If we don’t have real objects, the understanding can make mistakes by using these rules in a wrong way, judging things that aren’t given to us, which can lead to false conclusions.
