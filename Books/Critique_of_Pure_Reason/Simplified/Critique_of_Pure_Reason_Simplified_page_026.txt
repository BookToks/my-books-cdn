A fundamental point of the Critique is to deny that we ever have knowl­ edge of things through pure reason alone, but only by applying the cat­ egories to pure or empirical data structured by the forms of intuition.
 
 At this point in the Critique Kant has completed the largest part of his constructive project, showing how synthetic a priori principles of theo­ retical cognition are the necessary conditions of the application of the categories to sensible data structured by the pure forms of intuition.
 
 The next part of his argument is the critical demonstration that tradi­ tional metaphysics consists largely of illusions arising from the attempt to acquire knowledge of all things (the soul, the world as a whole, and God) as they are in themselves by the use of reason alone regardless of the limits of sensibility. The bulk of this argument is reserved for the "Transcendental Dialectic," but Kant makes a start on it with the inter­ esting appendix that completes the "Transcendental Analytic" entitled the "Amphiboly of Concepts of Reflection" (AI6o-92/B316-49). In this appendix Kant presents his criticism of Leibniz's monadology by arguing that through a confusion (or "amphiboly") Leibniz has taken mere features of concepts through which we think things, specifically concepts of comparison or reflection such as "same" and "different" or "inner" and "outer," which are in fact never applied directly to things but only applied to them through more determinate concepts, as if they were features of the objects themselves. Kant thereby rejects the Leibnizian-Wolffian account of such metaphysical concepts as essence, identity, and possibility, and reinforces his own insistence that empiri­ cal individual judgments of real possibility require sensible conditions in addition to logical intelligibility and non-contradictoriness.
 
 The "Transcendental Dialectic": the critique of metaphysics.
 
 The second division of the "Transcendental Logic" turns to the main destructive task of the Critique of Pure Reason, and that which gives it its name, the task of discrediting dogmatism and displaying the limits of metaphysics. The "Transcendental Analytic" has prepared the way for this critique of traditional metaphysics and its foundations by its argu­ ment that synthetic a priori principles can be established only within the limited domain of sensible experience. But Kant's aim in the "Dialectic" is not only to show the failure of a metaphysics that transcends the boundaries of possible experience. At the same time, he also wants to demonstrate that the questions that preoccupy metaphysics are in­ evitable, and that the arguments of metaphysics, although deceptive, should not be dismissed without sympathetic comprehension (as they are by the tr,�ditional skeptic). Kant argues that they tempt us for gen13 Introduction uine reasons, inherent in the nature of human reason itself, and when these grounds are properly understood they can be put to good use for the causes of both human knowledge and human morality.
