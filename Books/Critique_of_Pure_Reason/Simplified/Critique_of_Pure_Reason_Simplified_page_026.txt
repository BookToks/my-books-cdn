A key idea in the Critique is that we never really know things just by thinking alone. Instead, we only understand things by using categories (ways of organizing) on information we get through our senses, shaped by how we naturally see and feel the world.

At this point, Kant has mostly finished his main project. He shows that certain important ideas we know before experience (called synthetic a priori principles) are necessary for making sense of the data we get through our senses, using the categories and our natural ways of understanding.

Next, Kant starts to explain why traditional metaphysics (the study of big questions about the soul, the whole world, and God) is mostly based on mistakes. These mistakes come from trying to know everything by reason alone, ignoring what our senses can tell us. Most of this argument is in the "Transcendental Dialectic," but Kant begins it with an appendix called the "Amphiboly of Concepts of Reflection."

In this part, Kant criticizes Leibniz’s idea of monads (basic units of reality). He says Leibniz got confused by mixing up how we think about things with how things really are. For example, concepts like "same" and "different" are ways we compare ideas, but they aren’t actual features of objects themselves. Because of this, Kant rejects Leibniz’s ideas about essence, identity, and possibility and insists that real possibilities need both logical sense and conditions we can experience with our senses.

The "Transcendental Dialectic" is the part of the Critique that attacks metaphysics.

The second part of the "Transcendental Logic" focuses on the main goal of the Critique of Pure Reason: to challenge dogmatic beliefs and show the limits of metaphysics. The earlier part, the "Transcendental Analytic," prepared the way by showing that certain important principles only work when applied to things we can experience.

But in the "Dialectic," Kant doesn’t just want to prove that metaphysics fails when it tries to go beyond experience. He also wants to show that the big questions metaphysics asks are unavoidable. Even though metaphysical arguments can be misleading, we shouldn’t just dismiss them like traditional skeptics do. Kant says these questions are tempting because of how human reason works. If we understand these reasons well, we can use them to help improve both human knowledge and morality.
