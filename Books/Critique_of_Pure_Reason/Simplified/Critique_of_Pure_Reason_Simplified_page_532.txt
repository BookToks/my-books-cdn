When we think about the universe, we have to decide if it is either limited or unlimited. But these ideas only exist because we keep breaking things down into smaller parts. Before we do that, and if we think about things on their own, they can't really exist by themselves.

So, the problem that reason has with the universe is actually just a kind of confusion. This confusion happens because we try to apply the idea of the universe being complete and absolute to things we only see as appearances or images in our minds. These appearances only exist as part of a series, one after another, but by themselves, they don’t really exist.

However, we can still learn something useful from this confusion. It helps us understand that appearances, or what we see and sense, aren’t real things on their own but are just how things look to us. This is called their “transcendental ideality.”

This is important because it shows that the arguments about whether the universe is finite or infinite are not just fake problems. They are based on the wrong idea that appearances are real things in themselves.

The conflict in these arguments helps us realize that this idea is false and teaches us more about what things really are when we see or sense them. So, this kind of reasoning doesn’t make us skeptical about everything, but it does support being careful and questioning our thoughts. Even if arguments don’t give us all the answers, they still help us improve the way we think.
