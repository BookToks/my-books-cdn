Pt. II. Div. 1. Bk. II. Appendix way in which the objecta exists in itself (noumenon), without regard to the intuition to which our sensibility is limited.
 
 A290 * * * Before we leave the Transcendental Analytic behind, we must add something that, although not in itself especially indispensable, never­ theless may seem requisite for the completeness of the system. The highest concept with which one is accustomed to begin a transcenden­ tal philosophy is usually the division between the possible and the im­ possible. But since every division presupposes a concept that is to be "4 divided, a still higher one must be given, and this is the concept of an object in general (taken problematically, leaving undecided whether it is something or nothing). Since the categories are the only concepts that relate to objects in general, the distinction of whether an object is some­ thing or nothing must proceed in accordance with the order and guid­ ance of the categories.b,lls B347 I) To the concepts of all, many, and one there is opposed the con­ cept of that which cancels everything out, i.e., none, and thus the object of a concept to which no intuition that can be given corre­ sponds is == nothing, ie., a concept without an object, like the noumena, which cannot be counted among the possibilities al­ though they must not on that ground be asserted to be impossible (ens rationis),c or like something such as certain new fundamental A291 forces, which one thinks, without contradiction, to be sure, but also without any example from experience even being thought, and which must therefore not be counted among the possibilities.
 
 2) Reality is something, negation is nothing, namely, a concept of the absence of an object, such as a shadow or cold (nihil privativum). d 3) The mere form of intuition, without substance, is in itself not an object, but the merely formal condition of one (as appearance), like pure space and pure time, which are to be sure something, as the forms for intuiting, but are not in themselves objects that are intuited (ens imaginarium).e B 348 4) The object of a concept that contradicts itself is nothing be­ cause the concept is nothing, the impossible, like a rectilinear fig­ ure with two sides (nihil negativum)/ a Object b In�erted in Kant's copy of the first edition: "the highest concept is that of the object in general" (E CLI, p. 46; 23:38).
