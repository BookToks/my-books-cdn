Before we finish talking about the Transcendental Analytic, there’s one more thing to add. It’s not super important, but it helps make the whole system feel complete. Usually, when starting a transcendental philosophy, people begin by dividing things into possible and impossible. But to make this division, you need an even bigger idea first — the idea of an object in general. This means something that might or might not be real. Since categories are the only ideas that deal with objects in general, deciding if something is real or not should follow the rules of these categories.

There are ideas like “all,” “many,” and “one,” and the opposite of these is “none.” “None” means nothing — a concept that doesn’t connect to any real thing. For example, noumena (things as they are in themselves) don’t fit into what we can experience, so they’re like “nothing” in this sense. Some ideas, like new fundamental forces, can be thought about without contradicting ourselves, but since we have no experience of them, we shouldn’t count them as possible.

Reality means something exists. Negation means nothing — like when something is missing, such as a shadow or coldness. The way we sense things, like space and time, are just forms or shapes of how we see things, not real objects themselves. These forms are real in a way but aren’t actual things we can touch or see.

If a concept contradicts itself, it’s impossible and means nothing. For example, a shape that’s a straight line but has two sides can’t exist, so it’s “nothing.” This is how we divide the idea of nothing into different kinds.
