Some ideas are connected to what they describe before we even experience anything. Because of this, we can’t prove these ideas are true just by looking at the world after the fact. Instead, these ideas need to clearly explain the conditions that make objects match them. If they didn’t, the ideas would have no real meaning and would just be empty logical forms, not true concepts we understand.

This study of how our mind judges things has two parts. The first part looks at the way our senses help us use pure ideas in our mind, called the schematism of pure understanding. The second part talks about how we make new judgments based on these pure ideas, which then help us know other things before we experience them. This is about the basic rules of pure understanding.

The first chapter is about how pure ideas are connected to what we sense. When we group an object under an idea, what we think about the object must match the idea exactly.
