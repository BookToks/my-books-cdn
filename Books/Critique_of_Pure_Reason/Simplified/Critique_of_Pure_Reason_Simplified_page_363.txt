If there is no way to know something through our senses, then we can't really know any object at all. Just feeling or sensing something doesn’t mean we are thinking about an actual object. When I only focus on thinking, without using my senses, there is still a way my mind organizes ideas to understand objects in general. This means my thinking can go beyond just what I sense.

But thinking alone doesn’t mean I can know more objects. I can’t assume there are other ways to sense things besides what I already have, and we have no good reason to believe there are.

I call a concept "problematic" if it doesn’t have any contradictions but connects to ideas we can’t really understand or prove. For example, the idea of a "noumenon" means something that isn’t sensed but exists on its own, known only by pure thought. This idea isn’t contradictory because we can’t say that sensing is the only way to know things.

This idea is important because it stops us from thinking that our senses can explain everything. Things that our senses can’t reach are called noumena, meaning we can’t know everything about them just by sensing. However, we have no real way to understand if these noumena really exist. Our understanding goes beyond what we can sense, but without any way to actually sense or imagine these things, we can’t be certain about them.

So, the idea of noumena is just a limit to remind us that our senses don’t explain everything. It doesn’t give us positive knowledge about things beyond our senses, but it helps us avoid making wrong assumptions.

Kant divides objects into two groups: phenomena, which are things we can sense, and noumena, which are things beyond our senses.
