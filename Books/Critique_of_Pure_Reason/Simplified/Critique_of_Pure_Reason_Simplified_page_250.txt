Understanding how we connect ideas to things we experience starts with knowing that all our thoughts come from being aware of ourselves in every situation.

If we want to figure out how all our ideas come together to make sense, we have to start with something called pure self-awareness. Our experiences don’t mean much unless we can be aware of them. Being aware is the only way we can really know anything.

Before we even have any experience, we already know that all our thoughts are connected because they all belong to one consciousness – that’s us. This connection is what makes it possible for us to understand things as a whole. This idea is a basic rule about how our mind works.

The way all our thoughts fit together inside us is not just simple but involves combining many parts into one complete picture. This combination depends on a process called synthesis, which is how our mind puts different ideas together. If this process has to work every time, then the way we combine ideas must also always work.

It’s important to remember that all thoughts must relate to some kind of awareness. If we couldn’t be aware of a thought, it would be like it didn’t exist. All our experiences are linked to a bigger, original self-awareness that happens before any specific experience.

So, it’s necessary that all our awareness comes together as one – that of ourselves. This unity is the main rule that helps us think clearly and understand the world. Whether we are fully aware of this or not, the ability to think depends on this connection inside our mind.
