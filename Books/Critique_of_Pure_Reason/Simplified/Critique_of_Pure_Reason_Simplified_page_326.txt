When water rises above its usual level inside a glass, it’s not just a coincidence that this happens at the same time as you pour it in. As soon as you take water from a bigger container and put it into the glass, the water changes shape. It goes from being flat to curving inward inside the glass.

This cause-and-effect idea leads us to think about action, then force, and finally about something called substance. I won’t go into too much detail about these ideas here because my main focus is on where our basic knowledge comes from. Plus, many books already explain these ideas well. But I do want to talk about how we can recognize substance, especially because it shows itself better through action than just by how it looks.

Where there is action, or force, there is also substance. Substance is where all these changes and appearances come from. That sounds clear, but explaining exactly what substance means without getting stuck in confusing ideas is not easy. How can we say that the thing causing the action keeps going, which is a key part of what substance is?

From what we have said, this question isn’t so hard to answer, even though just thinking about the concepts alone might make it impossible. Action shows the connection between the cause and the effect. Since effects are changes that happen over time, there must be something that stays the same underneath all these changes. That “something” is substance.

According to the rule that every effect has a cause, actions cause all the changes we see. So, the thing causing these actions can’t be something that also changes, or else we would need another cause for that change, and so on. Because of this, action proves that substance exists without needing to first compare different experiences to find something that stays the same.

It’s clear that the main thing causing all changes can’t also be changing itself. This idea is very important and shows why substance must exist and last over time, at least in the world we experience.
