39 The argument from design was already criticized briefly in Hume’s published works, like the Enquiry concerning the Human Understanding (1748), section XI, and more deeply in Hume’s unpublished Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (written as early as 1751 but published only in 1779). Even though the Enquiry was translated into German by 1755, it didn’t seem to affect Kant much by 1762. The Dialogues weren’t known to Kant yet. When they were published and translated into German later, they influenced him a lot and are often mentioned, even if not directly quoted, in Kant’s Critique of Judgment.

45 You can find a translation of the Academy’s official summary of Mendelssohn’s essay in Walford, pp. 276-86. The full essay is in Moses Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 2 (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1931), pp. 267-330. Paul Guyer wrote a detailed comparison between Mendelssohn’s and Kant’s essays in "Mendelssohn and Kant: One Source of the Critical Philosophy," Philosophical Topics 19 (1991): 119-52.

51 Inquiry, 2:297; Walford, p. 271. Kant later changed his mind and said only moral qualities could definitely be said about God (A814/B842).

52 Inquiry, 2:298-300; Walford, pp. 272-45. For example, see Hobbes’s explanation of the difference in De Corpore, chapter 6, section 7.

54 Kant’s detailed talk about the difference between math and philosophy in the Critique is not just in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" but also in the "Doctrine of Method" (especially A712-81 B740-6). This should be compared carefully to, but not mixed up with, his earlier discussion in the Inquiry.
