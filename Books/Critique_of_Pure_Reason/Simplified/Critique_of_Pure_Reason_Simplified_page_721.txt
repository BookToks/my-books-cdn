 39 The argument from design was already criticized briefly in Hume's pub­ lished works, e.g., the Enquiry concerning the Human Understanding (1748), section XI, and was criticized extensively in Hume's as yet unpublished Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (originally drafted as early as 175 I, but not to be published until 1779)' But although the Enquiry had been trans­ lated into German as early as 1755, it does not seem to have had a major impact on Kant by 1762, and of course the Dialogues were not yet known to Kant at this point. When they were published and translated into German, they had a tremendous influence on him, and are constantly al­ luded to though not explicitly cited in the Critique of Judgment.

 45 A translation of the Academy's official abridgement of Mendelssohn's essay can be found in Walford, pp. 276-86. The full essay can be found in Moses Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, ed. Fritz Bamberger and Leo Strauss, vol. 2 (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1931), pp. 267-330. A detailed contrast between Mendelssohn's and Kant's essays can be found in Paul Guyer, "Mendelssohn and Kant: One Source of the Critical Philosophy," Philosophical Topics 19 (1991): II9-52.

 708 Notes to pages 34-38 54 Thus Kant's detailed discussion of the contrast between mathematics and philosophy in the Critique, which is found not just in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" but also in the "Doctrine of Method" (especially A7I2-381 B 740-6- 6), should be carefully compared to but not identified with his treatment of the distinction in the earlier Inquiry.
