Instead, Kant asks a totally different question: "Why do we connect what we call a representation in our mind to the actual object?" This question is tricky when it comes to pure ideas that we understand without using our senses. It’s not tricky when we think about ideas that come from real experiences, which happen because of things outside us, or about perfect ideas from God or our own intentions, where the idea comes first and causes us to think about the object.

But Kant now says that pure ideas, which come from inside us and that we know without experience, still have to apply to things we experience with our senses. Even though these ideas don’t come from the objects and don’t cause the objects, they still relate to them.

Kant admits he missed this question in his earlier work because he didn’t realize that our pure ideas and the way we sense things must both apply to the same objects we experience. So now he wants to explain how these pure ideas can match up exactly with experience, even though they don’t depend on experience. The old idea that these pure ideas tell us about things other than what we see or sense disappears.

Kant didn’t explain clearly how or why these pure ideas always fit with experience, but he thought he could organize these ideas, which he calls "categories," by following some basic rules of understanding. Even though this was confusing, he was sure he could finish his book, which he now called Critique of Pure Reason, in three months! But it actually took almost nine years because he didn’t yet understand why the categories must apply to what we experience.

As Kant kept thinking about this problem, he realized that time would be really important—not the question of whether time is real, but how we can clearly judge the order of events or experiences in time. This problem became his main focus in the years after his letter to Herz, especially in 1774-75, and stayed important in his Critique.

Kant wrote another letter to Herz near the end of 1773. He said he wouldn’t chase fame by copying others, and that he was still working on a rule that would solve this confusing problem and make the tricky parts of our understanding clearer and easier to use. He promised that his book, which he still called a critique of pure reason, would be ready by Easter or soon after—that means spring of 1774.
