 While I am saying this I believe I perceive in the face of the reader Axiv an indignation mixed with contempt at claims that are apparently so pretentious and immodest; and yet they are incomparably more mod­ erate than those of any author of the commonest program who pretends to prove the simple nature of the soul or the necessity of a first begin­ ning of the world. For such an author pledges himself to extend human cognition beyond all bounds of possible experience, of which I humbly admit that this wholly surpasses my capacity; instead I have to do merely with reason itself and its pure thinking; to gain exhaustive ac­ quaintance with them I need not seek far beyond myself, because it is in myself that I encounter them, and common logic already also gives me an example of how the simple acts of reason may be fully and systemat­ ically enumerated; only here the question is raised how much I may hope to settle with these simple acts if all the material and assistance of experience are taken away from me.
 
 So much for the completeness in reaching each of the ends, and for the comprehensiveness in reaching all of them together, which ends are not proposed arbitrarily, but are set up for us by the nature of cog­ nition itself, as the matter of our critical investigation.
 
 AXV Furthermore certainty and clarity, two things that concern the form of the investigation, are to be viewed as essential demands, which may rightly be made on the author who ventures upon so slippery an undertaking.
 
 As far as certainty is concerned, I have myself pronounced the judg­ ment that in this kind of inquiry it is in no way allowed to hold opin­ ions, and that anything that even looks like an hypothesis is a forbidden commodity, which should not be put up for sale even at the lowest price but must be confiscated as soon as it is discovered. For every cognition that is supposed to be certain a priori proclaims that it wants to be held for absolutely necessary, and even more is this true of a determination of all pure cognitions a priori, which is to be the standard and thus even the example of all apodictic (philosophical) certainty. Whether I have performed what I have just pledged in that respect remains wholly to the judgment of the reader, since it is appropriate for an author only to present the grounds, but not to judge about their effect on his judges.
 
 But in order that he should not inadvertently be the cause of weakenAxvi ing his own arguments, the author may be permitted to note himself those places that, even though they pertain only to the incidental end of the work, may be the occasion for some mistrust, in order that he may in a timely manner counteract the influence that even the reader's 102 Preface <A> slightest reservation on this point may have on his judgment over the chief end.
