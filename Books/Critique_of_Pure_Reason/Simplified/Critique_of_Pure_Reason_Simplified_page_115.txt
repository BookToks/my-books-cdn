While I say this, I think I see the reader feeling annoyed and a bit angry because my ideas might seem too bold and full of myself. But actually, my ideas are much more reasonable than those of many other writers who claim to prove things like the soul being simple or the world having a definite beginning. Those writers try to go beyond what we can actually experience, which is way beyond what I can do. I only work with reason and clear thinking, and to understand these, I don’t have to look far—they are inside me. Even basic logic shows how simple thinking steps can be listed clearly. The question is how much I can figure out using only reason, without relying on experience.

That’s about being complete in reaching each goal and covering all goals together. These goals aren’t chosen randomly but come from the nature of knowing itself, which is what I’m trying to investigate.

Also, being sure and clear are very important when doing this kind of tricky work. Anyone who tries this kind of thinking should be expected to be certain and clear.

About certainty, I have said that in this kind of study, you can’t just guess or assume things. Anything that looks like a guess must be rejected right away. For knowledge that is supposed to be certain without depending on experience, it must be absolutely necessary. This is even more true when you try to define all pure knowledge like this, which should be the model of complete certainty. Whether I have done this well is up to the reader to decide because it’s the reader’s job, not mine, to judge how well my reasons work.

Still, to avoid accidentally weakening my own arguments, I can point out parts that might make readers doubt me. This way, I can try to stop even small doubts from affecting how readers judge the main goal of my work.
