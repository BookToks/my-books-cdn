Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic

The idea of motion, which means something changing its place, only makes sense because we understand time. If we didn’t have an inborn sense of time, no idea could explain how something can change or have opposite conditions, like being in one place and not being there at the same time.

Only in time can we see opposite things happen one after the other. Our idea of time helps us understand how motion is possible, and this idea is very important.

a) Time isn’t something that exists on its own or sticks to things like a real feature. If it did, time would be real without anything real happening in it. Also, time can’t come before things as a way of organizing them and be known before experience. But time can be understood as the way our mind organizes what we experience inside ourselves. This means we can think about time before actually experiencing objects.

b) Time is just how we experience our inner feelings and ourselves. Time isn’t about the shape or position of things outside us. Instead, it’s about how our mind connects different thoughts and feelings inside. Because time doesn’t have a shape, we imagine it like a never-ending line, where moments follow each other one after the other. This shows that time is something we sense inside, even though we can explain it using outer things like a line.

c) Time is the basic way we experience all things happening. Space, on the other hand, is the way we experience things outside us, and it has limits.
