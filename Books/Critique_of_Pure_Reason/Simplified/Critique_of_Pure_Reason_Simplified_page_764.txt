3 There is an ambiguity in the definition of "practical logic" in Kant's para­ digm of a scholastic logic textbook, Georg Friedrich Meier's Auszug aus der Vernunftlehre (Halle, 1752), which foreshadows the complex agenda of the present "Doctrine of Method." Meier initially defines logica practica or "the practical doctrine of reason" as concerning the "particular ways in which the rules of learned cognition and learned presentation are applied" (§ 7, 17=72-3), which Kant is here arguing is not a part of logic proper but rather calls for philosophical reflection on the applicability of concepts of the un­ derstanding and reason. This is the initial concern of the "Doctrine of Method." Later, however, Meier writes that "A cognition is practical (cogni­ tio practica) insofar as it can move us in a noticeable way to do or omit an ac­ tion" (§ 216, 17=516). This suggests that "practical logic" has to do not with the application of theoretical concepts but rather with rules for action, or what Kant comes to call practical rather than theoretical reason; and Kant will also broach the foundations of his moral theory in the "Doctrine of Method," above all in the section entitled the "Canon of Pure Reason," thus suggesting that it is ultimately his moral philosophy and not merely his transcendental reflection which is the proper successor to the "practical logic" of the schools.

 5 The contrast between mathematical and philosophical method was one of Kant's oldest themes, and a major element in his campaign against previous forms of rationalism. For a major early statement, see the 1764 prize essay Inquiry concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morals (2:273-301). In this work, Kant argued that mathematics yields syn­ thetic propositions and philosophy analytic ones, a view which the "Tran­ scendental Aesthetic" of this Critique has revoked; but in the present section he retains another main claim of the earlier work, that mathematical proofs proceed by the construction of particular mathematical objects while philo­ sophical arguments are not constructive and determinate, but yield only more general principles and procedures for cognitive inquiry (see also the contrast between mathematical and philosophical analogies at A I 79801 B 222-3). For other statements of the contrast between mathematical and philosophical methods, see R 1634 (1752-56, 16:53-5); R 4445 (1772, 17=552-4); R 5583 (1778-80s, 18:241), R 5593 (1778-80s, 18:243-4), and R 5645 (1785-88? 1780-84? 18:287-95, at pp. 290-1).
 
 6 The proof Kant is describing is found in Euclid's Elements, book I, proposi­ tion 32.
 
 7 Kant is not here distinguishing between the concept of quantity and specific magnitudes, as he often does, but rather between the more determinate magnitudes of geometry (e.g., 180°) and the abstract magnitudes of algebra (e.g., 5X or x"').
