3 There is some confusion about what "practical logic" means in Kant’s time, especially in a logic textbook by Georg Friedrich Meier from 1752. At first, Meier says practical logic is about how we apply the rules of thinking and explaining things (§ 7, 17=72-3). Kant argues this isn’t really logic itself but more about thinking deeply on how we use ideas and reason. This idea is what Kant’s "Doctrine of Method" starts with.

Later, Meier says that a thought is practical if it moves us to actually do or not do something (§ 216, 17=516). This means practical logic isn’t just about theory but about rules for action, which Kant calls practical reason. Kant also talks about his moral ideas in the "Doctrine of Method," especially in the part called the "Canon of Pure Reason." This shows that Kant’s moral philosophy, not just his theory of knowledge, is the real follow-up to the old idea of practical logic.

4 For a general idea of what a "discipline" is, see R 5089 (1776-78, 18:80).

5 Kant often talked about the difference between math and philosophy methods. This was one of his main ideas, especially when criticizing old types of rational thinking. In an essay from 1764, he said math gives us synthetic truths, and philosophy gives analytic ones. But later, in this book, he changes this idea. Still, he keeps the point that math proofs work by building specific math objects, while philosophy gives general ideas and ways to think more deeply (see also the difference between math and philosophy examples at A I 79801 B 222-3). You can find more about this difference in other writings by Kant listed here.

6 The proof Kant talks about comes from Euclid’s Elements, book I, proposition 32.

7 Kant here isn’t separating the idea of quantity from specific sizes, like he usually does. Instead, he’s talking about clear sizes in geometry (like 180°) versus abstract sizes in algebra (like 5X or x²).

8 For Kant’s ideas about definitions, see the Jasche Logic, §§ 99-109 (Lectures on Logic, pp. 631-6), and similar parts in his other logic lectures, like Blomberg Logic (pp. 211-19), Vienna Logic (pp. 356-66), and Dohna-Wundlacken Logic (pp. 489-93).
