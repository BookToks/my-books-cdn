Cause and effect follow rules we can see and test. Because of this, they are part of the natural world, just like everything else. We notice cause and effect through the powers and abilities things show when they act.

In things without life or with only animal life, there’s no reason to think they have any abilities other than those based on what they can sense. But humans are different. We know the world through our senses, but we also know ourselves in a way that doesn’t come from sensing things. Some parts of us are like natural objects we can see and touch, but other parts, like certain abilities, can’t be explained just by sensing. These abilities are called understanding and reason. Reason is especially different because it works with ideas, not just things we can experience, and it uses these ideas to guide our thinking.

We know that reason can cause things to happen because we give ourselves rules to follow in what we do. When we say "you ought to do this," it means there is a kind of necessity behind it — a reason why we should act a certain way. This “ought” is special and doesn’t happen anywhere else in nature. Nature only shows us what does happen, not what should happen. For example, we can’t ask what a circle ought to be like; we can only ask what it actually is like.

The idea of "ought" means that an action is possible based on a concept or idea, not just on what we see happening in nature. Of course, the action has to be possible in real life, but the natural conditions only affect what actually happens, not the choice itself. This power to decide and cause things to happen is called the will. Philosophers sometimes study the will separately from other parts of how we understand the world.
