Chapter II, Section III

We have to admit that believing in God is more about faith than proof. When I try to understand the world, I don’t have any facts that absolutely require me to believe in God. I usually think about nature and how things happen naturally. But the idea that everything has a purpose is really important when I try to make sense of nature, and I can’t ignore it because I see many examples around me. I don’t know any other way to explain this order except by thinking that some super smart being planned everything wisely.

So, believing that a wise creator made the world helps me have a goal when I study nature. This belief isn’t certain, but it’s still useful. When I do experiments, they often support this idea, and no one has proven it wrong. That’s why I don’t just see it as an opinion—I actually strongly believe in God, at least in a theoretical way. But this belief is more about what I accept as true to guide my thinking, not about practical or everyday faith. This kind of belief comes from what some call “natural theology,” which is about finding evidence of God in nature.

Because of this same wisdom, and thinking about how amazing people are even though life is so short, I also have good reasons to believe that our souls live on after death.

Saying I believe in these things shows I’m humble about what I can really know, but at the same time, I’m confident in my belief. If I said I only accept these ideas as hypotheses—just guesses I’m allowed to make—I’d be pretending to know more about God and the world than I actually do. To call something a hypothesis, I need to know some of its qualities, not just that it exists. But belief is different—it’s about how an idea influences me and keeps me thinking in a certain way, even if I can’t fully explain it.

Belief like this can sometimes feel shaky when I think about hard questions or problems, and I might doubt it for a while. But usually, I come back to it.

Belief is very different when it comes to morals. There, I absolutely have to believe in something—that I must follow the moral law perfectly.
