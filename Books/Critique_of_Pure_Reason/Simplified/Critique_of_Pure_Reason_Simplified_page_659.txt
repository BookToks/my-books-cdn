Reason has its own purpose and goal, and we shouldn’t ignore that. Why does life show us so many things that are connected to what’s really important, yet seem so hard to fully understand or believe in? It’s like they tease us more than they satisfy us.

It’s not clear if we should try to give definite answers about these things, and it might even be risky. But it’s always good to let reason freely explore and examine ideas. Reason works best when it is allowed to set its own limits and expand its knowledge without being forced into conclusions that don’t fit its natural way.

So, when you argue with someone, use only clear and logical reasons, and respond with reason too. Don’t worry about practical concerns in a purely theoretical debate. Here, the argument just shows how reason can have opposing ideas that must be listened to and studied. This kind of debate helps reason grow and improves its judgment by setting boundaries.

The real issue isn’t the topic itself but how it’s talked about. You can still speak clearly and strongly about your beliefs, even if you can’t prove them completely.

If you asked the thoughtful David Hume why he questioned the comforting idea that reason can fully understand a highest being, he’d say he wanted to help reason understand itself better. He also didn’t like forcing reason to act strong while hiding its weaknesses that show up when it examines itself honestly.

On the other hand, if you asked Priestley, who believes only in what can be experienced and doesn’t like deep speculation, why he rejected ideas like soul freedom and immortality (he thinks hope for life after death is just expecting a miracle), he’d say it’s because reason loses power when some things aren’t explained by natural laws, which are the only things we can really know and define clearly.
