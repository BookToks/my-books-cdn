Lots of notes show how important this idea is. For example, check out R 4241 (1770s), R 4459 (1772), R 4461 (1772), R 4849 (1776-78), and R 5637 (1780-81). Also, there are notes from 1783-84 called "On moral theology" at R 6086-917.

About different ideas of freedom, see the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, section III, and notes R 4225-7 (1769-70), R 4548-50 (1772-75), and R 6076-7 (1785-88). The idea that transcendental freedom is impossible to fully understand comes from early notes like R 4334 and R 4338 (around 1770-75).

The details of the moral law will be talked about a lot in the Groundwork, section II, and the Critique of Practical Reason, sections 1-8. There are also some interesting notes at R 5445-6 (1776-78).

Kant discusses this more in later works, like the "Dialectic" part of the Critique of Practical Reason, the "Doctrine of Method" in the Critique of Judgment, and Religion within the Boundaries of Pure Reason. Also, see Kant’s notes from 1783-89 and the 1790s.

The word Reich usually means "kingdom," but "realm" or "empire" is a better way to show a group of people who govern themselves under a higher ruler without losing their freedom.

Kant talks about Leibniz’s essay On the Principles of Nature and Grace, based on Reason, written in 1714 and published after Leibniz died in 1718.

Compare this idea of a maxim with the one in the Groundwork. This new definition makes it clearer that a person can choose a law that is valid for everyone as their own personal rule, which fits Kant’s ethics.

See notes R 4996 (1776-78), R 5495 (1776-78), and R 6314 (1790-91) for more.

Kant’s argument against voluntarism has been part of his moral philosophy for a long time. He taught this in his ethics lectures. Voluntarism is the idea that moral laws are rules just because God wills them, not because they are reasonable. This idea was rejected during the Enlightenment in Germany and Britain by thinkers like Christian Wolff and Anthony Ashley Cooper, before John Toland published a version of Shaftesbury’s work in 1699.
