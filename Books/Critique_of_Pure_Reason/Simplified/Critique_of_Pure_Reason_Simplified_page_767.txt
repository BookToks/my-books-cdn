Numerous notes also reveal the important position of this claim: see, for example, R 4241 (177°-7I? 17:475-6), R 4459 (1772, 17:559-60), R 4461 (1772, ITS60-1), R 4849 (1776-78, 18:5-8, at p. 6), and R 5637 (1780-81, 18:268-78, especially p. 273). See also the series of notes from 1783-84 labeled by Kant "On moral theology" at R 6086-917 (18:445-60).
 
 27 On the different concepts of freedom, see Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, section III (4:446-8), and R 4225-7 (1769-70, 1]:444-6), R 454850 (1772-75, 17:589-90), and R 6076-7 (1785-88, 18:443). On the claim that transcendental freedom is necessarily incomprehensible, which is of quite early origin, see R 4334 (1770-7I? 1769? 1773-75? 17:508-9) and R 4338 (1770-71? 1769? 1773-75? ITSI0-II).
 
 28 Of course, the content of the moral law will be discussed at length in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, section II, and the Critique of Practical Reason, §§ 1-8. But see also the interesting notes at R 5445-6 (1776-78, 18:184).
 
 29 This will be discussed at length in Kant's subsequent works, including the "Dialectic" of the Critique of Practical Reason (5:107-141), the "Doctrine of Method" of the "Critique of Teleological Judgment" in the Critique of Judgment, §§ 83-4, 86-7, (5:429-36, 442-53), and Religion within the Boun­ daries of Pure Reason, preface (6:6-8n.). See also Kant's notes from 1783-89 at R 6108-9 (18:456-7), R 61 I 3 (18:459), R 6132-3 (18:464-5), and, from the 179os, R 6443 (19:718-19).
 
 30 Reich; usually translated as "kingdom," the translation by "realm" (or "em­ pire") better connotes the idea of a body of subjects who are themselves au­ tonomous under the leadership of a higher rules who does not undermine their autonomy.
 
 3 I Here Kant refers to Leibniz's essay On the Principles of Nature and Grace, based on Reason, written in 1714 and first published posthumously in the French journal L'Europe savante in 1718.
 
 32 Compare this definition of a maxim with that offered in the Groundwork, 4:420-Ill. The present definition makes it clearer than the Groundwork does that an agent can adopt an objectively valid law as his subjectively valid maxim, which any coherent interpretation of Kant's ethical theory requires.
 
 33 See R 4996 (1776-78, 18:55), R 5495 (1776-78, 18:198-9), and R 6314 (1790-91, 18:616-17).
 
 34 The anti-voluntarist argument expressed here was long a part of Kant's moral philosophy, and central to the conception of morality that he con­ veyed to his students in his lectures on ethics; see, for instance, Moralphilo­ sophie Collins, 2]:274-9; in Immanuel Kant, Lectures on Ethics, edited by Peter Heath and J. B. Schneewind (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), pp. 65-69. The rejection of voluntarism, that is, the view that moral laws are such simply because they are willed by God rather than be­ cause of their inherent rationality, was a centerpiece of the Enlightenment in both Germany (where it was advanced by Christian Wolff) and Britain, where it was argued by Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury, prior to 1699, when John Toland published a pirated edition of Shaftes754 Notes to pages 684-698 bury's An Inquiry Concerning Virtue, or Merit; see book I, part III, section II (in the edition by David Walford [Manchester: Manchester University Press, lin I], p.
