The principle of contradiction says that something cannot be both true and false at the same time. It cancels out any idea that contradicts itself.

But this idea can also help us learn the truth, not just spot mistakes. If a statement is about the meaning of words (analytic), whether it says yes or no, we can always check if it’s true by using this principle. If the opposite of what we think about something is wrong, then what we believe must be right because its opposite would not make sense.

So, this principle is very important for understanding things based on how we define them. But it doesn’t help us with all kinds of knowledge. It’s a must-have rule, but it doesn’t prove that what we know is true in every case. When we deal with more complex knowledge (synthetic), we still need to avoid contradictions, but this principle alone can’t tell us if it’s true or not.

There is another version of this principle that says, “It is impossible for something to be and not be at the same time.” This statement includes the idea that it can’t happen at once, but it also talks about time, saying that something can’t be two opposite things at the exact same moment.

For example, a person can’t be young and old at the same time, but they can be young at one time and old at another time. The principle is about logic, so it shouldn’t be mixed up with time like this. The confusion happens because we take one part of a thing and wrongly combine it with its opposite. This only causes a problem when we mix those parts in a certain way, not with the whole thing itself.
