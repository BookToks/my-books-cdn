There are two ways to think about how things are connected: one is about parts fitting together to make a whole, and the other is about causes that explain why something exists.

The first way is like putting puzzle pieces together. Each piece belongs to the puzzle, so they are all part of the same thing and are just appearances. The second way is about tracing back causes to find a reason why something exists at all. In this case, the cause might not be just another piece in the same puzzle.

So, there’s a problem that seems like a contradiction. But the solution is that both ideas can be true in different ways. Everything we see and experience depends on something else, so it’s always changing and not absolutely necessary. But there could also be one thing that exists without depending on anything else — something that is always necessary.

This necessary thing wouldn’t be part of what we experience and wouldn’t make anything in our world absolutely necessary. It would be completely separate from everything we know through our senses. This is different from the idea of freedom, where the cause is still part of the world we experience but its power is understood differently.

The important rule here is that everything we experience has some cause or condition we can find, and nothing in our experience is totally independent or self-sufficient. We always look for causes within what we can observe. But this doesn’t mean there can’t be something beyond what we experience that explains everything else.
