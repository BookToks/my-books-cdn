Most students, and especially those who only focus on school and stay students their whole lives, don’t think beyond what they learn in class. It’s strange, though, that even if someone learns math in any way, it still counts as real thinking. But this doesn’t happen the same way with philosophy.

This is because teachers can only teach from the basic, true rules of reason. These rules can’t be made up or argued against by students, because reason here works in a clear and pure way that can’t be wrong or tricked. Out of all the subjects that rely on pure reason, only math can actually be learned for sure. Philosophy, on the other hand, can’t really be learned fully; at best, you can learn how to think philosophically.

Philosophy is the whole system of all philosophical knowledge. You have to see it as a perfect example to judge all the different ways people try to do philosophy. Philosophy is more like an idea of a perfect science that we don’t have yet. People try to get closer to it, but it’s hard because feelings often get in the way. We only have imperfect versions of it so far. Until we find the true philosophy, no one can say they have fully learned it. Instead, we can only learn how to philosophize — that means using reason to explore ideas and question the rules themselves.

So far, philosophy has mostly been seen as a way to organize knowledge logically, like a system. But there’s also a bigger idea of philosophy, one that sees it as the study of how all human thinking connects to our important goals. In this view, the philosopher isn’t just someone who makes reason work nicely, but someone who sets the rules for how human reason should be used.
