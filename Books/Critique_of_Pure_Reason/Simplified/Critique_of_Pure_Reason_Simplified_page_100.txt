This part talks about how our mind understands things and if we can know some things without experience. 

The second section explains the basic ideas our mind uses to understand the world.

Book Two is about the rules our mind follows to think clearly.

It starts by talking about how our judgment works in general.

Chapter One explains how our mind connects ideas to real things.

Chapter Two lists all the important rules for understanding.

The first part talks about the main rule for clear and simple judgments.

The second part explains the main rule for judgments that add new information.

The third part shows all the rules for understanding new ideas step by step.

1. The first rule is about how we see things.

2. The second rule is about how we expect to feel things.

3. The third rule is about how we experience time and cause and effect.

A. The first analogy says things keep existing.

B. The second analogy says events happen in order because one causes another.

C. The third analogy says things can happen at the same time and affect each other.

4. The last rules are about how we think about real experiences.

There is also a part added later that argues against the idea that only our mind is real.

Another added note talks about all these rules as a system.

Chapter Three explains why we divide everything into things we can experience and things we canâ€™t.

There is an appendix about confusing ideas when we think too much.

Finally, there is a second big part called the transcendental dialectic.

It starts with an introduction and talks about how our mind can trick us.

Then the content continues.
