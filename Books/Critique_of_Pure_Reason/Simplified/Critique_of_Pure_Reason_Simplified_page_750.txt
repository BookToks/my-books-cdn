Between 1780 and 1781, there were more thoughts shared about Plato. For more on this, see references R 6050, R 6051, and R 6055, which discuss "philosophical enthusiasm."

Plato’s idea of recollection, or anamnesis, is explained in his works Meno, Phaedo, and Phaedrus. There is also a mention of it in the Republic, where it talks about the soul looking toward perfect forms.

Johann Jakob Brucker, who lived from 1696 to 1770, wrote a book called Historia critica philosophica. The part about Plato is in volume I, pages 627-728. He didn’t think Plato’s ideas worked well in politics, and he says this on page 726.

Plato never said that punishment wouldn’t be needed in a perfect society. Actually, he believed punishment helps teach people to be more just, as shown in the Republic and the Gorgias.

Plato also believed that forms or ideas cause natural things to exist. You can find this in Phaedo, Republic, and Timaeus.

There are several writings that talk about different types of representation, including R 1705, R 2834-6, R 2835, R 2836, and R 4073.

You can compare these ideas with R 5093. The foundation for ideas of reason based on relations is explained clearly in R 5555.

The argument mentioned earlier, which is different because it divides the "Dialectic" into three parts based on types of objects instead of relations, is found in R 5553. In R 5642, Kant uses this new idea and connects it to three forms of reasoning: categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive.

Baumgarten explained the Wolffian system of metaphysics in his 1738 book Metaphysica. It is split into a general science called "ontology," followed by three special sciences: "cosmology," "psychology," and "natural theology."

Kant defines a paralogism as a wrong conclusion that looks correct because the premises are true but the form is false. This is explained in R 5552.

Kant talks about traditional rational psychology in several places, including R 4230, Metaphysik L, and Metaphysik Mrongovius, where he criticizes it. He also discusses it as part of the antinomies in R 4758-9 and gives more details in R 5451-61.
