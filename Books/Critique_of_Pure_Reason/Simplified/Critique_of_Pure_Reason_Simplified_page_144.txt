When we make judgments based on experience, it's not hard to understand how they work.  

Here, X is the full experience of the object, and I think about it using a concept A, which is only part of that experience. For example, even though I don’t include the idea of weight in my general concept of a body, the concept still points to the full experience. Because of this, I can add other parts of the experience, like weight, to the concept later.  

First, I understand the concept of a body by its features like size, shape, and hardness. But then, looking back at my experience, I notice that weight is always connected to those features.  

So, experience (X) is what lies outside the concept (A) and makes it possible to add new things, like weight, to the concept.  

But for synthetic a priori judgments, this help from experience is missing. If I want to add something new (B) to a concept (A), what do I rely on to do this, since I can’t just check in experience?  

Take the statement: "Everything that happens has a cause." When I think about something happening, I imagine it existing after some time, and I can make some judgments based on that. But the idea of a cause is different and not included in the idea of something happening.  

So how do I come to say something new about what happens and understand that cause belongs to it, even though it’s not part of the original idea?  

What is the thing (X) that helps my understanding add this new idea (cause) to the original concept (something that happens)?
