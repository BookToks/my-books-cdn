When we accept changes to the text, we only use sources from Benno Erdmann’s edition of the Critique in the Akademie edition (1911), which we call "Erdmann." This means we don’t include changes from older editors in the 1800s, like those in Raymund Schmidt’s edition (1926, 1930), which Norman Kemp Smith used for his English translation (1929, 1933). Also, when Kant’s use of the phrase "a priori" is unclear—whether it changes a verb or a noun—we try to keep it unclear, because he always treats it as a Latin phrase, not a German word.

The biggest problem we had was how to show the differences between the first (1781 or "A") and second (1787 or "B") editions of the Critique. We decided to handle this differently than Erdmann, Schmidt, or Kemp Smith. Erdmann treated A and B as two separate books. He put B in Volume 3 of the Akademie edition and A in Volume 4, but only up to the part where Kant stopped making changes. This made it hard to compare parts of A and B. Schmidt and Kemp Smith saw B as the main text and put the changes from A in notes, except when Kant rewrote whole chapters. Then, they showed A’s version first and B’s version after.

This way of doing things made it confusing to read and hard to understand how the first edition really looked. To fix this, we show both versions of the parts Kant rewrote a lot and completely. So, we give two versions of the introduction, the "Transcendental Aesthetic," the chapter on "Distinction between Phenomena and Noumena," and two versions of the preface, "Transcendental Deduction," and "Paralogisms." To help readers compare the editions better than Erdmann did, we also list the page numbers from both editions for all parts Kant kept mostly the same, even in chapters he rewrote a lot but not completely. We show Kant’s changes in footnotes. When Kant made only small changes, we follow Schmidt and Kemp Smith by using B’s text as the main one and putting differences from A in footnotes. Any new parts added in B are shown inside angled brackets.
