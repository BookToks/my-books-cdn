Part of being aware that we exist is knowing that we exist in time, which is called inner experience. When we think "I am," we know there is a subject or self, but this doesn’t mean we have real knowledge or experience of ourselves yet. Real experience needs more than just the idea that something exists; it also needs intuition, like a sense of time inside us. To understand this inner experience, we actually need outer objects, meaning things outside ourselves. So, inner experience depends on outer experience.

When we think about time in our experiences, this fits perfectly. We can only notice changes in time by seeing how things move outside us, like the sun moving in the sky compared to the Earth. We don’t have anything inside us that stays the same all the time except matter, and even this idea of something lasting is assumed before experience happens. This also means that our sense of time inside depends on the existence of things outside us.

When we think about ourselves by saying "I," this is not something we sense or see directly. It’s just a mental idea about ourselves as thinking beings. This "I" doesn’t have any qualities, like being solid, that could help us understand time inside ourselves like how matter helps us understand time outside.

The fact that we need outer objects to be aware of ourselves doesn’t mean that every time we imagine something outside, it is actually there. Sometimes, we just imagine things, like in dreams or when we’re confused, and these ideas come from memories of things we really saw before. The main point is that inner experience only happens because outer experience happens first. Even imagining outside things depends on the real ability to sense the outside world.
