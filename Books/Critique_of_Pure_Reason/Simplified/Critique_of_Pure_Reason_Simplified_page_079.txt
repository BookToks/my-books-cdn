Ten days later, he wrote to Herz with these words: My work, whether it succeeds or fails, will definitely change the way people think about this part of knowledge called metaphysics, which is very important to us. I didn’t try to trick anyone or use fake arguments to fix my ideas. Instead, I took many years to reach a clear understanding that I’m fully happy with now. I don’t want to change the main idea at all, though I might add some small details or explanations here and there.

For Kant, the Critique of Pure Reason was just the first step before writing about the nature of the world and morals, which he had planned for a long time. After finishing the Critique, he started working on these two parts. He made good progress, publishing the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science in 1786, where he showed how his ideas apply to motion and Newton’s physics. He also wrote the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals in 1785, which was supposed to introduce a detailed system of moral duties that he didn’t finish until 1797.

At first, people didn’t respond to the Critique of Pure Reason the way Kant expected. He hoped it would change how everyone thought, but it didn’t. So, during the 1780s, he spent a lot of time explaining and clearing up the ideas in his philosophy that he thought were finished in 1781. This included writing a short defense to make the Critique easier to understand in 1783 called the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics; working on some important parts in his private notes during 1783-84; rewriting parts in the introduction to his 1786 book on natural science; making big changes to the Critique of Pure Reason for its second edition in 1787; and finally, writing two more critiques, the Critique of Practical Reason in 1788 and the Critique of Judgment in 1790. These last two books weren’t planned when he first published the Critique of Pure Reason but came out of his ongoing work to make his philosophy clearer.
