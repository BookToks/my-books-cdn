The transcendental table of categories does not miss anything by leaving out the ideas of unity, truth, and perfection. These ideas are not part of the table because they donâ€™t relate directly to objects.

Instead, we think about these ideas only by using basic logical rules that check if our thoughts make sense with each other.

This is about how our understanding works, and it helps explain the pure concepts we use when we think about things.

The next part talks about how we prove these pure concepts are real and important for understanding.
