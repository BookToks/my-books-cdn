At the most important rule for all clear judgments, related to categories, the ideas about space and time say that these are what make it possible for us to experience things as they appear. But these ideas don’t apply to things as they really are on their own. This part isn’t what we are focusing on here. Also, math ideas don’t belong in this system because they come from what we see and feel, not from pure thinking. Still, math is important because it shows how certain kinds of knowledge can be possible even before we experience anything.

We also need to talk about the rule for clear judgments, which is different from the rule for judgments that add new information. Understanding this difference helps us avoid confusion and shows us exactly what makes those new kinds of judgments special.

The system of pure understanding starts with the most important rule for clear judgments. No matter what we think about or how it relates to things, all our judgments must not contradict themselves. If they do, those judgments mean nothing, even without checking the real world. But even if a judgment doesn’t contradict itself, it can still connect ideas in a way that isn’t really supported by the facts or any good reason, so it might be wrong or baseless.

The idea that nothing can have a description that goes against it is called the principle of contradiction. This is a general but negative rule for all truth. It only belongs to logic because it applies to thoughts themselves, not to the things they are about.
