The two answers about how big the world is in space are the same problem. If the world is infinite and has no edges, it’s way too big for us to understand or experience. But if it’s finite and has edges, you can still ask: What decides where those edges are? Empty space isn’t a thing by itself, and you can’t stop at it or use it as part of something you can experience. (Who can really experience absolute emptiness?) So, a world with edges is too small for what you’re trying to understand.

Second, if everything in space (matter) is made of endless parts, then breaking it down never stops and becomes too much for your brain to handle. But if space stops breaking down at some smallest part, that part still suggests there could be even smaller parts, so it’s too small for the idea of something that never ends.

Third, if you think that everything that happens is just a chain of events following natural laws, then every cause is itself caused by something else. This means you keep going back forever, looking for what caused what, and this endless chain is too big for you to fully get.

If you sometimes believe that some things happen by themselves because of freedom, then you’ll still ask “Why?” and want to find a cause. But because of natural laws, you’ll be forced to look past that, and this total connection will be too small for your idea of how things must connect.

Fourth, if you believe there is something absolutely necessary (like the world itself, something inside it, or its cause), then this thing must exist at a time way, way earlier than any time you can point to. Otherwise, it would depend on something else. But then this necessary thing is too far away and too big for you to experience or ever find by looking back in time.

But if you think everything in the world…
