Sometimes we think about causes and effects in a way that doesn’t really make sense. For example, causes outside of us relate to what we see and hear, but the effects happen inside us as thoughts. These two kinds of senses—outer and inner—are connected but very different.

Outside of us, changes only happen when things move or change places. Causes there only create effects related to space and movement. But inside us, effects are thoughts, and these don’t have anything to do with space or motion. So, it’s hard to understand how causes outside can lead to effects inside.

We should remember that what we call “bodies” aren’t really things we can know for sure—they’re just appearances, or how things seem to us. Motion isn’t caused by some unknown thing moving; it’s just how our senses experience changes. So, both bodies and motion aren’t really outside us—they exist only as experiences inside us. The real problem is figuring out how these experiences fit together so that we see outer things following natural laws. This question is different from wrongly thinking there’s some unknown cause outside us making our thoughts happen, which only causes confusion.

When we’re used to thinking in a certain way for a long time, it’s hard to change that thinking quickly and clearly. Because of this, it’s tough to fully free our reason from tricky, misleading ideas.

I think I can explain this better.

There are three kinds of objections people make: dogmatic, critical, and skeptical. A dogmatic objection argues directly against an idea by claiming to know more about the thing being discussed. It’s basically saying, “I know more about this than you do.” A critical objection doesn’t attack the idea itself but challenges the proof or evidence for it. It leaves the idea alone and only questions the reasons given for it.
