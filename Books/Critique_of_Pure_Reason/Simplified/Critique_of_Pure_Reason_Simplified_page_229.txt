A whole thing (like a big idea) can be split into parts (smaller ideas). These parts don't go under each other but stand side by side. This means they don’t control each other in a chain but work together as a group. If you pick one part, the others can’t be true at the same time, and vice versa.

Now, think about a group of things that exist together. One thing isn’t just the cause of another like a chain reaction. Instead, they all work together at the same time, affecting each other. For example, parts of a body pull and push each other. This is different from one thing causing another without getting affected back. When we understand ideas, we use the same way of thinking: parts exclude each other but still belong to the same whole.

There’s also an old idea in philosophy that talks about pure concepts our mind uses. These ideas are not part of the main categories but still seem important for understanding objects. The famous saying from the scholars is: “Every being is one, true, and good.” Although this idea hasn’t helped much in making new conclusions and is mostly seen as obvious or repetitive, it has been around for a long time. Because it has lasted so long, it’s worth looking into where it comes from and why people keep believing it.
