To be sure, logically one can express negatively any propositions that one wants, but in regard to the content of our cognition in general, that is, whether it is expanded or limited by a judgment, negative judgments have the special job solely of preventing error. Hence even negative propositions, which are to prevent a false cognition, are often quite true yet empty where error is never possible, i.e., not appropriate for their purpose, and for this reason are often ridiculous, like the proposition of the scholastic orator that Alexander could not have conquered any lands without an army.
 
 But where the limits of our possible cognition are very narrow, where the temptation to judge is great, where the illusion that presents itself is very deceptive, and where the disadvantage of error is very serious, there the negative in instruction, which serves merely to defend us from errors, is more important than many a positive teaching by means of which our cognition could be augmented. The compulsion through which the constant propensity to stray from certain rules is limited and finally eradicated is called discipline. It is different from culture, which would merely produce a skill without first canceling out another one that is already present. In the formation of a talent, therefore, A7IO/B738 which already has by itself a tendency to expression, discipline will make a negative contribution,* but culture and doctrine a positive one.
 
 * I am well aware that in the language of the schools the name of discipline is customarily used as equivalent to that of instruction." But there are so many Unterweisung d 628 The discipline of pure reason Everyone will readily grant that the temperament as well as the tal­ ents that would allow a free and unlimited movement (such as imagina­ tion and wit) require discipline in many respects.
