You can always say something in a negative way if you want, but when it comes to what we know, negative judgments mainly help us avoid mistakes. Sometimes, negative statements are true but don’t really add anything new because there’s no chance of being wrong. For example, saying "Alexander couldn’t have conquered any land without an army" sounds silly because it’s obvious and doesn’t help us understand more.

When what we can know is very limited, and it’s easy to make wrong guesses because things seem tricky, negative instructions that stop us from making mistakes are more important than positive ones that add new knowledge. The way we stop ourselves from breaking important rules over and over is called discipline. Discipline is different from culture, which helps you learn a skill but doesn’t get rid of old habits.

So, when someone already has a natural talent or skill, discipline helps by stopping bad habits, while culture and teaching help by adding good skills. Everyone agrees that people with creative talents, like imagination and quick thinking, need discipline in many ways to control themselves.
