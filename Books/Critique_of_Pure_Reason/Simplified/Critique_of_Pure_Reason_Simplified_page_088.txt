We want to help readers clearly see the differences between the two editions without acting like they are totally separate works, which Erdmann’s way does.

We believe it’s important not to force our own ideas about the Critique on readers. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t point them to helpful materials for understanding the text. So, we included two kinds of references to help with this.

The first kind is Kant’s own notes in his copy of the first edition of the Critique. These notes were published by Benno Erdmann in 1881. They include things like crossing out words, changing phrases, or writing longer comments. Schmidt and Kemp Smith only pointed out where Kant changed a few words, but left out most of the notes. We included everything Erdmann found in our footnotes, matching where the notes appear as closely as possible. This way, readers can not only read Kant’s original first edition but also see how Kant himself marked it. (No annotated second edition has ever been found.) We cite these notes with "E" for Erdmann, followed by numbers showing where they appear in Erdmann’s and the Akademie editions. 

The second kind of reference comes from many of Kant’s notes found in the "hand-written remains," which are in volumes 14 to 23 of the Akademie edition.

We couldn’t list all these notes but tried to include those that help explain specific parts of the Critique, especially early drafts or later rewrites. Since these notes aren’t in the original editions or Kant’s own copy, we don’t mention them in our main footnotes but put references to them in the endnotes.

Our translation wasn’t made from just one German edition. Like most scholars today, we started with Raymund Schmidt’s edition in the Philosophische Bibliothek. But as we worked, we saw that Schmidt’s edition is the least strict among twentieth-century editions. It updates spelling and punctuation a lot and accepts many editorial changes. So, we checked our translation against three other important editions: Erdmann’s in the Akademie edition, Wilhelm Weischedel’s edition, and Ingeborg Heidemann’s edition.
