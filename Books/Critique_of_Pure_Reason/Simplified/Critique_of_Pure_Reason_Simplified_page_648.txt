A transcendental proposition is a type of knowledge that combines ideas in a logical way. It helps us understand how we can connect different pieces of information from experience, but it doesn't give us any direct, obvious sensory information on its own.

There are two main ways we use reason, even though both are based on universal knowledge that we can have before experience. These two ways are different because things we experience come to us in two parts: the form of intuition (which means space and time), and the matter (which is the physical stuff we sense).

The form of intuition, space and time, can be understood completely before we have any experience. The matter, or physical content, is something we only know through experience, and it always involves our senses.

For the physical part, we can't have exact knowledge before experience, only general ideas about how sensations might come together. But for space and time, we can create exact ideas beforehand because we shape objects ourselves in these forms.

The first way we use reason is by applying concepts to what we see, based on the real content we experience. We can only know this content after experiencing it.

The second way is by building concepts because these ideas fit perfectly with the forms of space and time. This lets us understand things clearly without needing any experience.

When we try to figure out if something exists in space or time, or how it relates to other things like cause and effect, we use concepts to think about it. But we can't create these ideas just by imagining them; they depend on how our senses connect information.

For example, the idea of cause goes beyond just seeing something happen. It refers to the general time conditions that match the idea of cause in our experience. So, we use concepts as guides to link what we sense, but we can't build these concepts from scratch without relying on experience.
