A transcendental proposition is therefore a synthetic ratioÂ­ nal cognition in accordance with mere concepts, and thus discursive, since through it all synthetic unity of empirical cognition first becomes possible, but no intuition is given by it a priori.
 
 There are thus two uses of reason, which, regardless of the univer- A 72 3 / B 75] sality of cognition and its a priori generation, which they have in common, are nevertheless very different in procedure, precisely because there are two components to the appearance through which all objects are given to us: the form of intuition (space and time), which can be cognized and determined completely a priori, and the matter (the physical), or the content, which signifies a something that is encountered in space and time, and which thus contains an existence and corresponds to sensation. With regard to the latter, which can never be given in a determinate manner except empirically, we can have nothing a priori except indeterminate concepts of the synthesis of possible sensations insofar as they belong to the unity of apperception (in a possible experience). With regard to the former we can determine our concepts a priori in intuition, for we create the objects themselves in space and time through homogeneouso synthesis, considering them merely as quanta. The former is called the use of reason in accordance with concepts, because we can do nothing further than bring appearances under concepts, according to their real content, which cannot be determined except empirically, i.e., a posteriori (though in accord with those concepts as rules of an empirical synthesis); the latter is the use of reason through construction of concepts, because these concepts, since they al- A 724/B752 ready apply to an a priori intuition, for that very reason can be determinately given in pure intuition a priori and without any empirical data. To decide about everything that exists (a thing in space or time) whether and how far it is or is not a quantum, whether existence or the lack thereof must be represented in it, how far this something (which fills space or time) is a primary substratum or mere determination, whether it has a relation of its existence to something else as cause or effect, and * By means of the concept of cause I actually go beyond the empirical concept A 72 2 / B 750 of an occurrence (that something happens), but not to the intuition that exhibits the concept of cause in concreto, rather to the time-conditions in general that may be found to be in accord with the concept of cause in experience. I therefore proceed merely in accordance with concepts, and cannot proceed through construction of concepts, since the concept is a rule of the synthesis of perceptions, which are not pure intuitions and which therefore cannot be given priori.
