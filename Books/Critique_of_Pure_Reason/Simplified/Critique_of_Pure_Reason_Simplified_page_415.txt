Part II, Division II, Book I talks about how reason tries to find something totally unconditioned or absolute.

We can say that reason’s unity in what we see is like the unity of understanding that categories express. Reason only works with understanding, but not because understanding gives us the full picture of experience—since no experience is completely unconditioned. Instead, reason helps guide understanding toward a unity it can’t fully grasp, trying to combine all understanding’s actions about any object into one whole.

So, pure reason’s ideas go beyond experience, while pure understanding’s ideas stay within what we can experience.

A necessary concept of reason is one that we can’t find an exact example of through our senses. The pure concepts of reason we talked about are called transcendental ideas.

They are ideas of pure reason because they think about all knowledge from experience as connected by an absolute totality of conditions.

These ideas aren’t made up randomly; they come from how reason works and relate necessarily to all understanding. They go beyond experience, and no real object matches them exactly.

When we call something an idea, we say a lot about its object (as understood by pure thinking), but not much about how it actually happens in real life, because as a maximum concept, nothing exactly fitting it can be found in reality.

Since in pure thinking, reason aims for a concept that can never be fully reached, having such a concept is like not having it at all, so it’s called only an idea.

For example, the absolute whole of appearances is only an idea because we can never fully picture it; it stays a problem without a solution.

On the other hand, when reason is used practically, it’s about following rules and can always be partly applied in real life. Although this practical use is limited and imperfect, it is always influenced by the idea of complete perfection.

So, the practical idea is something given or set as a goal.
