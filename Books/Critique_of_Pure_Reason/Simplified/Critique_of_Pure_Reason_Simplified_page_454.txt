When I say "I think," the "I" is the main subject, like a simple thing or substance. But these ideas would only make sense if they were based on experience. Since there isn’t a universal rule that explains how thinking works in general without experience, these ideas don’t really have real meaning because they aren’t based on anything we can actually observe. So, even though my first idea about what it means to be a thinking being seems believable, it starts to look suspicious, but I still haven’t found a clear mistake yet.

If I look deeper into where these qualities I give myself as a thinking being come from, I find a mistake. These qualities are just pure ideas or categories. I don’t think about a real object, but only about how different thoughts connect to create an idea of an object. Without something real to base it on, these categories alone can’t help me understand an object. Only when I have a real experience or image of something can I think about it using these categories. For example, if I say something is a substance in how it appears, I need to have some real sense of it first, so I can tell what is the thing itself and what depends on it. If I say something looks simple, I mean its appearance can’t be divided more. But if I only think of something as simple in my mind and not from real experience, then I don’t really know anything about it, just my own idea. I say it’s simple only because I don’t know anything else about it.

When I think just about myself ("I"), I can say I am a substance and simple in my mind, and these ideas about the mind are correct. But this doesn’t really tell me anything about the soul I want to understand. These ideas don’t apply to real experiences, so they don’t help me learn anything about the soul. The idea of substance doesn’t tell me if the soul lasts by itself, or if it’s part of the outside world that can change or disappear. These are important things if I want to understand the soul’s origin or what happens to it later. So, if I just say "The soul is a simple substance" using only my ideas, it’s clear that this idea doesn’t actually teach me anything real about the soul.
