Using a method like this over and over would create a system based only on pure reason. But that takes a lot, and it’s still unclear if we can actually improve our thinking that much or when it would be possible. So, we can think of a study that just looks at pure reason—where it comes from and what its limits are—as a kind of introduction to a system of pure reason.

This study wouldn’t be a set of rules to follow, but more like a check-up on pure reason. Its job would be mainly to clean up our thinking and keep it from making mistakes, which is already a big help. I call all knowledge “transcendental” when it’s about our basic ideas of things, not the things themselves.

A system of these ideas would be called transcendental philosophy. But that’s too much to start with. Since this study would have to include both breaking down and building up knowledge from the basics, it’s too broad for what we want. We only need to analyze just enough to understand how basic ideas come together, which is our main goal.

This investigation, which I call a transcendental critique, isn’t about making new knowledge but about fixing what we already have and testing if it’s good or not. That’s what we’re focusing on now. This critique is like a preparation for a full system or, if that’s not possible, at least a guide that could someday show the whole philosophy of pure reason, either by adding to it or by setting limits on what we can know.

We can hope this is possible because our goal isn’t to understand everything in the world, which is endless, but only how our mind understands the world. And we only focus on the knowledge we have before any experience, which we don’t have to find outside ourselves. This kind of knowledge is probably small enough that we can fully list it, judge how good it is, and properly understand it.
