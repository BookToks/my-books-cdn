Every big idea about how we know things comes from just one main concept. It shows the special rule that makes the object possible based on that idea. There can only be one real reason for proving something because outside that idea, there’s nothing else that can define the object. So, the proof only explains the object based on that one concept, which is unique.

For example, when we said “Everything that happens has a cause,” we meant that this rule comes from the only way to understand things happening in time. Without this rule, we couldn’t say that anything really happens or is part of our experience. This is the only way to prove it because only by using the law of cause and effect does what we see have real meaning and truth. Some have tried to prove it using other ideas like chance, but if you think about it, chance just means something happens after it didn’t exist before, so you end up back at the same rule.

If you want to prove “Everything that thinks is simple,” you don’t focus on many thoughts but only on the idea of the “I,” which is simple and connected to all thinking. It’s the same with proving God exists: the proof depends only on the connection between the idea of the most real being and a necessary being, and you can’t find the proof anywhere else.

Because of this, the criticism of what reason can do is less harsh. If reason works only with ideas, then only one proof is possible if any proof is possible at all. So, if someone gives ten proofs, you can be sure none really work. If one proof was really strong, why would they need more? Usually, it’s like a lawyer using lots of arguments to confuse people who don’t want to think deeply and just pick the first argument they hear.

The third important rule for pure reason’s proofs is that they should never be indirect but always direct. A direct proof is one that makes you believe something is true because you clearly understand why it’s true. An indirect proof can make you sure about something but never helps you fully understand why it’s true.
