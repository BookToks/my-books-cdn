A system that organizes all the basic ideas we use to understand things is made through reasoning, even though it deals with ideas alone. It basically asks if all the things we see belong together in one single experience, where each thing we notice fits perfectly and can’t be mixed with other experiences. Or, it asks if what I notice could be part of more than one possible experience.

Our mind gives rules to experience based on how we sense and think about things. These rules make it possible to understand the world. Even if other ways to sense or think existed, we couldn’t understand or imagine them because space, time, and logical thinking are the only ways we know. And even if other ways did exist, they wouldn’t be part of the experiences we can have, which is how we come to know objects.

Whether there are other kinds of experiences or things beyond what we can possibly experience can’t be decided by the mind, which only works by putting together what we are actually given.

Normally, when we think about what’s possible, we realize that what actually happens is just a small part of all the possibilities. Saying "everything that happens is possible" also means "some possibilities don’t happen." It seems like there are more possibilities than actual things because something extra would have to be added to make a possibility real.

But I don’t agree that anything extra is added to what’s possible. What would be added to possibility would actually be impossible. The only thing added to what I understand is something that fits with what I can experience. And anything that fits with experience, even if I don’t see it right now, is real.

Still, the idea that there could be another whole set of connected experiences beyond what I see can’t be proven from what I know, and it’s even less believable if I know nothing at all. Without something to think about, nothing can be imagined. What is possible only under conditions that might or might not happen isn’t really possible in every way. This is how the question is understood when talking about connections and matter—not just physical matter, but matter as the stuff things are made of, compared to how they are organized.
