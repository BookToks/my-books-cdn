Part II, Division II, Book I talks about an important question we need to answer during our study. We have already made some progress because we separated the special ideas of reason from other ideas. These special ideas are often mixed up by philosophers who don’t clearly see the difference between reason and understanding. Now, we know exactly how many of these ideas there are, and there can’t be more. We also showed how they connect in a system, which helps us understand the limits of pure reason.

It would be best to study these ideas by putting them together first, which is called the synthetic method. But to finish our big project, it’s better to start by breaking things down, called the analytic method. This means we begin with what we experience directly, starting from the soul, then moving to the world, and finally to the knowledge of God.

The Transcendental Dialectic, in Book Two, talks about how pure reason sometimes makes guesses based on ideas we don’t fully understand. These ideas come from reason naturally, following its own rules, even though we don’t have clear concepts of what they really are.
