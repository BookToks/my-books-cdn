Time is not just about how we see things outside us. All the thoughts and ideas we have, whether about outside things or not, happen inside our minds. These inner thoughts happen in time because time is how we experience our own inner state. So, time is a basic condition for anything we can experience, both inside ourselves and outside in the world. Just like space is the way we understand where things are outside, time is the way we understand when things happen.

If we try to think about things without considering how we experience time inside ourselves, then time doesn’t really exist on its own. Time only matters for the things we see or sense around us. It isn’t something that exists outside of us by itself. Time is a kind of condition that depends on how humans sense and understand things, and it only applies to the way we experience the world. So, while everything we experience happens in time, we can’t say that all things in general exist in time without our way of sensing them.

What we’re saying is that time is real for anything we can experience with our senses. Since we always experience things through our senses, everything we encounter happens in time. But we don’t believe that time is a real, absolute thing that exists on its own, no matter what. Time isn’t a property that things have by themselves if we ignore how we sense them. These things, which exist on their own beyond our senses, can’t be understood through time. This is why time is called "transcendentally ideal" — it doesn’t exist by itself outside of our experience.
