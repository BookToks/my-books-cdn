Kant disagreed with the famous "ontological" argument for God's existence. This argument, originally from St. Anselm and later improved by Descartes and Leibniz, said we can prove God exists just by thinking about what God means. But Kant said this proof only shows what we already think about God, not that God really exists.

At first, Kant tried a different argument, saying God must exist as the reason everything is possible. Later, he rejected this idea too. However, he kept criticizing the ontological argument and explained why it doesn’t work. His criticism helped him develop an important idea in his book, the Critique of Pure Reason. He said that real truths in math, science, and philosophy are not just about analyzing ideas but need a new way of thinking beyond just breaking down concepts.

Also, in his work called Nova dilucidatio, Kant disagreed with the idea from Leibniz and Baumgarten called monadology. This idea said everything true about a thing comes from its own nature, and any interaction between things is just part of God’s perfect plan for the world.

Kant argued instead that things affect each other directly. He called this the "Principle of Succession," meaning nothing changes unless it’s connected to something else. This means everything depends on something else, and their connections cause changes. Kant used this idea to support the view that physical objects really do interact in space and time.

Finally, Kant said that all changes we notice in our perceptions must come from changes in physical objects. This, he argued, proves that physical things really exist.
