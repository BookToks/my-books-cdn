David Hume was a famous thinker who studied human reason. He believed that some big questions were beyond what human reason could understand, even though he couldn’t clearly define where the limits were. He focused mainly on the idea of cause and effect. Hume said that we can’t prove this idea just by thinking about it; instead, we believe it because it’s useful and we get used to it through experience. From this, he concluded that reason can’t really go beyond what we experience.

This way of thinking, where reason is checked and sometimes questioned, can be called the censorship of reason. This definitely makes us doubt any use of ideas that go beyond experience. But this is only the second step, and it doesn’t finish the job. The first step, when reason is young, is to believe things without much question. The second step is skepticism, which means being careful and doubting things based on experience. But there is a third step, which only mature reason can take.

The third step is about fully examining reason itself—its ability to understand things without experience. This is called the critique of pure reason. It doesn’t just find limits or areas we don’t know; it actually proves where those limits are. Skepticism is a resting place for reason to think about its doubts and figure out where it stands. But it’s not where reason should stay forever. True certainty, either about things themselves or about the limits of what we can know, is the final goal.

Our reason is not like an endless flat surface that goes on forever. Instead, it’s more like a sphere, where we can figure out the size and boundaries by looking at the curve of its surface. This means we can understand both what reason can know and where it stops.
