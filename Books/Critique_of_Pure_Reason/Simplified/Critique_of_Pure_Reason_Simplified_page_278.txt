Trans. deduction of pure concepts of understanding <B> (as it were a system of the epigenesis48 of pure reason): namely that the categories contain the grounds of the possibility of all experience in general from the side of the understanding. But more about how they make experience possible, and which principles of its possibility they yield in their application to appearances, will be taught in the following chapter on the transcendental use of the power of judgment.
 
 If someone still wanted to propose a middle way between the only two, already named ways, namely, that the categories were neither self­ thought priori first principlesa of our cognition nor drawn from ex­ a perience, but were rather subjective predispositions for thinking, implanted in us along with our existence by our author in such a way that their use would agree exactly with the laws of nature along which experience runs (a kind of prefonnation-system49 of pure reason), then (besides the fact that on such a hypothesis no end can be seen to how far one might drive the presupposition of predetermined predis­ positions for future judgments) this would be decisive against the supposed middle way: that in such a case the categories would lack the B 168 necessity that is essential to their concept. For, e.g., the concept of cause, which asserts the necessity of a consequent under a presupposed condition, would be false if it rested only on a subjective necessity, ar­ bitrarily implanted in us, of combining certain empirical representations according to such a rule of relation.b I would not be able to say that the effect is combined with the cause in the object:" (i.e., necessarily), but only that I am so constituted that I cannot think of this repre­ sentation otherwise than as so connected; which is precisely what the skeptic wishes most, for then all of our insight through the supposed objective validity of our judgments is nothing but sheer illusion, and there would be no shortage of people who would not concede this subjective necessity (which must be felt) on their own; at least one would not be able to quarrel with anyone about that which merely depends on the way in which his subject is organized.
 
 Brief concept of this deduction.
 
 It is the exhibition of the pure concepts of the understanding (and with them of all theoretical cognition priori) as principlesd of the possi­ a bility of experience, but of the latter as the detennination of appearances in space and time in general-and the latter, finally, from the B 169 a Principien b Verhii/tnisses , Objecte Principien d 265 Doctrine of Elements.
