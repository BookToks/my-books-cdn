The pure concepts of understanding (called categories) are like the basic rules that make all experience possible from the side of our mind. But more about how they help us have experiences, and what rules they give us when we apply them to what we see, will be explained in the next chapter about how we use judgment.

Some people might suggest a middle idea between the two main views. They might say that categories are not first principles we think of on their own, nor are they learned from experience. Instead, these categories could be natural ways of thinking that were put inside us when we were made, matching the laws of nature perfectly. This idea is like saying our reason was pre-formed to fit the world.

But this idea has problems. For example, if the concept of cause (where one thing always leads to another) was just a personal rule inside us, not something necessary in the world, then it wouldn’t be true that effects really follow causes. We would only be built to think this way, not that it actually happens. This is exactly what skeptics want, because then all our beliefs about the world would just be illusions. Also, people might not agree to this personal way of thinking since it's just about how their own mind works, and you can’t argue about something that depends only on each person’s own brain.

In short, this deduction shows that the pure concepts of understanding, along with all knowledge we have before experience, are the principles that make experience possible. Experience itself is about how things appear to us in space and time.
