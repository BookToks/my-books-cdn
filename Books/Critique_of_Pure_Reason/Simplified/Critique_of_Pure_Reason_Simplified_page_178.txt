When we talk about time, it has a kind of reality when we experience it, but it doesn’t exist by itself outside of us. Time is just how we see things happening, not the things themselves.

Some people argue against this idea. They say that changes really happen because we notice things changing inside us, even if we ignore everything outside. Since changes happen only in time, time must be real. This is a good point, and I agree with it.

Time is real, but it’s real as the way we experience things inside our minds. It’s not something out there like an object. It’s just how we understand ourselves. If we could be aware of ourselves without needing time, then we wouldn’t think about changes or time at all. So time is real only when we experience things.

But time isn’t absolutely real by itself. It’s just the way we feel things inside us. We can say that our thoughts follow one after another, but that only means we notice them in order, because of how our mind works. Time doesn’t exist on its own or stick to things outside us.

In short, space and time aren’t just confusing ideas in our mind. They are the way we experience things, but they don’t exist as real things on their own. They belong to how we see the world, not to the world itself.
