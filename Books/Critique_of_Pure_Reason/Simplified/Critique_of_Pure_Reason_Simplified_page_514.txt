This is about the difference between two ways of thinking: Epicureanism and Platonism. Both try to explain things, but each goes beyond what they really know. Epicureanism helps us learn more, but it’s not very useful in real life. Platonism gives good ideas for real life, but it lets reason make up perfect explanations about nature instead of studying it closely.

Now, about the choice between these two ideas: it’s weird that empiricism, which is based on experience, is actually the opposite of what most people believe. You might think people would prefer ideas that come from experience and logic, instead of complicated theories that are hard to understand, even for smart people. But the opposite happens. People like empiricism because it doesn’t make them feel stupid. If they don’t understand something, no one else really does either. And even if they can’t explain things as well as experts, they can still think about them more freely because they are not stuck following strict rules.

There’s also a question about whether Epicurus’s ideas were meant as firm facts or just as helpful advice for thinking. If they were just advice, then Epicurus was as thoughtful as the greatest ancient philosophers. He said that when we try to explain what we see, we should act like there are no limits to what we can investigate. We should look at the world as it really is through experience, believe that everything happens because of fixed natural laws, and not use causes outside the world. These are still good ideas today, but many people ignore them. Those who say we shouldn’t use these ideas when just thinking about things might be wrong to do that.
