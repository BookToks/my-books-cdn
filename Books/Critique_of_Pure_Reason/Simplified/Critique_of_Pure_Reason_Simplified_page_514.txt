On the interest of reason in these conflicts This is the opposition of Epicureanism* and Platonism.69 Each of the two says more than it knows, but in such a way that the A472 / B 500 first encourages and furthers knowledge, though to the disadvantage of the practical, the second provides principles which are indeed excela lent for the practical, but in so doing allows reason, in regard to that of which only a speculative knowledge is granted us, to indulge in ideal explanations of natural appearances, and to neglect the physical investigation of them.
 
 Finally, as to the third moment that can be seen in the provisional choice between the two conflicting parties, it is exceedingly strange that empiricism is completely contrary to everything popular, although one might have thought that the common understanding would eagerly take up a proposal promising to satisfy it through nothing but cognitions of experience and their rational connection, in place of transcendental dogmatism, which compels it to ascend to concepts far surpassing the insight and rational faculties even of those minds most practiced in thinking. But just this is its motive. For then it finds itself in a state in A473/B501 which even the most learned can take nothing away from it. If it understands little or nothing of these matters, neither can anyone else boast that they understand much more; and even if it cannot speak about them with as much scholastic correctness as others do, it can still ratiocinateb infinitely more about them, because it is wandering among * There is still a question, however, whether Epicurus ever presented these A47IiB499 principles as objective assertions. If they were perhaps nothing more than maxims of the speculative employment of reason, then in them he would have shown as genuine a philosophical spirit as any of the sages' of antiquity.d That in the explanation of appearances one must go to work as though the field of investigation were not cut off by any boundary or beginning of the world; that one must assume the material of the world as it has to be if we are to be taught about it by experience; that no other way of generating occurrences than their determination through unalterable namrallaws, and finally that no cause distinct from the world are to be employed: even now these are principles, very A4721B500 correct but little observed, for extending speculative philosophy while finding out the principles' of morality independently of alien sources; if only those who demand that we ignore those dogmatic propositions, as long as we are concerned with mere speculation, might not also be accused of trying to deny them.
