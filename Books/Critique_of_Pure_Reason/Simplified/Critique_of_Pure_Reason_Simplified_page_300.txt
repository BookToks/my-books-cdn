All the ways we put ideas together to understand things only happen when our mind combines many simple parts into one whole. This is how we see things in space or time, by joining similar pieces and realizing they fit together as one.

Being aware of these similar parts working together is what makes it possible for us to think about objects. This idea is called a "magnitude." So, even when we just see an object, it’s because our mind unites many small bits of what we sense into one big picture. All appearances we see are magnitudes because they take up space or time, and we understand them by combining parts just like we do with space and time.

An "extensive magnitude" is something where the parts come before the whole, meaning you can think about the whole only after you imagine all its parts. For example, I can’t picture a line, no matter how short, without first thinking about all the little points that make it up, one after another. It’s the same with even the tiniest moment of time—I think about time as a series of moments that add up to make a total amount.

We can’t understand objects in the world except as magnitudes because our mind arranges everything in time and space. This way of putting things together is what lets us experience the world and know objects as having size or length or duration.
