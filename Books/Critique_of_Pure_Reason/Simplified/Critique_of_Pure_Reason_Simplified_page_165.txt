If our ability to sense things includes some basic ideas that come before experience, which make it possible for us to receive objects, then this ability belongs to a special kind of philosophy called transcendental philosophy. 

The study of how our senses work will be part of the first section of this philosophy because the way we get objects through our senses happens before we start thinking about those objects.
