When we make a synthetic judgment, we connect two ideas at the same time. For example, if I say, "A person who doesn’t know something isn’t knowledgeable," this can change over time—someone who doesn’t know something now might learn it later. But if I say, "No one who doesn’t know something is knowledgeable," this is an analytic statement. That means the idea of not knowing is already part of the idea of being unlearned, so it’s true by definition and doesn’t need extra proof. That’s why I changed the way I wrote it above, to make this clearer.

The explanation of how synthetic judgments work is not something general logic deals with, and it might not even care about it. But in a special kind of logic called transcendental logic, it’s super important—actually, it’s the main thing. This logic tries to understand how synthetic judgments can be true before we experience anything, and also where and when they apply. Once it figures this out, transcendental logic can fully explain how our understanding works.

In an analytic judgment, I only look at what the idea already includes. If it’s a positive statement, I just say something the idea already has. If it’s negative, I just say what it doesn’t have. But in synthetic judgments, I have to think beyond the idea and connect it with something different. This connection isn’t about being the same or opposite. Also, you can’t tell if the judgment is true or false just by looking at the idea itself.

Since you have to go beyond the original idea to connect it with another one in a synthetic way, there has to be something else that helps join the two ideas. So, what is this “something else” that makes synthetic judgments possible?

There’s only one place where all our ideas come together, and that’s our inner sense—basically, our awareness inside ourselves—and the way we understand time without needing to experience it first. The imagination helps combine ideas, but the real connection that makes judgment possible comes from the unity of self-awareness.
