If you take away the special way we sense things, called sensibility, then the idea of time disappears too. Time isn’t something that belongs to the objects themselves, but only to the person who experiences them.

The reason many people disagree with this idea is because they don’t believe you can prove that space is real. They think the reality of things outside us can’t be proven for sure. But they do believe that what we feel inside ourselves—our own thoughts and feelings—is definitely real. They think outside things might just be an illusion, but their inner experiences are definitely real.

However, they didn’t realize that both outside things and inner feelings are just appearances. Appearances have two sides: one is the object itself, which we can’t fully understand; the other is how the object appears to us, which depends on the person experiencing it. This way of appearing belongs to how we represent the object, not to the object itself.

Time and space are like two main ways we understand things. From them, we get important knowledge even before we experience anything. For example, math is based on space and how things relate in space. Together, time and space are the pure forms of how we sense everything, and they let us make certain kinds of true statements without needing experience first.

But because time and space are just conditions of how we sense things, they only apply to things as they appear to us. They don’t show us things as they really are in themselves. This is where they are useful, and beyond that, they don’t work.

Still, this doesn’t change how sure we are about what we experience. We are just as sure about our experiences whether time and space are really part of things themselves or just part of how we see things. But anyone who says time and space are absolutely real, existing on their own or inside things, will end up clashing with what experience shows us.
