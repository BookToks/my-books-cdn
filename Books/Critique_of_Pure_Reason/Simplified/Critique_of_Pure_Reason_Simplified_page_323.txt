When I think about something happening, I imagine it as an event that fits into a specific place in time. This event comes after something else, and it can’t be moved to before that thing. So, if I see that something happens, I first know that something else came before it. This is how we understand the order of events—each thing happens after another, following a rule.

Because of this rule, I can’t mix up the order and say that something happened before what actually came first. Also, if the first event is real, then the next event must happen right after it. This creates a clear order in our minds, where the event I’m thinking about now comes after something else, and it depends on that earlier event.

It’s a basic rule of how we sense time that one moment has to come after the one before it. I can’t jump ahead in time without going through the moments leading up to it. Because of this, what happened before decides what happens next. Events only happen because the earlier ones make them happen in a certain order. We can only understand this flow of time by seeing how events connect.

Understanding is part of all our experiences. Its first job isn’t to make things clear right away, but to make it possible to think about things at all. It does this by putting events in order, giving each one a spot in time based on what came before. Without this order, events wouldn’t fit into time properly, because time itself sets the order of everything.

This order doesn’t come from some absolute clock we can see, since we can’t actually perceive time itself. Instead, the events we see help us figure out where they fit in time by how they relate to each other.
