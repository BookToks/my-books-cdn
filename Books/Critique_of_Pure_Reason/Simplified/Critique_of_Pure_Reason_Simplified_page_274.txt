The pure concepts of understanding come from how we think and how we experience things. In one part, we saw that these ideas match up with how we think logically. Now, we want to explain how these ideas help us understand things before we even experience them.

Basically, these concepts help us know the rules for how things can be combined in our experience. They are like laws that nature follows, which our mind sets before we even see or feel anything. Without these concepts, we wouldn’t understand why everything we sense follows certain rules.

First, when I say “synthesis of apprehension,” I mean how our mind puts together different parts of what we see or feel so we can actually notice and understand it.

We have ways to sense things outside and inside ourselves, which we already know as space and time. Any combination of what we experience must fit with space and time because that’s how we sense things.

Space and time aren’t just empty ideas; they are like containers that hold all the things we sense. They help us make sense of all the different parts by keeping them together as one experience.

So, the unity of what we sense comes from space and time themselves, not just from our thinking. They give us the basic way to organize what we experience before we even start to think about it.
