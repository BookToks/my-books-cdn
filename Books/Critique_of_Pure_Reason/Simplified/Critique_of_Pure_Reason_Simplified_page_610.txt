People who study nature think in different ways. Some like to keep things simple and don’t like the idea that there are many kinds of things. Others, who pay close attention to details, try to divide nature into so many different kinds that it becomes hard to understand anything by general rules.

The second group follows a logical idea: starting with a big group, like a genus, they break it down into smaller groups or species. Then those species can be broken down even more into subspecies. This is because each big group needs smaller groups inside it. You can’t say any species is the smallest group because each one still has parts that belong to smaller groups. 

This idea means you should not just ignore or reduce the number of different kinds of things quickly. But this rule only makes sense if it’s based on a bigger rule that says the mind should always look for smaller groups inside bigger ones. This doesn’t mean there are endless kinds of things, but it means we should keep looking for smaller and smaller differences.

If there were no smaller groups, there would be no bigger groups either. Our understanding works by using concepts, and no matter how much we divide things into smaller parts, we always use concepts to understand them.
