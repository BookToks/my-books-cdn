Our reason works by trying to connect different ideas step by step. It focuses on understanding how things are related by conditions, like causes or dependencies. Reason doesn’t try to figure out everything that happens after; it only looks for the starting point that explains everything else.

Once we have the basic, unchanging condition, we don’t need reason to keep going. Our understanding on its own can figure out what comes next from that starting point. So, transcendental ideas help us move up to find the ultimate cause or principle, but they don’t help us move down to the effects or details.

When we think about all the future changes in the world, that’s just a thought we create—it’s not something reason demands must be true. Reason only needs to know all the conditions that make something possible, not every single result that will happen.

Because of this, ideas about the total series of future events aren’t transcendental ideas, which is what we are really interested in here.

We also notice that these transcendental ideas connect with each other, and reason uses this to organize all our knowledge into a system. Moving from understanding ourselves, to understanding the world, and then to understanding the original being or cause feels natural, like moving step by step from a starting idea to a conclusion.

Philosophy’s main goal is to study three big ideas: God, freedom, and immortality. These ideas connect, leading from one to the next naturally. Everything else in philosophy helps us reach these ideas and understand their reality. We don’t need these ideas for science, but to go beyond nature.

Understanding these ideas would make theology, morals, and religion the highest goals of our lives, based only on reason and nothing else. A good system of these ideas would follow this order.
