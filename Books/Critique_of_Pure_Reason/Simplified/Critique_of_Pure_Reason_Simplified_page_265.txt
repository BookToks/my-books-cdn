For example, when I say "Bodies are heavy," I don’t mean that these ideas always happen together in what we see or feel. Instead, they belong together because our mind connects them in a necessary way. This connection happens because of how our mind combines different experiences into one understanding, based on certain rules. These rules come from the idea that our self-awareness is always unified.

Because of this, we can make a judgment that is true for everyone, not just something that feels true to us personally. For instance, I might say, "If I carry a body, I feel its weight," which is just based on my experience. But if I say, "The body is heavy," I’m saying these two ideas belong together in the object itself, no matter who is experiencing it. It’s not just that I notice them together over and over, but that they really are connected.

All the things we sense follow certain basic categories. These categories help our mind bring together all the different parts we see or feel into one clear idea.

The many details we get from our senses are connected by our self-awareness, which makes it possible to understand them as one thing. The way our mind does this is through judging, which means it organizes the different pieces of information.

These categories are basically the kinds of judgments our mind makes. So, the details we get from our senses always fit into these categories.
