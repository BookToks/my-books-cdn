The main idea of the Critique of Pure Reason is that the same thing that lets us understand the basic rules behind science also makes it possible for us to be free in what we decide and do. This freedom seems threatened because nature follows strict cause and effect rules. Kant says we can be sure about the rules of science because they come from how our own minds work. These rules are the reason we can have experiences, as we organize what we sense from the world around us. So, we are not just receiving information; we also shape it using our thinking. This means we can trust the basic laws of science—especially the idea that every event has a cause—because this idea is necessary for us to make sense of what we experience.

Back in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, scientists used the idea of cause and effect more and more to explain things, but some philosophers started to doubt it. At first, thinkers like Descartes and Malebranche supported it with religious reasons. Later, others like Leibniz saw it as just a pattern, and Hume said it was only a habit of thinking. Kant, however, said that events really are connected in a necessary way for time to make sense. He believed that our mind puts the idea of cause and effect onto our experience, and this is needed for us to have any experience at all. So, human understanding actually sets the rules for nature. Science works well because it follows these rules, which come from how our minds are built. At the same time, nature is something we sense and think about, and the rule of cause and effect only applies to the world as we experience it. This idea not only proves the cause and effect rule is certain but also shows that human free will can exist, even though cause and effect seem to rule everything.

Kant says that if we see the rule of cause and effect and other scientific principles as things our minds create and put on experience, then it’s possible for humans to fully control their own actions. This happens when we think about the will not just as it appears to us, but as it really is inside itself.
