Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter III

A rule that guides how we think is changed into something that actually makes things real. This change shows itself because if I think about this highest being, which must exist no matter what, as something on its own, no idea can really explain why it has to exist. So, this idea must only be something in my mind that helps me think clearly, not something that actually exists for real.

Chapter Three, Section Six: Why we can’t prove God’s existence using nature

If neither the idea of things in general nor any experience of something existing can prove this, one last way is left: to look at the world we live in, how things are made and ordered, and see if that can prove there is a highest being. This kind of proof is called the physico-theological proof.

If this way doesn’t work either, then no smart thinking can really prove that a being like our big idea of God actually exists.

From everything said above, it’s clear that the answer to this question is simple and clear. How can any experience match an idea? An idea is special because no real experience can ever fully match it.

The big idea of a necessary, all-powerful first cause is so huge and beyond anything we can experience, that sometimes we can’t even find enough real examples to understand it. Also, if you try to find something unlimited by only looking at limited things, you will keep searching forever without success because no rule from what we experience will ever show such a thing or how to find it.

If the highest being was just part of the chain of causes and effects, it would be just another link in the chain. Then, like the others, we would have to keep searching for something even higher.

But if we say it’s separate from this chain, and only exists as a pure idea, not part of natural causes, then how can our reason connect to it? Because all our thinking about causes and effects is based on following rules that connect things we can see and experience.
