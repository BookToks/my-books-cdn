It is certain that an endless series of actual moments, each one coming after the other up to now, cannot have already happened. So, the world must have had a beginning.

For the second part, the problem of an infinite series that already passed doesn't come up because an infinitely large world exists all at once.

But to understand the whole of such a huge collection, where we can't use clear boundaries to define it, we have to explain how our idea works. We can't think of the whole first and then its parts. Instead, we have to build the idea of the whole by putting the parts together one after another.

Since this building process never finishes, we can never think of the whole as completed before or during the process. The idea of the whole means the parts have been fully put together, but this completion is impossible.

This [quantum] includes many parts, more than any number we can think of, and that is what the math idea of infinity means.
