There is no rule for using pure reason just to think about ideas by itself, because this kind of thinking is always about arguing or debating. Instead, transcendental logic is more like a set of rules or training for thinking.

So, if pure reason is going to be used properly, there has to be some kind of rule for it. But this rule won’t be about just thinking or guessing; it will be about using reason to guide actions. That’s what we will look at now.

Reason naturally wants to go beyond what we experience and explore big ideas just by thinking. It wants to find peace by creating a complete and organized system of understanding. But is this desire just for thinking, or is it really about practical goals?

I will ignore the lucky guesses of reason for now and focus only on the problems that, when solved, reach its ultimate goal. All other goals are just steps leading to this main one. These highest goals must be connected in a way that helps humanity move forward as a whole.

The main goal that reason’s big ideas aim at involves three things: freedom of the will, the soul living forever, and the existence of God. Reason is not very interested in these just for thinking’s sake, and trying to prove them is very hard and frustrating. Plus, any discoveries wouldn’t really help us understand nature better.

The will might be free, but this only applies to the part of our will that we can’t see or measure. Because of an important basic rule, we have to explain our actions like we explain everything else in nature—by following unchanging natural laws.
