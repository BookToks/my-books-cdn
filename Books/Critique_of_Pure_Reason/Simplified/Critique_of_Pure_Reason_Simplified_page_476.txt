When we talk about limits, moving forward is also like going backward. The big idea of having a complete set of all conditions applies to space too. I can ask about all the things that appear in space or in past time. But whether we can find an answer to these questions will be known later.

Second, reality in space, like matter, depends on other things. Its parts and the parts of those parts are all connected, making a chain of conditions. This chain goes backward too, and reason wants to find the complete whole. This can only happen if matter breaks down completely, either disappearing or turning into something simple. So, here too, there is a series going toward something without conditions.

Third, when we look at how things relate to each other, the idea of substance and its accidents doesn’t fit the big idea of reason. Accidents (which are qualities of a substance) are linked to each other but don’t form a chain. Substances themselves don’t really have accidents under them but exist through those accidents.

You might think the idea of something “substantial” fits here. But this just means an object existing by itself without qualities. Since we are only talking about things without conditions in a series of appearances, “substantial” doesn’t fit. The same is true for groups of substances, which are just collections and don’t form a chain because they aren’t connected as conditions for each other. This is different from spaces, which always have boundaries defined by other spaces.

So, only the idea of cause and effect remains. This gives a chain of causes for an effect, where you can move from the effect (which is caused) up to the causes (which are conditions). This answers reason’s question. Fourth, ideas like possible, actual, and necessary don’t make a chain unless you see that things that happen by chance are always caused by something else. This leads to a higher cause until reason reaches a cause that has no conditions at all.
