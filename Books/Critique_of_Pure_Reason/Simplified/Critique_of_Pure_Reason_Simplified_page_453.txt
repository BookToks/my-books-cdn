1. There are three kinds of combining ideas: first, combining the conditions for any kind of thought in general.  

2. Second, combining the conditions for thinking about things we experience.  

3. Third, combining the conditions for pure thinking, without any experience.  

In all three cases, pure reason is only interested in the complete combination of these conditions—meaning the condition that doesn’t depend on anything else. This idea leads to three common mistakes in thinking, which cause three parts in the Dialectic and give us ideas for three imaginary sciences: psychology, cosmology, and theology. Here, we only focus on the first one.  

When we think in general, we ignore how the thought relates to any real object (whether from our senses or understanding). So, combining conditions for a thought in general isn’t about objects at all but only about how the thought connects to the thinker. However, people often wrongly believe this is about real objects.  

Because of this, the mistake in reasoning about the conditions of every thought is not about what it says, since it leaves out all objects, but about how the reasoning is done. This kind of mistake is called a paralogism.  

Also, since the only thing that always comes with thinking is the “I,” in the statement “I think,” reason deals with this “I” as if it is unconditioned. But really, it’s just the formal condition—the logical unity of every thought—where we ignore any object. Still, this “I” is seen as if it were an object itself, with its own unchanging unity.  

If someone asked me, “What makes up a thing that thinks?” I wouldn’t be able to answer without experience, because the answer needs to add new knowledge. Just explaining thinking doesn’t tell us what makes thinking possible. To answer fully, we need experience, but this question is too general for that.  

Similarly, no one can say exactly what kind of thing can move without knowing it has a certain kind of matter. Even though I can’t give a general answer, I feel like I could answer about a specific case, like when someone is aware of themselves thinking.
