Part II, Division I, Book II, Appendix talks about how things have an inner part and an outer part, but only in how we understand them. Things must have something inside that isn’t connected to anything outside. This inner part can’t be about where it is, its shape, or how it moves because those are all things on the outside. So, the inner part of things is really just about their own “pictures” or ideas inside themselves.

These inner parts make up what we call monads, which are the basic building blocks of everything in the universe. Monads have power, but it’s only through their own inner pictures or ideas, and this power only works inside themselves.

Because everything is just inside and focused on its own ideas, monads can’t directly affect each other. So, there has to be some other force or cause that makes sure their states match up. This isn’t because they physically influence each other but because they all follow the same overall plan or law made by one cause, which keeps everything working together.

Leibniz’s ideas about space and time came from trying to understand these inner connections. He thought space was the way substances are arranged together, and time was the order of their changes. But space and time don’t actually exist on their own; they are just ways we understand how things relate to each other. Space and time are like the way we organize the connections between things and their changes.

The things themselves are real substances that we can only understand through ideas (called noumena). But Leibniz wanted these ideas about space and time to also apply to what we see and experience. He believed that our senses don’t give us true information by themselves but just mix up and confuse the real ideas we have in our minds.
