In Kant's next letter to Herz, written three years later in November 1776, he says he is still having trouble with the main idea of his new work. He mentions that he made some progress the previous September and promises to finish the book by the next Easter. But in August after that, Kant says there is still a big problem blocking the Critique of Pure Reason. Still, he’s hopeful he can solve it during the winter of 1778.  

By April 1778, Kant writes that rumors about his book being printed are not true yet. In August, he only says he is "still working hard" on his "handbook." So, for at least five years, the book keeps getting delayed. There are many hints that Kant still hasn’t found the key idea he needs, probably the one that answers his big question from 1772. From the letters to Herz, who was the only person Kant talked to about the book at that time, it might seem like Kant wasn’t making any progress. But other sources show he really was working hard on the Critique during this time.  

Starting in April 1774, around the time he first promised to finish the book, Kant began trying to solve the puzzle about why certain basic ideas from the mind must apply to the things we sense and don’t work outside of that.  

In 1774-75, Kant used a letter he got on April 28, 1774, as scratch paper to write notes for the Critique. Much of what he wrote repeated ideas about space and time he had already explained before. But now he added a new idea: the fact that time is one and continuous means the self is also one, and all objects have a fixed place in time. He said that space being unified depends on the self too, and on the self’s ability to place objects in specific positions in space. Then he suggested that the mind’s concepts are needed exactly to bring together and organize the way we experience objects in time and space. In his own words, he first said: "Time is unique."
