Even though Kant didn’t really care much about the history of philosophy as a subject, in his short work called "History of Pure Reason," he explained how modern philosophy grew by going beyond two main ideas: empiricism and rationalism. His own critical philosophy became the new way of thinking, and we still use his pattern today, but we also add ideas from the philosophers who came after him.

Now that we understand how the Critique of Pure Reason is organized, let’s quickly go over what it’s about.

In the "Introduction," Kant talks about transcendental philosophy. He often says that the most important part of his work is criticizing old, dogmatic metaphysics, but first, he explains his positive ideas about the basic parts of human knowledge that come before experience. Kant says that the kinds of math, science, and everyday knowledge we have need certain judgments that are "synthetic," meaning they tell us something new beyond the basic meanings of words, and yet we can know them without needing specific experiences. He calls the question of how these kinds of judgments are possible the "general problem of pure reason" and says we need a totally new kind of science to answer it.

This new science, which Kant calls "transcendental," doesn’t look directly at things we observe, but studies what makes it possible for us to experience anything at all by looking at how our mind works. Kant agrees with Locke that we don’t have any knowledge built into us from birth. Instead, experience happens because outside objects affect our senses, and our mind reacts to this. Kant’s idea is that we can know the parts of experience that come from how our mind works, not just from the outside objects themselves. He says our mind has two main parts: one that receives sensations from outside objects, called receptivity, and one that actively organizes these sensations into ideas using concepts, called understanding.
