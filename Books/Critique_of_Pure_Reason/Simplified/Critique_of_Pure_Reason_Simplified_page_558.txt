Using the idea of the regulative principle doesn’t change, even if the way it shows its effects changes. No state comes before another to decide what happens next, so reason isn’t part of the chain of things that happen naturally and can be sensed. Reason is involved in everything people do, at all times, and it stays the same. But reason itself isn’t in time and never changes to a new state. When something new happens, reason decides it but isn’t changed by it. So, we can’t ask why reason didn’t decide differently. Instead, we can only ask why it didn’t decide to change what we see and experience. But no one can answer that.

If reason had a different kind of character, then what we experience would be different. If we say someone could have chosen not to lie, no matter their past, that means reason controls them directly. Reason’s power isn’t affected by time or conditions we sense. Differences in time change how things look to us, but they don’t change how actions connect to reason.

When we judge free actions, we can only understand the cause in terms of reason, not beyond that. We can know actions might be free, meaning they can be decided without being controlled by what we sense. That way, free actions could be the cause of what we experience. But why a person’s character leads to these exact experiences is something we can’t understand or even properly ask about. It’s like asking why space looks the way it does and not some other way.

The question we needed to answer was: Do freedom and natural laws contradict each other in the same action? We answered yes or no by showing that freedom connects to different kinds of conditions than natural laws do. So natural laws don’t affect freedom, and both can happen without messing each other up.
