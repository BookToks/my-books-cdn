When we try to understand the whole world by looking at what we can experience, we find that we never reach a final limit or boundary. This means we can’t find something that is totally unconditioned or absolute just by our experience. That’s because to do that, we would have to see a limit that’s actually nothing or empty space, which is impossible.

This idea means that no matter how far we go in looking back or up a chain of causes, we always find something else that’s still connected to something else. So, we have to keep asking what comes next, even if we don’t know if we can ever experience it.

To solve the first big question about the world, we need to decide if this endless chain we think about is truly infinite or just goes on without a clear end. When we think about all the past events in the world or everything that exists right now, this is just a way of imagining a chain that could keep going.

We only have the idea of the whole world in our minds, not the actual full picture. So, we can’t say for sure how big this chain is. Because of this, we can’t say if the world is definitely finite or infinite. The chain we imagine doesn’t give us a clear answer either way.
