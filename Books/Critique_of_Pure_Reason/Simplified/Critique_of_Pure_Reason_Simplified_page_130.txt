I can’t just assume that God, freedom, and life after death are real just to make my reason useful. At the same time, I have to stop guessing too much with my thinking. That’s because to understand big ideas like that, my thinking would need to use rules that only work with things we can actually experience. If I try to use those rules on things we can’t experience, it would just turn those things into something fake, like an illusion. So, I had to say that we can’t really know everything to make room for faith.

The problem with people who are too sure about metaphysics (big, deep ideas about life and existence) is that they don’t check if their thinking makes sense. This often leads to not believing in what’s right for being a good person, and they get stuck being stubborn about it.

Even though it might not be easy, leaving behind a clear and well-checked system of metaphysics is really important. If you compare careful thinking to random guessing, it’s obvious which one helps us learn better. Young people who want to know more would spend their time better by learning real science instead of arguing about things they don’t understand and never will. Criticism helps stop arguments against religion and morals by showing how the other side doesn’t really know what they’re talking about.

There will always be some kind of metaphysics and arguing in philosophy because that’s just how thinking works. So, the main job of philosophy is to stop bad thinking by cutting off the source of mistakes.

Even though we have to give up some old ideas in science, everything still stays useful and helpful for people. The only ones who lose are the schools that thought they owned those ideas. I ask anyone who is super stubborn if the proofs for things like life after death, free will, or God have ever really changed what most people believe after being taught in schools. The answer is no—they don’t really affect what most people think at all.
