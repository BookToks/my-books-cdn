The main difference between these two types of thinking is in how they work, not what they are about. Some people thought philosophy and math were different because philosophy deals with qualities (like color or shape) and math deals with quantities (like numbers or size), but they got it backwards.

Math works with things you can imagine clearly, like sizes and shapes, without needing to see them first. But qualities, like colors or causes, you can only know by experiencing them in real life. So, you can only understand qualities by thinking about concepts, not by imagining them directly.

For example, you can picture the shape of a cone just by thinking about it, without ever seeing one. But you can’t imagine its color unless you’ve seen it before. Also, you can’t picture the idea of cause by itself — you need an example from experience.

Philosophy and math both study big ideas like infinity or total amounts. Math also looks at differences in shapes, like lines and planes, and qualities like how space continues.

Even though they study some of the same things, philosophy and math think about them in very different ways. Philosophy uses general ideas and talks about them. Math, on the other hand, doesn’t stop at ideas — it quickly moves to imagining these ideas clearly and building on them step by step, based on logical rules.

If you give a philosopher the idea of a triangle and ask them to figure out how its angles add up, they only have the idea of a shape with three sides and three angles. They don’t imagine it in a concrete way like math does.
