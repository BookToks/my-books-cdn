If I understand a drop of water completely, knowing everything about it inside and out, then I can’t say one drop is different from another if they’re exactly the same in every way. But if I see a drop as something that exists in space, then it has a specific spot, not just in my mind but also in the real world. Since places in space don’t care about what’s inside things, a spot b can hold a drop just like spot a does, no matter if the drops are exactly the same or different inside. Just being in different places is enough to make things seem different and separate. So, the idea that things can’t be different just because they’re the same kind of thing isn’t a natural law. It’s just a rule we use when we compare ideas in our heads.

Second, the idea that real things can’t logically oppose each other is true when we talk about ideas, but it doesn’t mean anything about nature or the real world itself, which we can’t fully understand.

Real opposition happens when two things cancel each other out if they try to exist together. We see this all the time in nature with things like obstacles or forces working against each other. Physics, like mechanics, can explain this by looking at things like opposing directions, which pure logic doesn’t cover. Although Leibniz didn’t make a big deal about this, he used this idea in his work, and his followers made it part of their philosophy. They say all problems come from limits in created things, meaning problems are just “negatives” or what’s missing, because only negatives really oppose things in reality. This idea works when thinking about things in general but not when looking at things as they appear to us. People who believe this find it natural to think all reality is one being without any real opposition, because they only see opposition as contradictions in ideas, not as real forces canceling each other out—which we only understand through our senses.

Third, Leibniz’s idea of monads (basic units of reality) is based only on how he described the differences inside these tiny realities, not on any proof outside of that.
