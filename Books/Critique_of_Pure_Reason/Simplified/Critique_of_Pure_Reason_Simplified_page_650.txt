Math is based on definitions, basic rules, and proofs. I will show that none of these things, as mathematicians understand them, can be done or copied by philosophy. Using his method, a mathematician can only build weak ideas in philosophy, like houses of cards. On the other hand, a philosopher using the mathematician’s method can only create meaningless talk in math. Philosophy is all about knowing its limits, and even a smart mathematician can’t ignore these limits or warnings.

When it comes to definitions, the word itself means to clearly show the full idea of something within its limits.

Because of this, you can’t properly define things based just on experience; you can only explain them. This is because with experience-based ideas, you only have some features of things you sense, and it’s never clear if the word you use really covers everything about that thing.
