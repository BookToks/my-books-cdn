I understand myself from the inside, through my own feelings and thoughts. Because of this, my soul’s personality is not something I guess but something I know for sure in my mind over time. This means that whenever I’m aware of myself, I’m aware that all this time belongs to one single “me.” It doesn’t matter if I say all this time is inside me as one person or that I am the same person throughout all this time.

The idea of being the same person comes from my own consciousness. But if someone else looks at me from the outside, they see me as an object in time. For them, time is something they experience themselves, not what I experience inside. So even if they accept that I have an “I” inside my mind, they won’t necessarily believe that my “self” stays the same over time. The time they use to think about me is their own time, not the time I experience inside me.

The fact that I think of myself as the same person at different times is just a rule for how my thoughts connect, but it doesn’t prove that I am exactly the same person over time. Even though I always use the word “I,” my self can change in ways that make it not exactly the same. It’s like when one ball hits another: the motion moves from one ball to the next, and each ball knows the motion from before, but they are still different balls. In the same way, the “I” can carry memories and feelings from before but still not be the exact same person all the time.
