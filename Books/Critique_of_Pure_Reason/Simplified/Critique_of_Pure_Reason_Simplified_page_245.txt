Part II, Division 1, Book 1, Chapter 2

When we think of an object, like a triangle, we understand it by knowing it’s made of three straight lines following a certain rule. This rule helps us always picture the triangle the same way. This rule is what holds everything together and lets us recognize the triangle as one object. The idea of this unity is how we think of the triangle.

All knowledge needs a concept, even if it’s not perfect or clear. These concepts are always general and act like rules. For example, the idea of a body helps us understand things we see outside us by organizing all the details we notice. But this idea only works as a rule if it can bring together all the parts we sense. So, when we see something outside, the idea of a body makes us think of things like size, shape, and that objects can’t pass through each other.

Every necessary idea has a deep reason behind it. We need to find this deep reason for how our minds join all the different parts we sense together, and for the ideas of objects in general. Without this, we couldn’t think about any object at all. An object is basically something that fits the rules our mind uses to combine what we sense.

This deep and original reason is what I call transcendental apperception. The way we feel ourselves inside, based on how we sense things inside us, changes all the time and doesn’t give us a steady self. This changing feeling is called inner sense or empirical apperception. But the self that doesn’t change — the one that stays the same no matter what — can’t be understood just by what we sense. There has to be something before all our experiences that makes them possible, and this is that deeper self.

We can’t have any thoughts or connect them without this unity of consciousness that comes before any experience. It’s only because of this unity that we can think about objects at all. This pure, original, and unchanging consciousness is what I now call transcendental apperception. It’s clear that this is the right name because even the most basic ideas, like space and time, only work because they relate to it. This unity is what makes all our thinking possible.
