The idea I have in my mind is about something real. Even if I think of something missing one part of reality, that missing part doesn’t just appear when I say the thing exists. Instead, it exists with the same problem I already imagined. Otherwise, it would be something different from what I thought.

If I think about a being that is the highest reality and has no flaws, it’s still unclear if it really exists or not. Even though my idea of something real doesn’t miss anything, there’s still something missing when I think about it: I need to be able to know it through experience.

Here’s why it’s hard. If the thing I’m thinking about is something I can sense, then I don’t mix up just thinking about it with it actually existing. When I think about it, I only imagine it fitting the general rules of what I could experience. But if it really exists, I can connect it to everything I have experienced. So the idea itself doesn’t change, but my understanding grows because I might actually see or feel it.

But if I try to think about existence using only pure thinking, without any experience, it’s no surprise I can’t tell the difference between something just possible and something that truly exists.

So no matter how detailed my idea of something is, I have to go beyond the idea to prove it really exists.

For things I can sense, this happens when I connect the idea to something I actually perceive, following natural laws. But for things that are only thoughts, there’s no way to know if they exist because I would have to know this without any experience. All our knowledge of what exists comes from experience or from reasoning that links things to experience. Even though it’s not impossible that something exists outside of experience, we can’t prove it.

The idea of the highest being is helpful in many ways. But because it’s only an idea, it can’t by itself help us know what really exists. It can’t even tell us if anything more is possible. The only thing we know is that this idea doesn’t contradict itself, but that doesn’t prove anything beyond that.
