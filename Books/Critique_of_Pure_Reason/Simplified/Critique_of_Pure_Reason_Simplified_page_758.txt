Kant also uses this idea in another text from around 1780-1789.

You can compare this part with other texts from the 1780s and late 1770s.

Zeno of Elea lived about 500-440 B.C. and was a younger friend of Parmenides. He is famous for his four tricky ideas about things like infinity and motion, which Aristotle talked about. Plato also mentioned Zeno in some of his works, which Kant refers to here.

See some other notes from the late 1770s and 1780s for more on this.

Baumgarten, a philosopher, made a clear difference between the ideas of infinite and indefinite. Descartes also talked about this, saying that true infinity belongs only to God.

Besides the earlier texts mentioned, check out another from 1772 for more details.

Baumgarten’s work also covers some related ideas.

There are two kinds of problems Kant talks about: mathematical and dynamical antinomies. He discussed these in many writings from the late 1770s to the 1790s, explaining their differences and solutions.

Baumgarten also wrote about the idea of a basic soul and the freedom to make choices.

See an earlier note for more information.

Look at several writings from the 1770s and early 1780s for examples.

Kant’s big idea about morality, which became important in his later works from 1785 and 1788, was actually suggested much earlier, around 1770-1781.

In 1763, Kant already criticized the usual proofs for God’s existence in one of his books. He also talked about a similar argument he made back then. Even though this material is old, Kant planned to discuss rational arguments for God’s existence mainly in relation to big contradictions in his drafts from 1775. This mostly meant talking about the cosmological argument.
