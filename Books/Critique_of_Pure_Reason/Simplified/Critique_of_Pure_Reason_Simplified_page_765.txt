Among Kant's notes, check R 29II-68 (from different times, 16:572-89) and R 2993-3008 (from 1769 to the 1780s, 16:606-11).

Kant’s idea of “arbitrarily thought” concepts is similar to Locke’s idea of mixed modes. Mixed modes are always “adequate” because they aren’t made to copy real things but are created by the mind itself, so they only relate to themselves (from Locke’s Essay concerning Human Understanding, book II, chapter 31, section 3).

Kant is talking about a big technical problem in the 18th century: making a clock precise enough to figure out longitude at sea. This was so hard that the British government offered a prize of £20,000 in 1714, but no one fully earned it until 1773. For more details, see John Noble Wilford’s book The Mapmakers (New York: Knopf, 1981), pages 130-6.

Look at R 2920-8 (from 1769-75, 16:576-9) and R 2950 (from the late 1770s to 1780s, 16:585).

Here, Kant uses the word “characteristic” to mean a way of solving problems by giving numbers to ideas. This idea comes from Leibniz, who wanted a “universal characteristic” where all questions could be solved by turning ideas into numbers (see Leibniz’s draft “Preface to a Universal Characteristic” from 1678-79, in Ariew and Garber, pages 5-10).

Kant is talking about the “Antinomy of Pure Reason,” which is a famous problem he worked on.

Johann Georg Sulzer (1720-1779) was a philosopher who led the philosophy section of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. He is mainly remembered for his work on aesthetics, especially in his books about the beauty of nature (Berlin, 1750) and art (Leipzig, 1771-74). He developed a psychological theory saying the main joy in art comes from how our minds feel. Sulzer translated Hume’s first Enquiry (1755) and wrote a prize question for the Berlin Academy in 1763, which Kant answered in 1764. Sulzer also criticized Kant’s early ideas about time. The current reference is to Sulzer’s mixed writings from 1773.

Kant is clearly referring to the arguments in Hume’s Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, published after Hume’s death in 1779. The Dialogues were translated into German in 1781 by Johann Georg Hamann, a writer from Konigsberg who, like his follower Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, used Hume’s ideas to support their own religious beliefs. Because Kant knew Hamann and was interested in Hume, he probably read this translation as soon as it came out or even before.

Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) was an English minister, teacher, scientist, and philosopher. As a scientist, he is famous for discovering oxygen, though others like Cavendish and Lavoisier explained what it meant. As a philosopher, he supported David Hartley’s idea of associationism, believed in materialism (the idea that everything is physical), and said immortality isn’t natural for humans. He also believed in determinism, which means everything is caused by something else. He explained these ideas in two works from 1777: Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit and The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated.
