What we see and experience (called appearances) is not the real thing itself, but it’s the only way we can know anything. Even though we notice things one after another, like seeing different parts of a house step by step, the house itself isn’t made up of parts that come one after another. No one really thinks the house is just a sequence of pieces.

When I think about the house as more than just what I see—for example, as a real thing by itself—it’s actually just how it appears to me. The true nature of the house, the thing itself, is unknown. So when I ask how the different parts of what I see are put together, I’m really asking about how my mind connects these images. The appearances I get are just a bunch of these mental pictures, but I treat them like the real thing. For my understanding to be true, the way I connect these pictures has to follow certain rules.

The part of the appearance that sets these rules is what we call the object. Now, let’s think about something happening—that is, something new starting that wasn’t there before. We can only notice this if we first see that the thing wasn’t there before. We can’t understand something starting from nothing or from empty time. Every time we notice something new happening, it always comes after we noticed something else. This is true for all the things we see one after another. For example, if I see a change happen, I call the first thing I see “A” and the next thing “B.” B always comes after A, but A can’t come after B.
