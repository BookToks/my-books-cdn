In the transcendental aesthetic, we first focus on how we sense things by separating out everything the mind understands through ideas, so only what we actually experience remains. Then, we take away all feelings from that experience, leaving just pure intuition and the basic way things appear, which is the only thing our senses can give us before any experience. When we study this, we find there are two pure forms of sensing that help us know things before experience: space and time. We will now look closely at space.

Through our outer sense (which is part of our mind), we see objects as being outside of us and all placed in space. In space, their shape, size, and how they relate to each other can be figured out. Our inner sense lets our mind understand itself and its own states, but it doesn't give us a direct idea of the soul as an object. Still, it gives a clear way to understand our inner states, which are shown as happening in time. Just like we can't see time as something outside us, we can't see space as something inside us.

So, what are space and time? Are they real things? Or are they just ways of describing how things relate, which would still be true even if we didn’t sense them? Or are they only connected to how we sense things, and only exist because of how our mind works, without which we couldn’t say anything about objects? To figure this out, let's think about space first.

Space is not an idea we get from experience. To understand that things are outside me and in different places, I must already have the idea of space. So, the idea of space can’t come from just looking at how things relate to each other outside me. It has to already be there in my mind.
