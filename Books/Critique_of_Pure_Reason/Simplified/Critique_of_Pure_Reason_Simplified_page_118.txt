Here, I expect my reader to be patient and fair like a judge, but there, I want them to work with me like a teammate. Even if the main ideas of the system are fully explained in the critique, the system itself is so big that it needs other related ideas too. These ideas can’t all be figured out at once but have to be found little by little. Just like before, where all the ideas were put together, now the same should happen with breaking them down, which would be easier and even fun.

I have just a few things to say about the printing of the book. Because printing started late, I only saw about half of the proof sheets. I found a few printing mistakes, but none that change the meaning except one on page 379, fourth line from the bottom, where “specific” should be read instead of “skeptical.” The part called the Antinomy of Pure Reason, from page 425 to page 461, is shown like a table. Everything about the thesis is on the left side, and everything about the opposite idea is on the right side. I did this to make it easier to compare the two ideas.

Whether or not the way reason is explained is a real science can soon be judged by how successful it is.
