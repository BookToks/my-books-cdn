I call the way sensations are arranged in certain relationships the form of appearance. Since the thing that organizes sensations can’t be a sensation itself, the stuff of all appearances is given to us through experience, but its form must already be in our mind before any experience, and so it can be thought about separately from sensations.

I call all ideas pure (in a special way) when they don’t include anything from sensations. So, the pure form of all our senses is already in the mind before we experience anything, where we sense all appearances in certain ways. This pure form of sensing is also called pure intuition. For example, if I ignore what the mind thinks about a body, like substance or force, and also ignore what comes from sensations, like hardness or color, I still have something left: extension and form. These belong to pure intuition, which exists in the mind before we actually sense anything, as just a way the mind is able to sense.

I call the study of all the rules for this kind of sensing the transcendental aesthetic. There has to be a science like this, which is the first part of a bigger study about how we understand things, different from the part about pure thinking, which is called transcendental logic.

By the way, Germans are the only ones who use the word "aesthetics" to mean what others call the study of taste. This happened because a smart thinker named Baumgarten hoped to make judging beauty a science based on reason, but this didn’t work. The rules for judging beauty actually come from experience and can’t be used as strict rules for taste. Instead, our sense of taste tests whether these rules are good or not. So, it’s better to stop using the word "aesthetics" for this and save it for the true science of how we know things, like the ancient thinkers did.
