When we use the rule about how to understand things step by step, the only way to fix the obvious contradiction is in this one way. If every cause has to be something we can sense, and so part of a chain, then that cause also needs a cause (which the fourth antinomy shows). So, either reason keeps fighting with itself by wanting an uncaused cause, or this uncaused cause has to be outside the chain, in a place we can’t sense, where it doesn’t have to follow the rules of cause and effect. This makes it absolutely necessary when we look at the world we can see.

Using reason based on what we can sense isn’t changed by believing in a being we can’t sense. It still works by moving from one cause to a higher cause, and these causes are always things we can sense. But this rule doesn’t stop us from thinking there is an unknown cause outside the chain when we use reason in a pure way, thinking about goals or purposes. Here, this unknown cause means the reason why the whole chain of causes we can sense is even possible. This cause is beyond what we can know, doesn’t depend on the causes we can sense, and is absolutely necessary. This doesn’t go against the idea that causes keep going back forever in the chain we see.

To finish the whole argument about pure reason:

When we use our ideas of reason just to understand all the causes in the world we can sense, and how reason can help with them, our ideas are about how the universe works and are still connected to experience. But when we think about the uncaused cause as something outside the world we can sense, and outside all possible experience, our ideas become something beyond experience. They don’t just help explain the causes we see, but become about things we can’t experience at all. These ideas rely on pure thinking, not on experience, and their reality comes from these pure ideas, not from finishing the chain of causes we know. Such ideas are about things we can only understand with our minds, not things we can actually experience.
