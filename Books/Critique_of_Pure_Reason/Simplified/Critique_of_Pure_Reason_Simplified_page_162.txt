The idea is that there could be a special kind of science called the critique of pure reason.

Reason is the ability that gives us basic rules for understanding things before we experience them. Pure reason means having the rules to understand something completely on its own, without needing experience. An organon of pure reason would be all the rules that let us get all the knowledge we can just by thinking first. If we use these rules fully, we could build a system of pure reason.

But this is a big task, and it’s not clear yet if we can really expand our knowledge this way or when it would work. So, we can think of a science that just studies pure reason itself—its origins and limits—as a first step before building the whole system. This would not be a teaching but a critique of pure reason. Its job would be mostly to clear up mistakes and keep our thinking clean, not to make us know more. Even this is very helpful.

I call all knowledge "transcendental" when it focuses not on things themselves but on how we can know things before experience. A system of ideas like this is called transcendental philosophy. But this is too much to start with.

Since this science would have to cover both kinds of knowledge that come before experience, it’s too broad for now. We only need to analyze enough to understand the basic rules that let us put ideas together before experience, which is our main goal.

This study is not a teaching but a critique. It doesn’t try to give us more knowledge but to check and correct what we think we know. This is what we are focusing on now.
