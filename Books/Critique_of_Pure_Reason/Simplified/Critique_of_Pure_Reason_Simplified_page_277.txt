We can only think about things by using categories, which are basic ideas that help us understand the world. We also need to have something to sense or experience that matches those ideas. All the things we sense come from our experiences, so what we know is based on what we experience.

Experience is how we learn about particular things, but there are some basic rules or laws we understand even before we experience anything. These rules help us know what kind of experiences are possible.

We can't know anything without these categories and our senses working together. Even though our knowledge depends on experience, some parts of what we know come from these basic ideas inside us before any experience.

There are two ways to think about why experience fits with our ideas: either experience creates the ideas, or the ideas make experience possible. It can’t be that experience creates the ideas, because these ideas exist before we experience anything.

So, the ideas must be what make it possible for us to have experiences in the first place. These ideas are not limited by what we sense, but they help us understand the things we experience. Even when we don’t have a specific experience, thinking about things using these ideas can still be useful for understanding ourselves and making choices.
