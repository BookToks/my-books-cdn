Imagine that either the world itself has to exist no matter what, or that there is something inside the world that must exist no matter what. If this is true, then in the changes that happen in the world, there would either be a starting point that has to exist on its own and doesn’t need a cause. But this idea goes against the rule that everything that happens in time has a cause. Or, the changes in the world could go back forever with no starting point. Even if each part depends on something else, the whole thing would still have to exist on its own, which doesn’t make sense. That’s because a group of things can’t be necessary if none of the parts are necessary by themselves.

Now, what if there was something outside the world that had to exist no matter what and caused everything in the world? This cause would have to start all the changes in the world. But if it started to cause things, that would mean it began acting in time and became part of the world’s events. So, it wouldn’t really be outside the world, which goes against the original idea. So, there can’t be anything that absolutely has to exist either inside the world or outside it but still connected to it.

*The word “begin” here means two things. First, it means when a cause starts a chain of effects. Second, it means when the cause itself starts to have the power to cause something. The argument moves from the first meaning to the second.*
