First, we need to clearly explain what we think about how we understand things through our senses, so no one gets the wrong idea.

We want to say that everything we see or feel is just how things appear to us. The things we sense aren’t really exactly how we experience them, and their connections aren’t exactly like they seem. If we take away our own mind or even just how our senses work, then space, time, and the way things relate to each other would disappear too. These appearances don’t exist on their own, but only inside us. What things are like by themselves, without us sensing them, is something we don’t know at all. We only know how we perceive them, which is unique to humans.

Space and time are the basic ways we organize what we sense, and sensations themselves are the stuff we feel. We understand space and time before we even experience anything, so they are called pure intuition. Sensations happen after we experience things, so they are called empirical intuition. Space and time always come with our senses, no matter what we’re sensing, but sensations can be very different.

Even if we could make our perception super clear, it wouldn’t tell us what things really are by themselves. We would only understand how our senses work, always using space and time. What things are like on their own can’t be known, no matter how well we understand their appearances.

Our senses give us a mixed-up picture of things, including only what belongs to the things themselves but mixed with many other parts we can't separate. Thinking of our senses and appearances as something clear and simple is wrong and makes the whole idea useless. The difference between a fuzzy and a clear idea is just about how well we think about it, not about what it actually is.
