Our mind can only understand things in a certain way because it has a built-in way of organizing what we experience. This organization helps us understand time, but it doesn’t show things exactly as they are. Instead, we see things as they appear to us, not as they really are.

When we think about space and time, they help us understand both things outside of us and how we feel inside. These things affect our senses, so we experience them as they seem to us. This doesn’t mean they are just illusions or fake.

In fact, when we see or sense something, the qualities we notice, like color or smell, really belong to the object as we experience it. But these qualities come from how our mind connects with the object, not from the object alone. So, space and time are part of how we experience things, not something that exists by itself in the object.

For example, I don’t mean that objects outside me or my own mind are just illusions. Instead, the way space and time work is part of how I experience them, not part of the objects themselves.

If I treat what I see as just an illusion, that would be my mistake. But the qualities that appear to me, like the color of a rose or the shape of a planet, really do exist as part of how I experience those things. If I wrongly think these qualities belong to the objects completely by themselves, without considering how I see them, then I would be confused.
