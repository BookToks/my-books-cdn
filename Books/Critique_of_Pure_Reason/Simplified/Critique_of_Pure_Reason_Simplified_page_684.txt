But they don’t have a good reason for this, so it’s enough to tell them: “This kind of defense is not needed now.” Everyone has to handle their argument by using a real, clear proof that shows the true reason behind it, so people can see what their logic really says.

If someone argues based on personal feelings or opinions, it’s easy to prove them wrong. But that doesn’t help the person who believes in a fixed idea either, because they also rely on personal opinions and can be challenged the same way. If both sides just argued clearly and directly, they would either realize how hard or even impossible it is to prove their points, and then they could only rely on old traditions. Or, the critique would show where they are wrong, forcing pure reason to give up its unrealistic claims when used just for thinking, and stick to what it should focus on—practical ideas.

It’s disappointing that human reason doesn’t achieve much on its own and even needs rules to control its mistakes and avoid being tricked by itself.
