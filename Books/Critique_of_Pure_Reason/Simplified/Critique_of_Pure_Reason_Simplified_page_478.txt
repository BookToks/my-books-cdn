A system of ideas about the universe asks if it’s even possible to put everything together in one big picture. If you think about everything using only pure ideas, without any real-world experience, you can say that for any one thing, there is a whole chain of causes or conditions behind it. Each thing depends on the one before it.

But when we look at how things actually appear to us, there’s a limit. These conditions come from adding up different pieces of what we see or sense, step by step. Whether this chain can ever be fully complete is still a question. Still, the idea of this complete chain is in our minds, even if we can’t fully connect it to real things we experience.

Since this "unconditioned" thing (something that doesn’t depend on anything else) has to be part of the total chain of causes, we don’t know for sure how or if this total chain really exists. Our thinking moves forward from the idea of a total chain, even though what we really want to find is the unconditioned part, which could be the whole chain or just a part of it.

You can imagine the unconditioned in two ways. One way is that it exists only as the whole chain itself. That means every part in the chain depends on something else, but the entire chain as a whole doesn’t depend on anything. Or, the unconditioned might be just one part of the chain, which doesn’t depend on anything else, while all the other parts depend on it.

In the first idea, the chain is endless with no starting point, meaning it goes back forever and is whole all at once. But you can’t finish tracing it back completely; it’s only infinitely possible to do so. In the second idea, there is a first part in the chain. This first part is like the beginning of the world in time, the edge of space, the simplest piece of the whole, the source of all causes, and the origin of freedom or natural laws.

We use two words, world and nature, that sometimes get mixed up. The world means the complete set of all things that appear or exist. Nature means the system of laws and causes that govern these things. The absolute whole of this chain of causes is always unconditioned, because nothing outside it can cause it. But this whole chain is just an idea or a guess. We still need to study if it’s even possible and how the unconditioned fits into it as a special kind of idea.
