We started by dividing things into categories and figuring out where everything belongs. This place is like an island with natural borders that can’t be changed. It’s called the land of truth, which sounds nice. Around it is a big, rough ocean full of illusions. This ocean tricks travelers with fog and melting ice pretending to be new lands. People searching for discoveries get caught up in these tricks and never find peace or an end to their adventures.

Before we explore this tricky ocean to see if there’s anything real to hope for, it’s a good idea to look again at the land we’re leaving behind. We should ask if we can be happy with what this land offers, or if we have to accept it because it’s the only solid place to stand. We should also ask how we even know this land belongs to us and how we can protect it from others who might want to take it.

We’ve already talked about these questions in detail, but a quick review can help make everything clearer by putting all the ideas together in one place.

We learned that everything our mind understands on its own, without using experience, is meant to help us understand experience better. The basic rules our mind follows, whether they are like math rules or guidelines for how things move and change, are just tools to help us make sense of possible experiences. These rules only work because our mind connects all the pieces of what we imagine and perceive into a unified whole.

Even though these mental rules are true on their own and are the source of all truth, because they explain how experience is possible, they don’t tell us everything by themselves. For example, we can’t fully understand things that exist only in thought, like beings that think and cause things by their own will, without experiencing them. We can’t clearly imagine if such things are possible.

Kant added a note saying we can’t understand the idea of cause without seeing an example in experience. So, we can only think of causes as possible within experience, not outside of it.
