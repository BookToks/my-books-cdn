Pure ideas of understanding deal with how we think about things. But putting together different pieces of information (whether from experience or before experience) is what creates knowledge. At first, this knowledge might be unclear and need more thinking to understand. Still, putting these pieces together is what actually collects and joins them into something meaningful. So, this is the first thing we need to look at when we want to understand how we get knowledge at all.

Putting things together, called synthesis, happens because of our imagination. It’s a natural process in our mind that we usually don’t even notice, but without it, we wouldn’t know anything. Turning this process into clear ideas is the job of understanding, and that’s how we get real knowledge.

Pure synthesis, when done in the right way, creates pure ideas of understanding. This kind of synthesis is based on a foundation of unity that comes before experience. For example, counting numbers is a kind of synthesis based on a common idea, like the group of ten. So, this idea makes putting together many parts necessary.

We can group different ideas under one main idea by analyzing them, which is what general logic does. But transcendental logic shows us how to group not just ideas but the pure act of putting ideas together. First, we get a mix of pure impressions before experience. Second, our imagination puts this mix together, but that still isn’t knowledge. Third, understanding gives unity to this mix by creating concepts, which is necessary to know an object.

The same process that unites different ideas in a sentence also unites the different parts of what we see or imagine. This is called the pure concept of understanding. So, understanding uses the same actions to organize ideas logically and to give real meaning to what we imagine or experience.
