This means that this idea is not a basic rule for understanding in general, nor is it a tool for specific sciences. Instead, it just helps clear up common understanding.

In general logic, the part that explains pure reason must be completely separated from the part that deals with applied logic. The pure part is the real science, even if it’s short and a bit boring, because it shows the basic rules of understanding correctly. Logicians should always remember two things.

First, general logic ignores what we actually think about and focuses only on the way we think.

Second, pure logic doesn’t use any real-world facts, so it doesn’t depend on psychology. It’s a proven system, and everything in it must be known without experience.

What I call applied logic is different from the usual meaning. It shows how we actually use understanding in real life, with all the things that can help or stop us. It looks at things like paying attention, making mistakes, doubting, and believing. General and pure logic are like moral laws about freedom, while applied logic is more like real-life morality, which deals with feelings and desires. This real-life morality isn’t a true science because it depends on experience and psychology, just like applied logic does.

Now, about transcendental logic.

General logic ignores all the content of what we know, meaning it doesn’t care about how our knowledge relates to the object. Instead, it only looks at the form of thinking itself.
