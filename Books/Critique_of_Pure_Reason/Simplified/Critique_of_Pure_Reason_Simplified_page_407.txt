Pure reason doesn’t just copy ideas; it figures them out by thinking. Concepts from understanding come before experience and help us make sense of what we see. But they don’t add anything new beyond how we connect what appears to us. These concepts are what make knowing and identifying things possible. They give us the basics to guess or understand things, and no ideas about objects come before them. Their truth comes from the fact that they shape all our experiences, so they always apply when we experience something.

The phrase "a concept of reason" suggests that these ideas go beyond just what we experience. They deal with knowledge that includes all possible experiences, not just one. No single experience can fully explain these concepts, but every experience fits into them. Concepts of reason help us understand bigger ideas, while concepts of understanding help us make sense of what we notice. If these reason concepts include the “unconditioned” (something that applies to everything), then they deal with something all experiences fit under, but which we can never actually experience itself. Reason leads us to these ideas and uses them to check how useful our experiences are, but these ideas never become part of actual experience. 

If these concepts are truly valid, we can call them correctly reasoned concepts. But if not, they are just tricks or mistakes in reasoning, called sophistical concepts. Whether these ideas are right or wrong will be explained later in the chapter about dialectical reasoning.
