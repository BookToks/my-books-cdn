All my thinking, both about ideas and about doing things, focuses on three big questions: 1. What can I know? 2. What should I do? 3. What can I hope for?

The first question is about what we can understand or learn. I believe we’ve already looked at all the answers and found what reason can accept. But even after all this, we still don’t know the answers to two important problems, just like if we never tried at all. So, when it comes to knowledge, it’s clear that we can’t really know the answers to those two big questions.

The second question is about what actions we should take. This is about doing what’s right and is connected to pure reason, but it’s about morals, not just theory. Because of that, it’s not really something we can criticize or question like ideas.

The third question asks, “If I do what’s right, what can I hope for?” This one is both practical and theoretical. Doing the right thing helps us find an answer to what we can hope for, which is connected to happiness. Hope is about feeling happy, and when we think about morals and rules, hope is like knowledge when we think about facts. Hope means that something should happen because it’s the right thing, and knowledge means something happens because it does happen.

Happiness means feeling satisfied with everything we want, including how much we want it, how strong the feeling is, and how long it lasts. The rule that tells us what to do if we want to be happy is called a rule of prudence, or being practical. But the rule that tells us how to behave to be truly deserving of happiness is called the moral law. The first rule advises us on how to get happiness; the second tells us how to be good enough to deserve happiness.
