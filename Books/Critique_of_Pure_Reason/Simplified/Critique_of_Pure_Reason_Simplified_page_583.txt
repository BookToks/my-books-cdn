This idea starts with the need for something to explain the existence of everything else. This leads to a kind of reasoning that feels natural and convincing, not just for regular people but also for deep thinkers. It’s the main idea behind all proofs in natural theology, and no matter how people try to make it look fancy or complicated, it always follows the same basic pattern.

The proof, which Leibniz called the proof of the world's contingency, goes like this: If something exists, then there must be a being that absolutely has to exist. Since I know I exist, this means there must be an absolutely necessary being. The smaller part of the statement comes from what we experience, and the bigger part is a conclusion drawn from that experience. 

So, this proof really starts from what we experience, which means it’s not purely based on logic alone. Because it talks about everything we can experience, or the "world," it’s called the cosmological proof. Unlike other proofs that focus on specific features of the world, this one looks at the world in a general way.

Next, the proof says the necessary being can only be understood in one way — by a single concept that fully describes it. The only concept that can do that is the idea of the “most real being.” So, this means there must be one highest being that exists necessarily.

This cosmological argument uses a lot of tricky ideas, and it seems like deep thinking has tried its hardest to create a very convincing but maybe misleading idea. It relies on the idea that everything that can happen must have a cause, and if those causes keep going back, there has to be a first cause that can’t not exist, or else the whole chain wouldn’t be complete.
