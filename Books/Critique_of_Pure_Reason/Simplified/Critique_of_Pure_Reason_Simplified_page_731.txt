12 For a similar idea, see Kant’s first big paper, “On the form and principles of the sensible and intelligible worlds,” section 29.

13 Kant is talking about Hume’s well-known ideas about cause and effect from his book, Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748). Hume talks about “skeptical doubts” about how we understand cause and effect in section IV, then gives his “skeptical solution” in section V. Later, in section VII, he explains where the idea of “necessary connection” comes from in our minds. Kant’s mention of “cause” and “necessary connection” mainly refers to this last part. Hume’s book was translated into German as early as 1755.

16 Kant’s idea about the difference between math and philosophy goes back to his response to a contest held by the Berlin Academy of Science in 1762. He wrote a paper called Inquiry concerning the distinctness of the principles of natural theology and morality, finished in 1762 and published in 1764. The idea that math statements add new knowledge (synthetic) was also a big topic when Kant debated with Eberhard. 

17 Kant refers to Johann Andreas Segner’s math book, Elementa Arithmeticae, Geometriae et Calculi (1756; second edition 1767), which was translated into German by J. W. Segner as Anfangsgründe der Arithmetik, Geometrie und der geometrischen Berechnung (1764; second edition 1773). Hans Vaihinger points out that Kant used examples from pages 27 and 79 of the 1773 edition; Vaihinger wrote a commentary on Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason in 1881.

18 Another example from Kant’s notes in the early 1780s says: “The radius can be carried over into the circumference 6 times” can’t be figured out just from the idea of the circumference. (The “6 times” is Kant’s rough way of saying 2πr.)

19 Vaihinger argues that some sentences at the end of a paragraph should actually belong to the paragraph before. Kemp Smith agrees and moves them. But since these same sentences appear in the same place in Kant’s Prolegomena, moving them there too would mean Kant left the same mistake twice. Kant made changes quickly for the second edition of the Critique, so it’s possible. Still, the text is left as it was printed, though what follows is probably a comment about all the discussion on math statements, not just the first part of the paragraph.

20 For earlier versions of this idea, see Kant’s notes R 5115 and 5116 from 1776-78.
