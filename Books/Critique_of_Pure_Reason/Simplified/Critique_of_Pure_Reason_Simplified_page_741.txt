The idea that using rules to make judgments would lead to an endless loop is even clearer in Kant’s work called the Critique of Judgment, in the preface.

The first time Kant talks about the idea of schematism is in a note from 1778-79. This makes sense because earlier writings don’t separate the job of explaining how we understand things from the job of explaining how we judge them. Only after Kant split these tasks did he need to create a connection between them. This connection, called "schematism," links the part about understanding concepts to the part about applying principles in judgment. Kant didn’t fully develop this idea until around 1778. He mentions schematism again while working on the first edition of the Critique in 1780-81, and it shows up again in some notes from 1783-84.

Later, Kant says the chapter about schematism is very important, even though his student Jakob Sigismund Beck didn’t understand it.

Kant also makes a difference between just an image and a rule. He does this to respond to critics like Berkeley, who questioned abstract ideas in math. This idea was also mentioned earlier by Leibniz when he talked about Locke’s work.

Kant wrote several notes explaining his ideas about quantity between 1778 and the 1780s.

There are also other notes from 1783-84 that relate to these ideas.

Kant distinguishes between two kinds of judgments: analytic and synthetic. He wrote about this in 1769 and in other reflections from the 1770s.

Some of Kant’s thoughts from the early 1770s also help explain these ideas.

In the Critique of Judgment, Kant talks more about these topics in the introduction.

In one note, Kant says that mathematical principles are called that because they make applied math possible.

Other notes from the mid-1770s give more clarity on these terms.

This distinction is explained well in a note from 1775-77.
