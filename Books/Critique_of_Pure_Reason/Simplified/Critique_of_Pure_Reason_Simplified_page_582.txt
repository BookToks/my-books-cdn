It's impossible to prove that something is real just by thinking about it because you can't know if it's possible without experience. Even if you did have a clear idea, you still couldn't be sure if it really exists. The famous philosopher Leibniz thought he had figured out this kind of proof, but he was wrong.

The famous ontological proof, which tries to prove that a highest being exists just by using ideas, doesn't actually work. It's like a merchant trying to get richer by just adding zeros to his bank account without actually having more money.

In Chapter Three, we learn that it was strange and pointless to try to prove something exists just by using an idea someone made up. People only tried this because they felt they needed to find something that must exist for sure, something necessary, to stop an endless search. They thought they found this in the idea of the most real being, which they believed must exist.

But instead of stopping there, they tried to start with this idea and prove that it must exist, which it couldn’t do. This mistake led to the ontological proof, which doesn’t satisfy anyone, whether a normal thinker or a scholar.

Now, the cosmological proof tries a different approach. It keeps the idea that something absolutely necessary must exist and connects this to the highest reality. Instead of starting from the highest reality to prove it must exist, it tries to start with necessity to explain it.
