Change means that something can be in two opposite states but still be the same thing. How this happens is hard to understand just by thinking about it. You need an example, and even then, it’s easier to understand if you can picture it.

This example is a point moving in space. When a point exists in different places one after another, it helps us understand change. To think about changes inside ourselves, we need to understand time as a line. We imagine this line moving to see how we go through different states. This way, we can understand our changes by seeing them as movements outside ourselves.

But to notice any change, something has to stay the same. Without something lasting, change wouldn’t make sense. This lasting thing doesn’t really exist inside our inner feelings, so we need to look outside to understand change.

Next, understanding how things connect or interact can’t be done by just thinking alone. We need to see it in space. How can one thing’s existence affect another’s if they are completely separate? This idea of things being connected is hard to get if we think of each thing as totally alone.

Leibniz, a philosopher, thought that things only connect because of a higher power, like God, because connection seems impossible if things are completely separate. But we can understand how things might connect if we imagine them in space. Space itself gives conditions for things to affect each other.

Also, the idea of size or amount of things only makes sense if we see them in space first. Then, we can apply this idea to what we feel inside ourselves. To keep things simple, I’ll let you think more about these examples on your own.

This idea is really important, not just for understanding existence but for many other things too.
