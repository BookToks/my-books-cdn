But on the other hand, reason can and should control itself without letting anything else judge it. This control makes reason stronger and more confident because the limits it sets for thinking also stop others from making false claims. This way, reason can protect what it still has left from its earlier, too-big demands. The main use of pure reason’s philosophy is actually negative—it doesn’t help us find new things, but instead helps us know where the limits are. It doesn’t discover truth but quietly helps us avoid mistakes.

Still, there must be some source of true knowledge that comes from pure reason. Sometimes people get confused about it, but this knowledge is the goal of reason’s hard work. Why else would we have such a strong desire to find something solid beyond what we can experience? Pure reason senses that there are important things out there. It tries to get closer by guessing and thinking, but these things keep moving away.

Maybe pure reason will have better luck when it uses itself in a practical way, which is the only choice left.

A canon means the set of basic rules for using our mental abilities correctly. General logic is a canon for understanding and reasoning, but only in terms of how we think, not what we think about.

So, the transcendental analytic is the canon for pure understanding because it alone can create true knowledge before experience. But if we can’t use a mental ability correctly, then there is no canon for it.

Based on what has been proven before, all knowledge that pure reason tries to get just by guessing (without experience) is impossible.
