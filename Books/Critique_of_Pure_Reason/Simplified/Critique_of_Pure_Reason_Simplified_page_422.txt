We can’t really understand or picture an object just by using our reason alone. To truly know something, we need to be able to see or experience it. 

It’s better to say that we can’t really know an object that matches an idea, even if we can think about the idea itself in a confusing or uncertain way.

Pure ideas from reason come from a kind of thinking called a syllogism, which is a logical argument. Sometimes, these arguments don’t use any real-world facts but still try to connect what we know to something unknown. This can trick us into thinking the unknown thing is real.

These tricky arguments aren’t really smart or logical, even if they seem that way. They come from the way our reason works, not from people trying to fool others. Even the smartest people can’t fully avoid these mistakes. They might learn to be careful, but the confusion will always be there, teasing them.

There are only three types of these tricky syllogisms, based on the main ideas they come from. The first type starts with a simple idea of something that isn’t made of many parts and tries to prove it is completely one.
