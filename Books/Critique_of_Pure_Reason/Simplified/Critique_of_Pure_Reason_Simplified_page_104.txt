We wonâ€™t talk about ourselves. Instead, we want people to see what we are doing not just as an idea, but as a real project. It is not made to support any group or just for our own benefit, but to build something useful and important for everyone.

Everyone can think about it for themselves and take part in it for the good of all. Also, people can hope that our work is not something endless or beyond human life. In fact, it aims to stop endless mistakes, which is a fair and proper goal.
