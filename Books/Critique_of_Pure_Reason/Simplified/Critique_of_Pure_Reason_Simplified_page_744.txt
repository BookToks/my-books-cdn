For notes from the 1780s, see R 5710-23 (various dates, 18:332-5), R 5754 and 5757 (1785-89, 18:345), R 5763 (1783-84, 18:347), and R 5772 (1785-89, 18:349)' From the 1780s, see also Metaphysik Volckmann, 28:412-13 and 416-18.
 
 79 For Kant's contrast between non-contradictoriness as the condition of merely logical or "analytical" possibility and the stronger notion of the ob­ jective reality of the concept or real or "synthetic" possibility of the object, see also R 5184 (1776-1780s, 18:II1-I2), R 5556 (1778-81, 18:232), R 5565 (1778-1780s, 18:235), R 5569 (1778-1780s, 18:235-6), R 5572 (1778-1780s, 18:237), and R 5772 (1785-89, 18:349-50).
 
 80 This could appear to be a reference to the existence of an ether as the con­ dition of the possibility of perception which Kant argues for in his Opus postumum, especially in the sections known as Ubergang I-[4 (see 22: 609-15). However, since Kant goes on to say that the possibility of this third thing is entirely groundless because it has no basis in experience while he subsequently argues that the existence of the ether is actually a condition of the possibility of experience, it would seem that he is here considering (and denying) the possibility of a third kind of substance in ad­ dition to matter and mind, rather than the extremely refined form of mat­ ter, which is how he later conceives of the ether.
 
 81 This would appear to be a reference to the Swedenborgian supposition of a world of spirits capable of communicating with each other without the ben­ efit of any material medium that Kant lampooned in the Dreams of a Spirit­ Seer (1766); see 2:329-34, in Theoretical Philosophy, I755-[770, pp. 316-21.

 83 Kant was obviously dissatisfied with this new section of the second edition, for in addition to the modification of the argument already suggested in the preface at B xxxix-xli, numerous sketches of the argument from the years after the publication of the second edition also survive. These in­ clude, from late in 1788, R 5653-4 (18:305-13) and the related R 5655 (18:313-16), and from 1790, apparently written in conjunction with a visit by Kant's disciple]. G. C. Kiesewetter, R 63I I (18:606-I2, in Kiesewetter's hand) and R 630-17 (18:613-29). Other relevant notes include R 5709 (1785-89, 18:332) and R 6323 (1793, 18:641-4, at p. 643). From the period prior to the publication of the first edition of the Critique, two interesting notes are R 5399 and 5400 [1776-78?, 18:172].) 84 Kant already made this distinction between problematic and dogmatic ide­ alism in the later 177os; see Metaphysik L1, 28:206-9.
 
 85 See also R 5661, the draft of an essay entitled "Answer to the question, is it an experience that we think?" (1788-90, 18:318-20).
