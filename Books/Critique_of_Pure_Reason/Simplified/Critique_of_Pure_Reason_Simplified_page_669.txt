All the times people have tried to use pure reason to prove things and failed are important to look at and criticize. But just pointing out mistakes doesn’t settle the debate about what reason can really do. Criticizing alone can’t end the argument about what’s allowed in human thinking.

Hume is maybe the smartest skeptic ever, and he’s the best at showing how skepticism can make us seriously question reason. So it’s worth understanding how he thought, where he got it right, and where even someone as smart as him went off track while searching for the truth.

Hume might have thought, though he never fully explained it, that sometimes we make judgments that go beyond what we understand about something. I call this kind of judgment “synthetic.” It’s easy to see how experience helps us add to what we know by combining what we notice with new things we learn. But we also think we can add to what we know without experience, just by using our mind or pure reason, to understand things that we can’t even experience directly.

Hume didn’t clearly separate these two kinds of judgments, and because of that, he believed that adding to what we know without experience is impossible. He thought all the rules we say are true without experience are actually made up and just habits from what we’ve seen before. So, to him, these rules are not really necessary or universal, but just based on experience.

To support this idea, he used the example of cause and effect. Since our understanding can’t take the idea of one thing and prove another must exist just from that idea, he said we can’t know things a priori (without experience). For example, just knowing what sunlight is doesn’t tell us it will melt wax but harden clay—that has to be learned through experience.

In short, Hume believed that pure reason alone can’t discover laws or truths, only experience can teach us those things.
