Appearances aren’t things by themselves; they are just how we see and understand things inside our minds. When we think about it, even our pure ideas that come before any experience only make sense because they connect different parts of what we imagine into a full picture. This connection happens before we experience anything, and it’s what makes experience possible in the first place.

For example, if I imagine drawing a line or think about the time between one noon and the next, I have to hold one part of that line or time in my mind before moving on to the next part. If I forget the earlier parts every time I think about the next part, I would never be able to see the whole line or understand the entire time passing. Even the most basic ideas about space and time need this kind of connection to make sense.

This process of holding and connecting what we perceive is called the synthesis of apprehension, and it always works together with the process of recalling what we imagined before, called the synthesis of reproduction. Since the first process is the reason we can know anything at all, both from experience and from pure thinking, the second process is also very important. Because of this, we call the ability to connect and recall images in our mind the transcendental faculty of the imagination.

Now, to recognize something, we need to be aware that what we are thinking about now is the same as what we thought about before. Without this awareness, connecting memories in a series wouldn’t help us. Each new image would feel like something totally new and unrelated, so we couldn’t put the pieces together to understand a whole. For example, if I’m counting but forget that the units I’ve counted before are part of the total, I wouldn’t be able to know the full number.
