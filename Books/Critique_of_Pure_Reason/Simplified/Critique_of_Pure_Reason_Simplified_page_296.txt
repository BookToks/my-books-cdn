The system shows all the basic rules about how we understand things we see or experience outside of us. These rules are connected, even if only a little, to what we might experience, or really to the fact that experience is possible. This is why these rules work for understanding things.

Experience is the only way we can really know things for sure. When we think without experience, we only know what is needed to make experience possible in general. The most important rule for all judgments is: Every object follows the necessary rules that make it possible for us to experience it.

So, these special judgments are possible if we link the basic ways we understand and imagine things to the idea of experiencing something. We say: The rules that make experience possible also make objects of experience possible, and that’s why these rules are true even before we experience anything.

The pure understanding is the reason we have these rules at all. It’s not just about following rules for what happens, but it creates the rules that everything must follow to be understood as an object. Without these rules, what we see couldn’t be understood as real objects. Even natural laws, when seen as rules for understanding, show a kind of necessity that exists before any experience.

Kant also notes that we can’t prove these rules just by thinking about concepts alone, as if they were about things by themselves. Instead, we prove them by showing that things can only be perceived in certain ways.
