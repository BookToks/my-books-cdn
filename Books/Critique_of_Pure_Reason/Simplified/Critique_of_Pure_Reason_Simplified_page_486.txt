The proof that the world and the whole series of things go on forever is based on the idea that if they didn’t, there would have to be empty time and empty space at the edge of the world. 

Some people try to avoid this by saying it’s possible for the world to have a boundary in time and space without needing an absolute time before the world started or an absolute space beyond the real world, which can’t exist. I agree with the part that says space is just the way we understand the outside world, not a real thing we can actually see or touch. Space isn’t something that exists on its own but is the way things appear to us.

Because space isn’t a real object by itself, it can’t decide if things are real or not. Instead, things that appear to us make space real in a certain way, like giving it size and shape. Space alone can’t decide how big or what shape things are because it isn’t real by itself.

Space and appearances are connected in one experience, like how matter and shape go together. If you try to think of space without any appearances, it would create ideas that can’t really be seen or experienced. For example, thinking about the world moving or resting in endless empty space is just an idea that we can’t actually observe, so it’s only a thought, not something real.
