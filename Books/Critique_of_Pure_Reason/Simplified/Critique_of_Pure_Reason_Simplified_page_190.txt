Space is basically the way we see and understand everything outside of us. It’s how our minds organize what we sense around us. Before we even notice things, our mind is already set up to understand space. This means we can think about space and how things relate to each other even before we actually see or experience them.

We can only talk about space and objects like it from a human point of view. If we stop thinking about how we sense things, space doesn’t really mean anything. Space only describes things the way they appear to us through our senses. Our ability to sense things is what lets us understand objects as being outside of us. If we ignore the objects, space is just a pure way of seeing things.

We can’t say that space is a rule for how things really are by themselves, only how they appear to us. We don’t know if other beings see space the same way we do. If we say, “All things are next to each other in space,” this is true only if we mean things as we see them through our senses. So, space is real when it comes to what we can experience, but it’s more of an idea when we think about things on their own, without our senses.

So, space is real for everything we can experience outside us, but it’s just an idea when we think about things without considering how we sense them. Besides space, there isn’t any other way that our minds organize what we sense.
