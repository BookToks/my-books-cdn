A complete system of all the rules for putting ideas together must fit the general way we experience things. This general way, which is how we experience anything at all, includes all the combining that’s needed for us to understand objects.

If a concept has a combination of ideas inside it, but this combination doesn’t come from experience, then the concept is empty and doesn’t relate to any real object. The combination either comes from experience itself (making it an empirical concept) or it is a basic rule that experience depends on, making it a pure concept. Even pure concepts are connected to experience because their objects can only be found through experience.

Where else would we get the idea that an object is possible except from the way we combine things in experience? It’s true that a concept can’t have any contradictions if it’s going to make sense logically, but that alone doesn’t prove the concept is real or that the object it describes can exist.

For example, the idea of a shape formed by two straight lines intersecting makes sense and has no contradictions. But whether that shape can actually be made depends on the rules of space and how space works. These rules are real because they are part of how we experience things before we even look at them.

Now, think about this: If I imagine something that lasts over time, with all changes just being its different states, I can’t know if such a thing is really possible just from the idea alone. Or, if I imagine something that always causes something else to happen after it, I can think about it without contradictions, but I can’t say for sure if this kind of cause-and-effect actually happens in real things.

I can also imagine different things that affect each other’s states, but again, just thinking about these ideas doesn’t prove they exist. Only because these ideas match the way our experiences always happen can we know they are truly real and true—not just based on experience itself, but based on the basic way experience is shaped.
