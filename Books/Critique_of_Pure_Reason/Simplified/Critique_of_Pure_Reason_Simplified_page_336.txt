Systematic representation of all synthetic principles cept agree with the formal conditions of an experience in general. This, however, namely the objective form of experience in general, contains all synthesis that is requisite for the cognition of objects.a A concept that in­ cludes a synthesis in it is to be held as empty, and does not relate to any object, if this synthesis does not belong to experience, either as borrowed from it, in which case it is an empirical concept, or as one on which, as priori condition, experience in general (its form) rests, and then it is a a pure concept, which nevertheless belongs to experience, since its objectb can be encountered only in the latter. For whence will one derive the character of the possibility of an object that is thought by means of a syn­ thetic priori concept, if not from the synthesis that constitutes the form a of the empirical cognition of objects?' That in such a concept no contradiction must be contained is, to be sure, a necessary logical condition; but B 268 it is far from sufficient for the objective reality of the concept, i.e., for the possibility of such an object as is thought through the concept,79 Thus in the concept of a figure that is enclosed between two straight lines there is no contradiction, for the concepts of two straight lines and their intersection contain no negation of a figure; rather the impossibility rests not A22I on the concept in itself, but on its construction in space, i.e., on the conditions of space and its determinations; but these in turn have their objective reality, i.e., they pertain to possible things, because they contain in themselves priori the form of experience in general.
 
 a We shall now make obvious the extensive utility and influence of this postulate of possibility. If I represent to myself a thing that persists, so that everything that changes merely belongs to its states, I can never cognize from such a concept alone that such a thing is possible. Or, if I represent something to myself that is so constituted that if it is posited something else always and inevitably succeeds it, this may well be able to be so thought without contradiction; but whether such a property (as causality) will be encountered in any possible thing cannot thereby be judged. Finally, I can represent various things (sub- B 269 stances) to myself that are so constituted that the state of one is followed by a consequence in the state of the other, and conversely; but whether such a relation can pertain to any things cannot be derived from these concepts, which contain a merely arbitrary synthesis. Thus only from the fact that these concepts express priori the relations of a the perceptions in every experience does one cognize their objective reality, i.e., their transcendental truth, and, to be sure, independently A222 of experience, but yet not independently of all relationd to the form of a Objecte Object b , Objecte Beziehung d 323 Doctrine of Elements.
