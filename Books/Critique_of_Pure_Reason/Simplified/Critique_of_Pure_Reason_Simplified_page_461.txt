This argument is wrong because it tricks you with the way words are used.

If you look closely at how ideas work, especially the idea of a "thing" that can exist by itself and not just as a description, you’ll see that this idea doesn’t actually mean anything real. We can’t know if it applies to anything because we don’t understand how something like that could actually exist. So, this idea doesn’t give us any real knowledge.

For the idea of "substance" (a thing that exists on its own) to be real, it needs to be based on something we can actually experience that lasts over time. But inside our minds, there’s nothing that lasts like that. The "I" is just being aware of my own thoughts. If we only think about thinking, we don’t have what we need to say the "I" is a substance that exists by itself. So, the clear idea of substance disappears and turns into just a simple awareness of thinking, no matter if the person is simple or made up of many parts.

The word "thinking" is used in two different ways in the argument: in the first part, it means thinking about objects that exist and can be experienced; in the second part, it means just the act of thinking itself, without thinking about any object. So, the first part talks about things that must be subjects, but the second part only talks about thinking related to yourself without any object.

Because of this, the conclusion that "I can only exist as a subject" is wrong. Instead, it just means that when I think about myself, I only use myself as the subject of my thoughts. This is a true but obvious point and doesn’t tell us anything real about how I actually exist.
