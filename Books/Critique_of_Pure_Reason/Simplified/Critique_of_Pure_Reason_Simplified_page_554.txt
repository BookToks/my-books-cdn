When I want to do something, there might be many things around me or feelings that push me to want it. But these things don’t tell me what I should do. They only make me want something, and that wanting isn’t always necessary or certain. Reason, or my thinking, sets a standard and a goal for what I should do. It can say yes or no to what I want.

Whether something feels nice or seems good in my head, reason doesn’t just follow what I feel or see. Instead, it makes its own rules based on ideas. Reason fits what I experience into these rules and can even say that some actions must happen, even if they haven’t happened yet or might never happen. Reason expects that it can cause things to happen in real life because of these ideas.

Now, let’s think about if reason really can cause things to happen in what we see. If it can, then reason must have a kind of “real-world” side, because every cause has a rule that says certain effects will follow. These rules need to be consistent. Since we only see appearances, this “real-world” side of reason is something we can call its “empirical character.” This stays the same, even though its results might look different depending on different situations.

So, every person has this “empirical character” in how they choose what to do. This is like the power of reason working in a certain way. We can understand these choices by looking at patterns and rules in what people do. Because this “empirical character” is based on what we observe, all human actions seem to follow natural order and causes. If we knew everything about a person’s choices and the conditions around them, we could predict exactly what they would do. For this “empirical character,” there is no freedom, and people can be seen just as part of nature following rules.
