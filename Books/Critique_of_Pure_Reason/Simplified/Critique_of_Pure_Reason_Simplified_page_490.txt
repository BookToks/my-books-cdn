Imagine something made up of smaller simple parts.

Since everything that connects substances happens in space, there must be as many parts of space as there are parts of the thing taking up that space.

But space itself isn’t made of simple parts; it’s made of areas of space. So, every part of the thing must take up some space. The most basic parts are simple, so these simple parts take up space.

Now, anything real that takes up space is made of different parts that are separate from each other, so it’s made of multiple parts. And since it’s a real thing made of parts, it’s made of substances, not just qualities. So, if the simple were real, it would actually be made of parts, which doesn’t make sense.

The second idea says that nothing simple exists in the world. This means we can’t prove the simple exists by any experience or perception, inside or outside ourselves. The simple is just an idea, and we can’t find real examples of it in the world. If it did exist, we would be able to sense something without any parts at all, but we never do. Just because we don’t notice such a thing doesn’t mean it’s impossible.
