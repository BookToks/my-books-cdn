19 Richard Rorty used this phrase in a famous criticism of the way people understood human knowledge before Kant. He wrote about this in his book Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (Princeton University Press, 1979).

21 In Prolegomena, page 260, Lewis White Beck guessed that Kant’s “recollection” of Hume happened in 1772. This means Kant had read Hume before but only fully realized his importance then. Beck explains this in his edition of the Prolegomena (Bobbs-Merrill, 1950) and in Early German Philosophy: Kant and His Predecessors (Harvard University Press, 1969), page 457. Kant also wrote in a note in his own copy of Baumgarten’s Metaphysica that “The year ’69 gave me great light.” This suggests Kant’s big change in thinking started in 1769 and finished around 1772. People have talked a lot about how Kant’s ideas changed during those years. We will look at some of these ideas later.

22 Some of Kant’s later writings were edited by Eckart Forster and translated by Forster and Michael Rosen in Immanuel Kant, Opus postumum (Cambridge University Press, 1993).

23 This phrase comes from Leibniz’s essay “The Principles of Nature and Grace, based on Reason,” written in 1714 and published after his death in 1718. When thinking about how Leibniz influenced people in the 1700s, it’s important to know that he was mostly known for his Theodicy (1710), “The Principles of Nature and Grace,” and the “Monadology” (published in 1720), along with his letters with Clarke (1717). So, during his time and early in Kant’s life, Leibniz was famous for his ideas about how tiny things called monads work together perfectly and for arguing with Newton’s ideas about space and time. Leibniz’s long commentary on Locke’s Essay concerning Human Understanding, called the New Essays, wasn’t published until 1765. Even though Kant became interested in it, it didn’t change how Kant saw Leibniz or his influence on him.
