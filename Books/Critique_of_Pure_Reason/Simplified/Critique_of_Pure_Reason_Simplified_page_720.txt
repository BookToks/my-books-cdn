 2 I Prolegomena, 4:260. Lewis White Beck has conjectured that this "recollec­ tion" of Hume -a recollection because Kant had read Hume before this time but not previously felt his full impact -must have occurred in 1772 (see his edition of the Prolegomena [Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1950], p.
 
 8n., and his Early German Philosophy: Kanta nd His Predecessors [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1969], p. 457). In a note in his own copy of his classroom metaphysics text, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten's Meta­ physica, which has been widely cited for at least a century, Kant also wrote that "The year '69 gave me great light" (R 5037, 18:68). This remark sug­ gests that Kant's intellectual revolution may have begun in 1769 and only culminated in 1772. There has been much discussion about just how Kant's thought changed during those years (see Lothar Kreimendahl, Kant -Der Durchbruch von 1769 [Cologne: jUrgen Dinter Verlag, 1990]). We will re­ turn to some of the issues involved below.

 23 This phrase is borrowed from the title of Leibniz's essay "The Principles ofN ature and Grace, based on Reason," written in 1714 and posthumously published in 1718. When considering the influence of Leibniz on his con­ temporaries and on most of the eighteenth century, it must be kept in mind that he was not known by the works that have been most influential in the twentieth century, the "Discourse on Metaphysics" and other writings from the period around 1686, but was instead known almost exclusively by the Theodicy of 1710, "The Principles of Nature and Grace," and the con­ temporary "Monadology" (first published in 1720), and by the posthu­ mously published Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence (1717). Thus what Leibniz was best known for in his own time and through the first half of Kant's life was his vision of the preestablished harmony of the monads on the one hand and his dispute with the Newtonians about the nature of space and time on the other. The New Essays concerning Human Understanding, Leib­ niz's lengthy commentary on Locke's Essay concerning Human Understand­ ing, was left unpublished when Locke died in 1704 and not published until 1765. Although it then certainly became of great interest to Kant, it did not change Kant's fundamental image of Leibniz or the basic character of Leibniz's lasting influence on Kant.
