First, it’s important to say that math statements are always known without needing experience, because they are definitely true and you can’t figure them out just by looking at the world. But if someone doesn’t agree, I’ll just talk about pure math, which means it’s based on ideas alone, not on what we see or touch.

You might think the statement "7 + 5 = 12" is just true because of the meaning of the numbers seven and five. But if you think more carefully, the idea of adding 7 and 5 only means putting them together as one group. It doesn’t tell you what the actual total is. Just knowing “7 and 5 combined” doesn’t automatically mean 12. No matter how much you think about it, you won’t find the number 12 in that idea alone.

To really understand why 7 plus 5 equals 12, you need to use your intuition. For example, you can use your five fingers or dots to help see what’s happening. If you start with 7, then add 5 more fingers one by one, you can see the total number grow and reach 12. You already thought about adding 7 and 5, but you didn’t think that the answer would be 12. 

So, math statements like this always teach you something new. You realize this more clearly when working with bigger numbers because, no matter how you think about the numbers, you can’t find their sum just by thinking. You need to imagine or feel it to know the total.
