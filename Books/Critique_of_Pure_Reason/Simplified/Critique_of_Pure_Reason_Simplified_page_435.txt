If we compare thinking not with physical stuff but with the deeper reality behind what we see as matter, then since we don’t really know anything about that deeper reality, we can’t say the soul is really different from it inside.

So, being simply aware doesn’t mean we truly understand what our mind is, especially if we think it’s different from matter, which is made up of many parts.

If this idea still doesn’t clearly explain what makes our mind special, even when we compare ourselves to things outside us, some people might still say the thinking self, or soul, is simple. But this idea doesn’t actually help us understand anything real, so it doesn’t add to our knowledge.

Because of this, the whole idea of rational psychology falls apart, along with its main ideas. We can’t really learn more just by thinking about concepts that don’t connect to real experiences, especially since the idea of something being absolutely simple is something we’ve never actually experienced and can’t prove as a real concept.

The third mistake about personality says: if someone is aware that they are the same person over time, then they are a person.

The soul is supposed to be that, so it must be a person.

But when we try to understand how we know something outside ourselves stays the same over time, we pay attention to what stays constant even though other things change. I’m an object of inner awareness, and time is just how I experience things inside. So, I connect all my changing experiences to one same self through time.
