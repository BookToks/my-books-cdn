The opposite idea of pure reason (whether it has meaning or not) can be limited by what we see, but what we see can’t be limited by empty space outside of it. The same is true for time. Even though this is accepted, it’s clear that if we think the world has an edge in space or time, we have to imagine empty space outside the world and empty time before it.

Some people try to avoid this by saying that if the world has limits, then the endless empty space would decide how big things are. But this is like imagining some kind of invisible world instead of the world we actually experience. Instead of thinking about a beginning with nothing before it, they think about existence without any starting point, ignoring the edges of the world and time.

But here, we’re only talking about the world we experience and how big it is. You can’t ignore how we sense things without losing the world itself. If the world we see has limits, it has to be inside endless empty space. If you try to leave out empty space, you leave out space in general, which means you leave out the whole world we experience. But this world of experience is all we really have. The idea of a world we don’t sense is just a general idea without any real proof or details.

It’s easy to see that empty space inside the world doesn’t go against the basic rules of knowledge and can be accepted, even if we don’t directly prove it.
