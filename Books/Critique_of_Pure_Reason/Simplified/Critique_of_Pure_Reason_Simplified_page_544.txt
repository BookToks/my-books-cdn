On the empirical use of the regulative principle sumed to be a first, and hence unconditioned member. Thus it would not always be the object,tT i.e., the conditioned, but the series of conditions for it, which was so considered merely in its magnitude; and then A 5291 B 557 the difficulty -which could not be removed by any compromise, but only by completely cutting the knot -consisted in the fact that reason made it either too long or too short for the understanding, so that the understanding could never come out equal to reason's idea.
 
 But in this we have overlooked an essential distinction governing the objects/ i.e., among the concepts of the understanding which reason as­ pires to raise to ideas, namely, that according to our table of categories two of them signifY mathematical, but the other two a dynamical syn­ thesis of appearances. Until now this was all right, since just as in the general representation of all transcendental ideas we always stayed only within appearance, so in the two mathematical-transcendental ideas we had no object other than one in appearance. Now, however, that we are progressing to dynamical concepts of the understanding, insofar as they are to be suited to the idea of reason, this distinction comes to be important, and opens up for us an entirely new prospect in regard to the suit in which reason has become implicated; whereas up to now it has been dismissed as based on false presuppositions on both sides, now perhaps in the dynamical antinomy there is a presupposition that can ABo/B 558 coexist with the pretensions of reason, and since the judge may make good the defects in legal grounds that have been misconstrued on both sides, the case can be mediated to the satisfaction of both parties, which could not be done in the controversy about the mathematical antinomy.
 
 The series of conditions are obviously all homogeneous to the extent that one looks solely at how far they reach: whether they conform to the idea, or are too big or too small for it. Yet the concept of under­ standing grounding these ideas contains either solely a synthesis of homogeneous things (which is presupposed in the case of every mag­ nitude, in its composition as well as its division), or else a synthesis of things not homogeneous, which must be at least admitted in the case of the dynamical synthesis, in causal connection as well as in the con­ nection of the necessary with the contingent.
 
 Hence it is that in the mathematical connection of series of appear­ ances, none other than a sensible condition can enter, i.e., only one that is itself a part of the series; whereas the dynamic series of sensible conditions, on the contrary, allows a further condition different in kind, one that is not a part of the series but, as merely intelligible, lies outside the series; in this way reason can be given satisfaction and the un- A 5 3 IIB 559 conditioned can be posited prior to appearances without confounding Object n b Objecte 531 Doctrine of Elements.
