When we use reason to think about the first cause or starting point of something, we often assume it’s the very first, without any conditions before it. But sometimes, instead of focusing on the final thing, we look at all the conditions leading up to it as a whole. The problem is that reason either makes this chain of conditions too long or too short for our understanding. So, our understanding can never fully match what reason imagines.

However, we missed an important difference in the kinds of ideas our understanding tries to turn into full concepts. According to a certain system, some ideas are about math, while others are about how things change and affect each other. Until now, this was okay because we only thought about ideas based on what we can experience. But now, as we move to ideas about how things cause and affect each other, this difference becomes very important. It shows us a new way to solve the problem. Before, reason’s ideas seemed impossible, but maybe with these cause-and-effect ideas, there’s a way they can work together. Like a judge fixing a case where both sides made mistakes, the problem might be solved so everyone is happy, unlike the math problem where no solution was possible.

When we look at the chain of conditions, they’re all similar if we only think about how far they go—whether they fit the idea or are too big or too small. But the understanding either mixes things that are all the same kind (like parts of a whole) or mixes different kinds of things. We have to accept that cause-and-effect ideas mix different kinds, like things that must happen and things that might happen.

So, in math, every condition has to come from what we can sense, meaning it’s part of the chain we see. But in cause-and-effect ideas, there can be a condition that’s different—it’s not part of what we sense but exists in our understanding. This way, reason can be satisfied because we can think of an unconditioned cause that exists before what we experience, without getting confused.
