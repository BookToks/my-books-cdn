6 But what I mean here is not a review of books or ideas, but a review of the ability to reason itself. This means looking at all the knowledge that reason can reach on its own, without depending on any experience. It’s about deciding whether metaphysics (the study of things beyond the physical world) is possible at all, figuring out where it comes from, and understanding its limits—all based on basic principles.

This is the only way left to explore, and I believe I have succeeded in clearing up all the mistakes that have made reason argue with itself when it tries to work without experience. I didn’t ignore reason’s big questions by saying humans can’t understand them. Instead, I clearly defined these questions based on principles, found where reason got confused, and solved these problems in a way that satisfies reason completely.

Of course, the answers I found aren’t as exciting as some people might have hoped. Those who want magical or unbelievable knowledge won’t like this, but that’s not what reason is naturally meant to do. Philosophy’s job is to get rid of false ideas, even if it means destroying some popular and comforting beliefs.

In this work, I aimed to be as complete as possible, and I’m confident there isn’t a single metaphysical problem that hasn’t been solved here or at least given a clue on how to solve it. Pure reason is so perfectly connected that if its principles couldn’t answer even one question, then everything else it claims would be doubtful.

Religions, because of their sacredness, and laws, because of their power, often try to stay outside of reason’s judgment. But this just makes people suspicious of them. True respect from reason only comes to those ideas that can stand up to open and honest questioning.
