If I hadn’t put my senses together one after another, I wouldn’t understand how many things there are by adding them up. So, I wouldn’t know the number because the idea of number comes from being aware of this joining together.

The word "concept" helps explain this. It means one awareness that brings together many different things we see or imagine into one single idea.

Sometimes this awareness is very weak, so we only notice it after we form the idea, not while we’re doing it. But no matter how clear it is, there must always be some awareness. Without that, we couldn’t have concepts or understand anything.

Now, let’s talk about what "an object of representations" means. We said before that what we see or sense are just images in our mind, not things outside of us. So, what do we mean by an object that matches what we know but is different from it? It’s something general, called X, because outside our thoughts, we don’t have anything else to compare with our ideas.

Our thinking about how all knowledge relates to its object says that the object must be real and not just random. Our ideas about it have to agree with each other and be connected in a way that makes the object a single thing. But since we only have our images, and X is supposed to be different from all of them, it’s nothing we can really know. So, the unity the object requires is just the unity in our mind when we put our ideas together.

We say we know the object when we combine many ideas into one. But this can’t happen unless the way we combine these ideas follows a rule that makes putting them together necessary and possible. For example, when we think of a triangle...
