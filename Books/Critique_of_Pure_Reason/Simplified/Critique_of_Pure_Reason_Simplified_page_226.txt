Here is a list of all the basic pure ideas that the mind already has before it learns anything. These ideas let the mind understand things clearly, without any outside help. Only with these ideas can the mind think about objects it senses. This list comes from one main idea: the ability to judge, which is the same as the ability to think. It wasn’t made by randomly guessing pure ideas, which would never be sure or complete.

Aristotle tried to find these basic ideas a long time ago. He was smart, but he didn’t have a clear system. So, he just gathered ideas he found and made a list of ten called categories. Later, he added five more called post-predicaments. But his list wasn’t perfect. It mixed in ideas about space and time, which don’t belong in these basic concepts. It also included some ideas based on experience and left out some important ones.

To understand the main ideas better, we need to know that these categories are the true basic ideas of pure understanding. They also have related ideas that come from them, which are important but less basic. These related ideas shouldn’t be ignored if we want a complete system, but I will only mention them briefly here.

I will call these related but less basic ideas the “predicables” of pure understanding, to set them apart from the main categories. Once you have the original basic ideas, you can easily add the related ones, showing the full “family tree” of pure understanding. Here, I am focusing only on the main ideas.
