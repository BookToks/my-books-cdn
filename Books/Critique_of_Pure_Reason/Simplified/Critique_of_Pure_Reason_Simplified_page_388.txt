Even if we could say something definite about things as they really are by using pure understanding (which we can’t), this wouldn’t connect to how things appear to us, because appearances don’t show things as they really are. So, I always have to think about my ideas only based on how we sense things, meaning space and time describe appearances, not the things themselves. What things really are, I don’t know and don’t need to know, since things only show up to me as appearances. I use the same way of thinking for other ideas too.

Matter is just what appears to us. What it’s like inside, I try to find out by looking at all the space it takes up and what it does, which are always just appearances we sense from outside. So, I only have things that are internal compared to other things, which are really just about outside relations. The idea of something absolutely internal in matter, according to pure understanding, is just made up because it’s never something we can actually know. The real thing behind the appearances we call matter is just some “something” that we wouldn’t understand even if someone explained it.

If people complain that “we don’t understand what things are really like inside,” that doesn’t make sense. It would mean we could know things without using our senses, which would mean we have a kind of knowledge totally different from humans. That would make us beings that we can’t even imagine. By studying appearances carefully, we get closer to understanding nature’s insides, and maybe we’ll learn more over time. But questions that go beyond nature, we’ll never answer, even if we learn everything about nature, because that kind of thing is never part of the stuff we experience.
