If each thing were completely alone, with no effect on any other and no influence coming back to it, then you wouldn’t be able to tell if they happened at the same time. Also, the fact that one exists wouldn’t prove the other exists in any way you could experience. If you thought they were separated by empty space, then noticing one after the other would show the second exists, but you couldn’t tell if it really came after or was happening at the same time.

So, there has to be more than just their existence. There has to be something that lets one thing decide the time of the other, and the other thing do the same for the first. Only then can we say they exist at the same time based on what we experience. What decides the time of another thing is a cause or effect. This means each thing must have some connection to the cause and effect in the other. They have to be linked and affecting each other, directly or indirectly, for us to understand their happening at the same time. This connection is needed for us to even experience these things.

The word “community” can mean different things. Here, it means “commerce” or interaction, not just being part of the same group. Without this kind of connection, we couldn’t even understand things being next to each other in space. From what we experience, only ongoing influence across space lets us notice one thing after another. For example, the light from stars reaching our eyes creates a kind of connection that shows they exist at the same time as us. We can’t notice a change in one place without something else reacting, and this gives us a way to know different things exist together, even if far apart. Without this connection, no one would be able to prove things happen at the same time or exist together.
