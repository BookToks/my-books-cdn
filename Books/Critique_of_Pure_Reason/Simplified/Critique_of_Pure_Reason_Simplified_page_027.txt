Kant’s idea is about how we use big ideas in science and morals. He first talks about this in the last part of "Transcendental Dialectic" and explains it more in the "Critique of Judgment." He also talks about how pure reason helps us understand the basics of right and wrong, especially in the "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals" and the "Critique of Practical Reason."

Before Kant, the way people studied philosophy was divided into four parts: being (ontology), mind (psychology), the universe (cosmology), and God (theology). Kant replaced the old way of thinking about being with his own ideas in the "Transcendental Aesthetic" and "Analytic." But in the "Transcendental Dialectic," he shows that the other three parts—psychology, cosmology, and theology—are not real sciences. They come from human reason trying to go beyond what we can actually experience.

Kant explains that people try to find things that are absolute or unlimited. For example, they think about the soul as a simple, non-physical thing. Or they try to find the very first event in time or the edge of space. They also come up with the idea of God as the ultimate being behind everything. Kant thinks these ideas are illusions that seem natural but are not real science.

Instead, Kant says we should stick to what we can experience. Psychology should be based on real observations about humans, which he called "anthropology." Cosmology should be about the basics of science, like motion. And theology should focus on morals, where ideas like God, freedom, and immortality are seen as necessary for morality, not as proven facts.

The first part of the "Transcendental Dialectic" tries to explain and defend these big ideas, like the soul, free will, and God, which traditional philosophy has always focused on.
