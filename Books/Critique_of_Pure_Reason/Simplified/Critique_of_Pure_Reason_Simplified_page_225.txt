There are special ideas called pure concepts of understanding. These help us connect different things we see or experience in our minds. We call them "pure" because they work before we even have any specific experience. Normal logic can’t do this on its own.

There are exactly as many of these pure concepts as there are ways to put ideas together in judgments. The understanding uses all of these in a complete and measured way. Following the old philosopher Aristotle, we call these pure concepts "categories." Our goal is similar to his, even though we do it in a different way.

There are different types of categories:

1. Quantity: Unity (one), Plurality (many), Totality (all).

2. Quality: Reality (what is), Negation (what is not), Limitation (how much).

3. Relation: Inherence and Subsistence (how things belong together), Causality and Dependence (cause and effect), Community (interaction between things).

4. Modality: Possibility and Impossibility, Existence and Non-existence, Necessity and Contingency (what must or might happen).

In Kant’s notes, he says logical functions are just ways to connect ideas when we think. Categories, however, are ideas that shape how we understand what we experience. For example, categories help us figure out what should be seen as the main subject, not just a description.

He also talks about how categories work in organizing knowledge, and how different kinds of ideas—those from thinking, from experience, or from pure senses—relate to each other.
