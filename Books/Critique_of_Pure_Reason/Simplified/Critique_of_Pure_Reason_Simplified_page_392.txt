When we understand something, it’s not just about the basic idea or concept of a thing. There’s also the way we see or feel it, which gives us a kind of space where everything relates to each other. This space and those relationships can’t be fully known just by thinking about concepts. So, even though you can’t think of something inside without also thinking of something outside, the outside world depends on what’s inside the things themselves that we understand through these ideas and experiences.

If we ignore how we experience things, then the only thing left in a concept is the idea of something inside, and how that inside connects to the outside. But this is just because we are ignoring how things actually appear to us. When we actually see or feel things, they show us relationships or connections that don’t really have an “inside” by themselves. These are just how things look or seem to us, not what they actually are. And when we look at these connections, some of them are strong and lasting, which helps us recognize specific objects.

If I ignore these connections, I can’t think of anything more about the thing itself. That doesn’t mean the idea of something appearing is wrong, or that we can’t think about an object in general. But it does mean we can’t think about an object only by using ideas alone, without experience. It’s strange to think a thing is made only of relationships, but such a thing is just how it appears to us, not the real thing itself. We can’t understand it just by using pure ideas because it exists only as a connection between something and our senses. 

Also, if you start only with ideas without any experience, the only way to think about how things relate is by thinking one thing causes changes in another. That’s how we usually understand relationships. But if we ignore experience, we miss out on the way things fit in space, which comes before any cause-and-effect we observe.

If we mean by “intelligible objects” the things we understand only through pure ideas without any experience, then those things can’t exist. That’s because to use our understanding properly, we need to experience things first. Our concepts only work when they connect to how we sense the world.
