When Epicurus talked about "systematic representation of all synthetic principles," he meant a clear way to explain how we understand things. But there’s something about what we sense that we can’t know before we actually experience it. This is the main difference between what we know from experience and what we can figure out just by thinking.

For example, when we think about space and time or shapes and sizes, we can predict these things before seeing them because they are always the same. But we can’t predict exactly how every feeling or sensation will be before we actually feel it. It’s weird to try to guess what a feeling will be like before experiencing it, since feelings come from experience.

Sensation only lasts for a moment. When we feel something, it’s just a quick instant unless we have many sensations one after another. Because of this, a single feeling doesn’t have a size or amount that we can measure easily. If we don’t feel anything at that moment, it’s like there’s nothing there.

Every feeling can get weaker and weaker until it disappears completely. So, between feeling something and feeling nothing, there are many small steps where the feeling gradually changes. These small differences are much less than the difference between feeling something and feeling nothing at all.

The real thing we feel has a kind of size, but it’s not a size we can measure easily like length or width. Instead, it’s what we call "intensive magnitude," which means it’s felt as one whole thing. The amount of feeling can only be understood by how strong or weak it is, not by parts or pieces.

When we think of this feeling as a cause of something, like gravity causing objects to fall, the amount of feeling or force is called a "moment." This moment is about how strong the feeling is right at that instant, not something that happens step by step.

So, every feeling or reality we experience has this kind of intensity or degree, even if it doesn’t take up any space or last for a long time.
