Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter II

We can accept the idea of a “transcendental object” — something beyond what we can really know. But thinking about it as a real thing with specific features doesn’t make sense, because it’s not based on any experience or proof. So, it’s just an idea we imagine.

Still, some big ideas in philosophy, like the “fourth antinomy,” push us to take a risk and think this way. Since everything we see depends on something else, we have to imagine something different from all appearances — an “intelligible object” that stops this endless chain.

If we allow ourselves to believe in something real that exists outside what we can sense, then appearances are just random ways that smart beings represent these objects. Because of this, the best we can do is use ideas from experience to try to understand things we actually can’t know directly.

We can only learn about things that happen by experiencing them, but here we’re dealing with things that can’t be experienced at all. So, we have to understand them through what must be true by itself, using pure ideas about things in general.

Taking this first step beyond what we can sense means we have to start by studying a being that must exist no matter what. From this, we can try to figure out ideas about all things that can only be understood by the mind. We will start this study in the next chapter.
