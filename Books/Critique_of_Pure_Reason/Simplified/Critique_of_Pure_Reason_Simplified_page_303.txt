The main idea is this: Every time we see or feel something, the real thing behind that sensation has a certain intensity or strength.

Perception means being aware of something through our senses. When we perceive something, it’s not just a simple picture like space or time. Instead, it includes some real stuff that affects us and that we think of as an object.

Sometimes, our awareness changes from just sensing something to understanding it more clearly in space and time. This means we can measure how strong a sensation is, even if the sensation itself isn’t something we can see or touch directly.

Sensation doesn’t have a size like a shape does, but it does have an intensity, like how strong a feeling or a sense is. So, whenever we perceive something through our senses, it has a level of intensity or effect on us.

Basically, we can think of any knowledge that helps us understand what we will experience before it happens as an “anticipation.”
