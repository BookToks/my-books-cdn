When we think about ourselves, it changes how we understand the mind in a way that makes it more about real experiences.

This idea is the main part of understanding the mind, and from it, we can learn everything else. If this thought is about me, it can only include certain special features that don’t come from experience. Adding anything from experience would ruin the pure idea of the science.

Here, we just follow certain rules. Since the first thing we get is “I” as a thinking being, we start with the idea of something that exists on its own, called substance. Then we go backward through the list of ideas. The main points about the mind, from which everything else comes, are these:

1. The soul is a substance.  
2. It has qualities.  
3. It is always the same over time, meaning it’s one and not many.  
4. It is connected to things that might exist in space.

If this sounds confusing because of the abstract words, don’t worry. Later, there will be better explanations. Also, the Latin words used here might make it harder to understand, but the writer prefers clear meaning over fancy language.

A note from Kant himself says the soul is an idea that isn’t based on experience but is a basic part of thinking. Later, he changed this to say, “The soul exists as substance.”
