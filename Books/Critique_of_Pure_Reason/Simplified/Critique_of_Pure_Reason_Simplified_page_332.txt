Every time we see something, our mind connects it to what we saw before. If it didn’t, then every new thing we see would feel totally separate, and we wouldn’t understand how things relate to each other over time. I’m not saying empty space doesn’t exist—it might be there where we can’t see or sense anything—but if we can’t experience it, it’s not really an object for us.

Here’s a way to understand it better. All the things we see and experience have to be linked in our mind. When objects seem to exist at the same time, they help us figure out where they are in relation to each other, so everything makes sense as a whole.

For this to happen in real life, the way we see one thing has to allow us to see another thing too. This means objects influence each other, so even though we notice them one after the other, we can still think of them as happening at the same time. This influence is like a real connection between things, and without it, we couldn’t say that things exist at the same time in our experience.

Because of this connection, objects that are separate but linked make a bigger whole. This kind of combination can happen in different ways. There are three main ways things can be connected: how one thing belongs to another, how one thing causes another, and how things come together to form a whole.

These three ways explain how we understand things existing in time. Time shows itself as how long something lasts, the order in which things happen, and how things exist together at once. Time is active and changing, not just a container where things happen.
