Part II, Division II, Book II

Someone doesn’t need to know more about something or pretend to know more to show that a claim has no real basis. This doesn’t mean the claim is wrong, just that it’s unsupported. A skeptical argument puts a statement and its opposite side by side, treating both as equally possible. Each side acts like a strong opinion against the other, so they both seem certain just to cancel out any real judgment about the thing.

Both the strong opinion side and the skeptical side need to believe they understand the thing well enough to say something about it, whether yes or no. But the critical argument is different — it shows a theory is wrong by pointing out that it assumes something useless or made-up. It doesn’t try to decide what the thing really is, just that the theory’s foundation is shaky.

Now, based on how we usually think about the world outside us, we tend to believe those things are real and exist on their own, separate from us. This idea is called transcendental dualism. It means that the things we sense are outside of us, not just ideas in our mind, and they are totally separate from our thinking self. This mistake is the base of all the ideas about how the mind and body work together. No one really asks if this idea that things exist outside us exactly as we think is right — they just assume it’s true. The arguments only focus on how to explain or understand this.

There are three main ideas about how the mind and body connect. These are the only real options: physical influence, preestablished harmony, and supernatural help. The last two ideas came up because people didn’t agree with the first one — the common idea. They argued that what we see as matter can’t directly cause our thoughts or feelings because those are totally different kinds of things.

But they don’t realize that what we think of as the outside world is just an appearance — a kind of idea caused by something else. If they did, they would see that it makes no sense to say these appearances can’t cause our thoughts, since appearances themselves are just mental representations. That objection doesn’t hold up.
