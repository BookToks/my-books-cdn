The first chapter, called the "Discipline of Pure Reason," explains how philosophy and math are different. Kant says both give us knowledge that is new and certain before experience. But math gives exact answers because it works with things we can imagine clearly, while philosophy only gives general ideas because it deals with the rules for how we can experience things, not the things themselves. 

This chapter also strongly supports freedom to share ideas and to be open-minded when talking about deep questions. Kant argues that reason depends on people freely discussing and honestly expressing their thoughts. This idea about freedom of thought is important in his later political writings. 

The chapter ends by talking about how science and philosophy use guesses differently and explains Kant’s own way of arguing, which he calls "transcendental proofs."

The second chapter, called the "Canon of Pure Reason," compares how we know things in theory with how we understand moral rules. It gives Kant’s most detailed talk about moral philosophy before his famous book on morals in 1785. It also shares his first clear argument for believing in God based on morality, an idea he worked on for the rest of his life.

The third chapter, the "Architectonic of Pure Reason," keeps exploring how philosophy is different from other kinds of knowledge, like history, and looks at the difference between theoretical and practical reason.

The last chapter, the "History of Pure Reason," places Kant’s philosophy among other views like dogmatism, empiricism, skepticism, and indifference, which were discussed at the start of the book. Even though this part is short, it has influenced how people think about the history of philosophy since then.
