Its first chapter, the "Discipline of Pure Reason," provides Kant's most mature treatment of the difference between philosophy and mathematics, arguing that both provide synthetic a priori cognition, but that mathematics provides determinate answers to its problems because its objects can be constructed in pure intuition, whereas philosophy pro­ vides only general principles because what it can construct are the con­ ditions of possibility for the experience of objects, not particular objects (A712-38/B74o-69). Then it provides an ardent defense offreedom of public communication as well as of open-mindedness in the discussion of metaphysical issues, arguing that the very existence of reason itself depends on the free give-and-take of controversy between rational be­ ings, which requires the liberty to come to one's own conclusions hon­ estly and to express them openly to others (A738-69/B766-97). This discussion presages Kant's impassioned defense of freedom of thought in his political writings of the 1790S. The chapter concludes with a dis­ cussion of the contrasting roles of hypotheses in science and philosophy (A769-82/B798-8IO) and then with a reflection upon his own style of philosophical argumentation, what he calls "transcendental proofs" (A 782-941 B 8 IO-2 2).
 
 The second chapter of the "Doctrine of Method," the "Canon of Pure Reason," contrasts the epistemological status of theoretical cogni­ tion with that of the principles and presuppositions of practical reason, or morality, and in so doing provides Kant's most systematic discussion of moral philosophy prior to the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785) and Kant's first systematic statement of his argument for rational faith in God on moral grounds (A 795-83 I IB 82 3-59), an argument that Kant was to restate and refine in the subsequent two critiques and to continue to work on until the end of his life. The third chapter, the "Architectonic of Pure Reason," continues the discussion of the contrast between philosophy and other forms of cognition, such as historical knowledge, as well as of.the contrast within philosophy between theo­ retical and practical reason (A832-5I1B860-79), while the final chapter of the "Doctrine of Method," and of the whole Critique, the "History of Pure Reason," orients the critical philosophy clearly in relation to the competing positions of dogmatism, empiricism, skepticism, and indif­ ferentism, the discussion of which had opened the Critique (A852-561 B 880-84). For all its brevity, this section has had considerable influence on subsequent conceptions of the history of philosophy.
