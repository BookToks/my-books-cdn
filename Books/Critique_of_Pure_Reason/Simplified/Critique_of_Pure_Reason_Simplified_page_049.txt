Kant was once again thinking about the difference between logical relationships and real ones. But in this short essay, he didn’t yet have his own idea about how we could know something like absolute space or make big philosophical conclusions from this question about what space really is.

The Inaugural Dissertation (1770). This changed in Kant’s next work, which was also the last thing he published before a quiet period in the 1770s. This was Kant’s inaugural dissertation, called *On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World*. He finished and published it in August 1770, after he got a new job teaching logic and metaphysics in Königsberg on March 31 of that year. He probably wrote it between March and August. Kant had talked about writing a big new book on how to do metaphysics properly as early as 1765, and his publisher even said it would come out that year. But that plan didn’t happen, and it wasn’t until 1770 that Kant wrote another big work, which turned out to be about the nature of metaphysics itself, not the method.

This work is an important step toward Kant’s later book, *Critique of Pure Reason*. It introduces a key idea: the mind has two main ways of knowing things. One is through the senses, which give us quick and direct images of specific things. Kant calls this “intuition.” The other is through the intellect, which helps us form general ideas or concepts. 

Kant also says, as the title shows, that both intuition and concepts have their own special forms, rules, or laws. We can know these laws, and they are the basis for metaphysics. He introduces an idea he later calls “transcendental idealism.” This means the rules for how we sense things show us how things must appear to us, but not how things really are by themselves. At this stage, Kant thinks that concepts, or ideas made by the intellect, show us things “as they really are.” So, the senses and the intellect give us two different views of things: “phenomena,” which are things as they appear to our senses, and “noumena,” which are things as they really are, known by the intellect.

For now, Kant thinks the senses and the intellect work separately. The main reason for this big difference seems to be Kant’s discovery around 1769. He found that some tricky problems about infinity, which many philosophers had talked about, could be solved by separating how we experience things from how we think about them. For example, time seems to have no beginning when we look at it with our senses, but the intellect can know that everything must have a starting point. So, there’s no contradiction because senses and intellect don’t show us the same thing.
