If we compare the study of the soul, which is about our inner feelings, with the study of bodies, which is about things we see outside, we notice something interesting. In both studies, we can learn a lot from experience. But there’s a big difference: in the study of bodies, we can understand many things just by thinking about them, without needing experience. This is because bodies are things that take up space and can’t be passed through.

On the other hand, when we think about the soul or our mind, we can’t understand anything just by thinking about it. This is because the soul is always changing and doesn’t have a fixed place like objects outside us do. Space, which helps us understand outside things, gives us a stable idea to hold onto, but time, which is how we experience our inner feelings, doesn’t give us that stable idea. Time only shows us changes, not a steady thing.

Everything in the soul is always moving and changing. The only thing that might stay the same is the "I" or self. But this "I" is simple only because it doesn’t have any details or parts. It seems like a single thing, but it’s not really an object we can fully understand.

If this "I" were a clear image in our mind, which we know before any experience, then maybe we could understand the soul just by thinking. But the "I" isn’t like that. It’s not a clear image or a real object. Instead, it’s just the way we are aware of our thoughts.

This awareness helps us understand things only when we also have some experience or image to think about. Because of this, trying to study the soul as a science that goes beyond what we can experience doesn’t work. There’s nothing left to do but observe and think carefully about what we actually experience.
