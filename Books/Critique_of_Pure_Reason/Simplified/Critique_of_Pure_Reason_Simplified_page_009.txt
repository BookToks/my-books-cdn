Making translations consistent. Even though many of Kant’s important books were translated by top experts, some of these translations are old, and the words they use don’t always match up. We wanted to get some of the best Kant experts and translators to create new translations. This way, readers can understand the texts more clearly, almost like reading the original German or Latin versions.

To do this, our editors and translators follow some important rules: 

1. We use one main glossary, especially for Kant’s technical words. While editors can choose their own words, we try to keep terms consistent by having one editor or team work on each group of Kant’s writings, like his practical philosophy or philosophy of religion. This helps keep the language steady when talking about the same topics.

2. Our translators try not to change the meaning just to make the text easier to read. We want the translations to be close to the originals so readers can do their own thinking about the ideas.

3. Kant often makes his points in whole paragraphs or sentences. If we break up his sentences too much to make it simpler, it can turn his argument into just a list of statements. So, we try to keep his original sentence and paragraph structure.

4. Older editions sometimes tried to “fix” Kant’s texts based on different opinions about what they meant. We only fix obvious typos and keep changes to a minimum.

5. We also try not to add our own ideas. For example, we separate Kant’s footnotes from the editors’ language notes and other explanations. The extra notes go at the end, not at the bottom of the page.

We didn’t make all the volumes look exactly the same, but each one has helpful info about when Kant wrote the works, glossaries in both German and English, an index, and other tools to help readers understand. Each volume also starts with an introduction explaining how the translations were done and why certain works were included. We follow the page numbers from the standard German edition of Kant’s works.
