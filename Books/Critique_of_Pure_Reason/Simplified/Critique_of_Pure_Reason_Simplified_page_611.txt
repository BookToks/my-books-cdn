We don’t understand things just by guessing; we always use simpler ideas first. To really know what something looks like in detail, we need to keep breaking down our ideas into smaller parts. This helps us see the different types that still exist, even when we group them into bigger categories.

This way of breaking things down can’t come just from what we experience. Experience can’t show us everything. It only helps us notice differences up to a point. To go further, we need a rule from our thinking that tells us to keep looking for more differences, even if we don’t see them right away.

For example, finding different kinds of earth like chalky or salty earth needed a rule that made us keep searching for types. This rule assumes nature is full of many kinds of things. We understand things because we expect nature to have different types, but also because things in nature share some common traits. It’s the mix of sameness and difference that helps us use ideas and understand.

Our thinking works by 1) grouping things that are alike into big categories, 2) noticing the smaller differences within those groups, and 3) linking all these ideas together so we can move smoothly from one kind to another through small changes.

We call these rules about things being alike, being different, and being connected. The last one happens when we combine the first two, by going up to bigger groups and down to smaller types. This way, everything is related because they all come from one big group at the top.

You can think of every idea like a point. By using these three rules, all the points connect, making a clear system where each idea relates to others.
