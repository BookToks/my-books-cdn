Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic  
We don’t actually know things as they truly are by themselves. What we call “outer objects” are just how our minds show us things, shaped by space. But the real thing itself, the “thing in itself,” can’t be known through these pictures in our mind, and we never actually experience it directly.

The Transcendental Aesthetic Second Section On Time  
Time isn’t something we learn from experience. We can only understand things happening at the same time or one after another because we already have the idea of time in our minds before we experience anything.

Time is a necessary idea that makes all our experiences possible. You can imagine things disappearing, but time itself can’t disappear because it’s what makes all experiences possible.

Because time is this basic idea, it helps us understand how time works for sure, like rules about when things happen. Time only has one direction: moments don’t happen at the same time but one after another, just like spaces don’t happen one after another but all at once.

We can’t learn these rules just by experience because then they wouldn’t always be true. These rules are what let experiences happen in the first place, and they teach us before we even have experiences.

Time isn’t just a general idea we think about; it’s a pure way we sense things. Different moments are all parts of the same time. Also, the idea that different times can’t happen at once isn’t something we figure out by thinking about it—it comes from how we sense time itself.
