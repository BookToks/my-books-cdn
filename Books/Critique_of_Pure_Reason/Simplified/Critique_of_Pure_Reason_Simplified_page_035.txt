In later writings like the Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793), Kant finishes his theory by saying that the only way to prove we are truly free is through the strong feeling that we must follow moral rules. This feeling comes naturally from our own reason, and everyone knows it, even if they don’t always follow it. He says this sense of duty shows that freedom is real, which is needed for us to make moral choices. But this idea depends on his earlier point that science only explains how things seem to us, not things as they really are.

Kant tried to solve two big problems in philosophy at once, but many later thinkers didn’t fully agree with him. Some thought he trusted Newton’s physics too much, leaving no space for newer ideas like relativity or quantum mechanics. Others didn’t think Kant’s idea that science is based on how we think was a good enough way to explain how science really works. Not many liked the idea that freedom can only exist if it’s hidden behind a “veil of ignorance,” or that freedom is our most important value but can only happen if we follow rules—it sounds weird and confusing.

Still, many parts of Kant’s philosophy have become so important that we hardly notice them today. Modern thinkers don’t believe the mind just copies facts or acts like a “mirror of nature.” Even though it’s hard to separate what we add to our understanding from what’s really out there, most agree that we do play an active role in how we know things. Few defend Kant’s strict idea that freedom comes from a clear split between what we see and what really exists, but most still think that even if science says everything is caused by something else, we can still see ourselves as people who make choices based on what seems right to us.

So, many accept Kant’s idea that there is a big difference between looking at things from the outside and acting from the inside. This difference is very important for understanding free will.
