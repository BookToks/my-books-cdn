Part 2, Division 2, Book 2, Chapter 2

When I think about the world as something separate and real, I also imagine it as something active on its own. But this idea could be wrong if the world doesn’t actually exist by itself. Because of that, the world’s size might not be infinite or finite.

Let’s call this kind of disagreement a “dialectical opposition.” There’s another kind called an “analytical opposition” that is simply when two statements directly contradict each other. So, two statements that seem opposite in a dialectical way might both be wrong because they say more than just opposite things.

If you think the two ideas, “The world is infinite in size” and “The world is finite in size,” are simply opposite, then you are assuming the world really exists on its own. The world stays the same even if you don’t accept that it goes on forever or stops somewhere.

But if you stop assuming the world exists by itself, then the two opposite statements don’t directly contradict each other anymore. Instead, they just seem like different opinions because the world, as something real and separate, doesn’t exist at all. The world only exists in the way we experience it, not as something by itself.

Because the world is always connected to other things and never fully given to us, it isn’t a complete whole that is either infinite or finite. What I said about the world’s size also applies to other big ideas about the world.

The series of things we see or experience only happens because we keep looking back and breaking it down, but we never find the whole thing by itself before we do that. So, the number of parts in what we see isn’t really finite or infinite by itself. The parts only appear when we break things down step by step, and this process never gives us the whole thing completely, either as finite or infinite.

The same idea applies to causes or things that depend on each other. We can’t look at them separated from the whole chain of causes, and they aren’t given to us as a complete set on their own.
