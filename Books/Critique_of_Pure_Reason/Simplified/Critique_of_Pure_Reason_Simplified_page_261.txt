I am aware of different things I experience. The way I put these experiences together in my mind, even before I start thinking about them, is what makes me recognize that I am the same person.

This putting together doesn’t come from the things themselves. It can’t be taken from what I see or feel. Instead, it’s something my mind does. My understanding is the ability to combine different ideas and make them into one clear thought. This is the most important rule for how humans think and know things.

This rule, called the unity of apperception, is always true. It means my mind has to connect all the different parts of what I experience, or else I couldn’t think of myself as the same person. The “I” by itself doesn’t have any details. Those details come from what I sense and then connect in my mind. My mind can’t just know everything at once like seeing it all at once; it has to think and bring it together from what I sense.

I know I am the same person because I call all these different experiences “mine.” This means I am aware that my mind combines them naturally, which is called the original synthetic unity of apperception. All the things I experience must be joined together in my mind by this process.

The rule of this unity of apperception is the most important rule for how I understand things.

Before, I learned that all the things I sense happen in space and time. Now, I learn that all the things I experience also have to be combined by this unity of apperception. Space and time are not just ideas; they are actual ways my mind organizes what I experience. Because of this, all my experiences are connected and combined in one awareness.
