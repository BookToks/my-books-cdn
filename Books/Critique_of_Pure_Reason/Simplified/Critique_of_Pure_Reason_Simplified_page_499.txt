The idea of freedom in philosophy is different from how we usually think about it in psychology. In psychology, freedom is mostly about real-life experiences, but in philosophy, it means the ability to start an action completely on your own without anything causing it first. This idea is really hard for philosophers to accept because it means something can cause itself without anything else making it happen.

The big question about free will that confuses philosophers is whether it’s possible for something to start a chain of events all by itself. We don’t have to fully understand how this works, just like we don’t fully understand how one event causes another in nature, but we accept it because we see it happen.

We only need to accept that freedom is necessary to explain the beginning of everything—the origin of the world. After the first event, everything else can follow natural laws. Since we’ve accepted that something can start a chain of events on its own, it makes sense that many different things in the world could also start their own chains and act freely.

But we should not get confused. Just because a chain of events in the world has a first step that happens after something else, it doesn’t mean there isn’t an absolutely first beginning from itself somewhere.
