Kant says that the idea of space is a "pure intuition." That means space is something we understand directly, not from mixing different feelings or senses. It’s something we assume before we even notice objects outside of us.

Kant doesn’t give the full explanation that space is continuous here, but he uses an old argument about things like right- and left-handedness. Since we can’t figure those out just by thinking about objects, we must understand them through this special pure intuition. This part is left out in his later work.

Just like with time, Kant thinks space isn’t something real or physical. It’s not a thing or a property but comes from how our mind works. Space is how our mind organizes what we sense from outside.

He also argues against the idea that space is an unlimited container where things exist, calling that idea silly. Plus, he disagrees with Leibniz, who said geometry just comes from noticing how objects relate. Kant says that would make geometry less certain, turning it into just another science based on experience.

In the end, Kant says even if space isn’t real or objective, it’s still a concept that’s very true when it comes to everything we sense outside ourselves. Space is the base for all truth in how we experience the world. This idea shows that space is both personal (in our minds) but also universal and necessary.

This way of thinking about space and time stays mostly the same in Kant’s later work, the Critique. But in an earlier section, Kant talks about the idea that many substances can form one world only because they depend on a single cause. This idea comes from Leibniz and says that each necessary substance exists on its own, but things that can change depend on a cause. Because of this shared cause, they make up one world. This part disappears in Kant’s later Critique.
