 41 Erdmann, following Vaihinger, substitutes "§ 10" for the original "§ 13.
 
 This reflects the fact that Kant derives the table of categories from the table of the logical functions of judgment in § 10 (as numbered in the second edi­ tion). However, it is in § 13t hat Kant raises the question of whether the cat­ egories necessarily apply to all of our possible experience in the way that space and time as the forms of intuition do; his reference to § 13 here is pre­ sumably intended to show that here is where he has finally answered the question raised in that earlier section. Thus we leave Kant's reference as it stands.
 
 42 For an important note on the problem of inner sense, see R 5655 (1788-89, 18:3I 3 -16).
 
 43 Kant continued to worry about the problem of inner sense until the end of his career; for late reflections, see R 6349 (1797, 18:672-5), R 6350 (1797, 18:675-7, especially p. 675), and R 6354 (1797, 18:680). The claim that the unidimensionality of time must be represented by the spatial figure of a line, although it does not figure in the "Refutation of Ideal­ ism" added at B 274-9 below, does figure in the version of the "Refu­ tation" found at R 5653 (1788, 18:306-12, at pp. 308-9). The distinct claim that changes in time and the determinate duration of intervals be­ tween changes in time can only be empirically known on the basis of periodic changes in objects in space is emphasized throughout the drafts of the "Refutation" found in R 6311-17 (1790, 18:607-29). See also B 288-92 below.
 
 44 To this note, compare the draft of an essay entitled "Answer to the ques­ tion, Is it an experience mati think?" at R 5661 (1788-9°, 18:318-20). See also A 402 and Kant's long footnote at B 422-3n., below.
 
 45 By this term, here first introduced, Kant refers back to the derivation of me categories from the logical functions of judgment (§§ 9-12). This new designation for mat argument is widely used in me literature on Kant.
 
 46 To mis note, compare R 5926 (1783-84, 18:388).
 
 47 On mis conception of nature, see R 5406-1I (I776-I780s, 18:174-5).
 
 48 This term alludes to the biological meory that the germ cells of the two parents give rise to the embryo as a new product, rather than as me evolution of something preformed; the theory of epigenesis is the an­ tithesis of the theory of preformation, and not just a contrast to the con­ cept of generatio aequivoca. For another instance of Kant's use of this and the related biological terms to classify philosophical theories, see his classification of theories of reproduction at Critique of Judgment, § 81 (5:421-4).
 
 49 This alludes to the biological theory, the antithesis of epigenesis, mat the embryo exists completely formed in me germ cell of one parent and mat the other parent's germ cell only stimulates it to growm.
 
 727 Notes to pages 269-285 Transcendental analytic (''Analytic of principles'') 50 Kant's view that judgment may be taught by examples but that there is a limit to the efficacy of principles has deep roots in this thought; see R 1580 (1769-70, 16:23).
