Immanuel Kant’s work on theoretical philosophy talks about how we understand things. He looks closely at how we make judgments and how these judgments connect to categories of thought.

Kant explains that the categories come from logical functions of judgment, especially in a section called § 10 in his book. But later, in § 13, he asks if these categories always apply to everything we can experience, just like space and time do. That’s where he finally answers this big question.

There’s also a problem Kant worries about called “inner sense,” which means how we understand our own mind and time inside us. He thought about this problem for his whole life. One idea he had is that time is like a straight line in space, which helps us understand how time works. He also said we can only know time by seeing changes happening in space, like clocks moving.

Kant wrote an essay asking, "Is thinking an experience?" and this is connected to his ideas on judgment and knowledge. He uses the word “argument” in a special way to explain how categories come from judgment.

He also talks about nature and biology in his philosophy. One theory he mentions is epigenesis, which says that an embryo develops from simple cells of both parents and is not already fully formed. This is different from another theory that says the embryo is already complete in one parent’s cell and just needs to grow.

Finally, Kant believed that we can learn how to judge things by examples, but there are limits to how much general principles can teach us. This idea has been important in his work from early on.
