Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter II

To explain the basic rules of reason, let’s look at an example from real life—not to prove the rules, because that’s impossible for big, deep ideas. Imagine someone lies on purpose, causing confusion in society. First, we try to understand why they did it. We look at things like their bad upbringing, bad friends, or a mean personality that doesn’t care about feeling shame. We also consider if they were careless or didn’t think things through. This is like figuring out the causes of any natural event.

Even if we believe these things caused the lie, we still blame the person. We don’t blame their bad personality, their situation, or their past life. Instead, we act like all those things don’t matter and think that the person could have chosen differently. We imagine that this one action started a new path all by itself from the person’s own choice.

We blame the person because of the law of reason. This means reason can cause someone to act differently, no matter what outside influences they have. Reason doesn’t just work with other causes; it can fully control what a person does, even if everything around them pushes them to lie. So, the action is the result of the person’s true self at that moment. The lie is entirely their fault.

This shows that reason isn’t affected by feelings or outside pressure. It can and should control a person’s choices. If it fails to do that, the person is fully responsible for what they do.
