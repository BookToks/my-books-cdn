Philosophy doesn’t start with fixed rules that everyone just accepts right away. Instead, it has to prove why these rules are true by carefully explaining and checking them.

Only a really clear and obvious proof, one that you can understand right away, can be called a true demonstration. Experience can show us how things are, but it can’t prove that things couldn’t be different. So, proofs based on experience can’t be completely certain.

When we think through ideas step by step (using concepts), we can be sure about some things, but we don’t get that clear, obvious certainty. That’s why only math has real demonstrations. Math doesn’t just use ideas—it builds on clear mental pictures we create before any experience. Even algebra, where you solve equations, uses special ways to show these ideas clearly so you can see the truth and avoid mistakes.

Philosophy, on the other hand, has to work with abstract ideas and words only. Math can look at exact examples and use clear mental images to avoid errors, but philosophy can’t do that. So, I’d call philosophy’s proofs “acroamatic” or reasoning based on ideas, not true “demonstrations,” which come from clear mental images.

Because of all this, philosophy shouldn’t act like it’s just like math or try to copy math’s style. Philosophy isn’t part of math, though it can work well with it. Trying to pretend it’s the same only causes problems. Philosophy’s real goal is to show where reason can make mistakes and help people understand their limits with clear thinking.

So, when philosophy works on deep ideas, it can’t be too confident that it’s on a straight path to the answer. It also can’t just assume its starting points are obviously true without careful checking.
