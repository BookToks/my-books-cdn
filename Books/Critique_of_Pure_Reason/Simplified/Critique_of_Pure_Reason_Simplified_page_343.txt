There are some basic rules about how nature works that we can know without needing to see or experience them first. One rule says that nothing in nature happens by pure chance or luck—everything happens for a reason and can be understood. Another rule says that nature’s changes don’t happen randomly; they follow a certain order or pattern.

These rules help explain how things change and how we understand those changes. The first rule comes from the idea that every effect has a cause. The second rule adds the idea that some things must happen, not just might happen, and this follows how our minds understand things.

There’s also a rule that says nature doesn’t skip steps or have sudden jumps between one event and the next. Everything changes smoothly and continuously. This means we can’t have empty spaces or gaps in what we experience in the world. If we think about a vacuum or empty space outside what we can experience, that’s a different kind of problem that goes beyond what our minds can directly understand.

We can organize these ideas into groups based on how they relate to each other. But the main point is that none of these rules allow anything that breaks the way we understand the world or the continuous connection between events. This connection is what makes our experience of the world possible.

It’s also important to ask if the things that could possibly happen are more than the things that actually do happen, and if those are more than the things that must happen. These are big questions that need careful thought.
