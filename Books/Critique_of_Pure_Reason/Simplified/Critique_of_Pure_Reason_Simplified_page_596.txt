Critique of all speculative theology all kinship with it and had proposed to base everything on evident proofs from experience.
 
 Thus the physico-theologians have no cause at all to be so coy when it comes to the transcendental kind of proof and to look down on it with the self-conceit of clearsighted students of nature looking down on the webs spun by gloomy quibblers. a For if they would only examine them­ selves, they would find that after they have made a certain amount of progress on the territory of nature and experience and seen themselves A630/ B 658 just as far removed as ever from the object with which their reason seems to confront them/ they suddenly leave this territory and pass over into the realm of mere possibilities, where on the wings of ideas they hope to approach that which has eluded all their empirical inquiries. After they finally suppose they have got firm footing through such a mighty leap, then they extend the now determinate concept (without knowing how they have come to be in possession of it) over the entire field of creation, and they elucidate the ideal, which was merely the product of pure reason -though shabbily enough and in a way far beneath the dignity of its object -through experience, though without being willing to concede that they have achieved their acquaintance with it, or their presupposition of it, while they were on a different footpath from that of experience.
 
 Accordingly, the physico-theological proof of the existence of a sin­ gle original being as the highest being is grounded on the cosmologi­ cal, and the latter on the ontological; and since besides these three paths no more are open to speculative reason, the ontological proof from pure concepts of reason is the only possible one -if even one proof of a proposition elevated so sublimely above all empirical use of the un­ derstanding is possible at all.

II2 If by "theology" I understand the cognition of the original being, then it is either from pure reason (theologia rationalis) or from revelation (rev­ elata).
