All kinds of speculative theology and ideas like it try to base everything on clear proof from experience.

So, the physico-theologians shouldn’t act so shy or look down on the kind of proof that goes beyond what we can see. If they really thought about it, they would see that after studying nature and experience for a while, they are still just as far from understanding the real thing their reason is trying to reach. Then, they leave what they know from experience and move into the world of possibilities, hoping to get closer to what they can’t find by looking at the world around them.

When they think they’ve finally found a solid idea by making this big jump, they take that idea (without really knowing how they got it) and apply it to everything in creation. They explain this ideal, which only comes from pure reason, by using experience, but they don’t admit that they actually reached this idea by thinking beyond experience.

Because of this, the physico-theological proof that there is one original highest being is based on the cosmological proof, which itself is based on the ontological proof. And since these three are the only ways that speculative reason can work, the ontological proof, which comes from pure concepts of reason, is the only possible one—if any proof at all is possible for something so high above what we can learn from experience.

If we think of theology as knowledge about the original being, it can come from pure reason (called rational theology) or from revelation (things made known by God). The first kind tries to understand its subject only through pure reason, using special ideas like the "original being," "most real being," or "being of beings," and this is called transcendental theology.
