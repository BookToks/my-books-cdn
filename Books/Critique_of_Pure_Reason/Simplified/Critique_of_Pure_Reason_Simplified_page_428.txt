When we talk about the paralogisms of pure reason, we mean the ideas that shape how we think about things. I can’t imagine a thinking being by looking outside; I can only know about thinking through being aware of myself. So, when I imagine other thinking beings, I’m just projecting my own self-awareness onto them.

The statement "I think" is used here in a special way. It doesn’t mean “I am” like Descartes said, but just the possibility that thinking could happen. This helps us explore what qualities might come from this simple idea, whether or not the thinker actually exists right now.

If we tried to understand thinking beings by looking at how our thoughts work or by studying psychology based on experience, that would be like a science of the mind. This science might explain how we feel or think inside, but it can’t tell us about things that are beyond experience. So, it wouldn’t be a true, pure understanding of thinking beings.

Since the phrase "I think" contains the basic form of all judgments and is part of all our ideas, what we learn from it must be based only on reason without mixing in experience. At first, we don’t have a clear idea of where this will lead, so we’ll carefully follow the reasoning through the main ideas about the soul.

The first paralogism is about substance. Substance means something that is the main subject of our thoughts and can’t be just a property of something else.

I, as a thinking being, am the main subject of all my thoughts.

I think.
