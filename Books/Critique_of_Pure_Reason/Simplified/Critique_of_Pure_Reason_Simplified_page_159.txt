Metaphysics is about ideas like "The world must have a first beginning," and others like that. These ideas are called synthetic a priori propositions, which means they are true without needing to be proven by experience, and they add new knowledge.

The big question for pure reason is: How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?

Metaphysics has been confusing and full of disagreements because no one really thought about this question before, or even about the difference between analytic and synthetic judgments. Whether metaphysics works or not depends on solving this problem or proving that it can’t be solved.

David Hume came closest to this problem but didn’t fully understand it or see how broad it really is. He stopped at the idea that the connection between cause and effect can’t be known without experience. He thought metaphysics was just a mistake, based on habits and experience, not real knowledge. But if he had understood the problem better, he would have seen that this idea would also mean pure mathematics isn’t real, which we know isn’t true. His common sense would have stopped him from making that mistake.
