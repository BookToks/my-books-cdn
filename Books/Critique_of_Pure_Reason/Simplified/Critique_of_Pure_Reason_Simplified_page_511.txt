Pt. II. Div. II. Bk. II. Ch. II the two parties proceed. In the assertions of the antithesis,a one notes a perfect uniformity in their manner of thought and complete unity in A466/B494 their maxims, namely a principleb of pure empiricism, not only in the explanation of appearances in the world, but also in the dissolution of the transcendental ideas of the world-whole itself. Against this the as­ sertions of the thesis are grounded not only on empiricism within the series of appearances but also on intellectualistic starting points,c and their maxim is to that extent not simple. On the basis of their essential distinguishing mark, however, I will call them the dogmatism of pure reason.
 
 Thus in determining the cosmological ideas of reason, the side of dogmatism or the thesis exhibits: First, a certain practical interest, in which every well-disposed per­ son, once he understands its true advantage to him, heartily shares.
 
 That the world has a beginning, that my thinking self is of a simple and therefore incorruptible nature, that this self is likewise free and elevated above natural compulsion in its voluntary actions, and finally, that the whole order of things constituting the world descends from an original being, from which it borrows all its unity and purposive connect­ edness -these are so many cornerstones of morality and religion. The antithesis robs us of all these supports, or at least seems to rob us of them.68 Second, a speculative interest of reason is expressed on this side too. For if one assumes and employs the transcendental ideas in such a A4671B495 way, then one can grasp the whole chain of conditions fully priori and a comprehend the derivation of the conditioned, starting with the uncon­ ditioned, which the antithesis cannot do; this gives it a bad recommen­ dation, since it can give no answers to questions about the conditions of their synthesis that do not leave something out, and with its answers fur­ ther questions without any end are always left over. According to the an­ tithesis, one must ascend from a given beginning to a still higher one, every part leads to a still smaller part, every event always has another event above it as its cause, and the conditions of existence in general are always supported again by others, without ever getting stability and sup­ port from a self-sufficient thing as an unconditioned original being.
 
 Third, this side also has the merit of popularity, which certainly constitutes no small part of what recommends it. The common undera the antithesis in each antinomy b Principium , intellektuelle Anfonge; d. A8S3/B88I, where those who hold that the essential object of cognition is supersensuous (Plato is taken as the paradigtlI and contrasted with Epicurus, just as is done here at A471 IB 500) are called "intellectualistic philosophers" or "intel­ lectualists" (Intellektualphilosophen, Intellektuellen).
