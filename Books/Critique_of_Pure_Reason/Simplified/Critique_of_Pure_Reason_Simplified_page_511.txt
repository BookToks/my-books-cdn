In this part, two sides argue about big ideas. The antithesis side thinks in a very clear and consistent way. They believe everything we know comes only from experience, not from ideas beyond what we can see or feel. They use this idea to explain the world and to reject ideas about the world as a whole that go beyond experience.

The thesis side, on the other hand, uses experience but also includes ideas that come from thinking alone, not just from what we sense. Their way of thinking is more complicated. Because of this, I will call their approach the “dogmatism of pure reason.”

When we look at big ideas about the universe, the dogmatism side shows three important things.

First, it has a practical purpose. Anyone who understands its benefits will agree with it. For example, it says the world had a beginning, that our mind is simple and cannot be destroyed, that we have free will, and that everything in the world comes from one original being. These ideas support morality and religion. The antithesis side seems to take these supports away from us.

Second, the dogmatism side also has a way of thinking that tries to understand everything fully. It uses big ideas to explain how everything is connected, starting from something that does not depend on anything else. The antithesis side cannot do this. It always ends up with more questions because it says every cause has another cause, and nothing is truly independent or final.

Third, the dogmatism side is popular. Many people like it, and this popularity helps make it convincing.
