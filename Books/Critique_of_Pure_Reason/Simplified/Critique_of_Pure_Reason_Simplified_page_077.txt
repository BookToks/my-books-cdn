Kant said that the idea of the soul comes from the way we connect all our thoughts and feelings to ourselves, thinking of ourselves as the only permanent thing.

The idea of something that is not caused by anything else comes from our reason telling us to look for a complete understanding of everything by organizing it step by step.

The idea of one ultimate unity of everything we can think about is needed to try to find how all things are connected. Kant says it’s normal for us to have these ideas and even feel like we have to have them, but it’s wrong to think they give us real knowledge about things we can’t see or experience.

Kant split his thoughts on mistakes about the self, the world, and God into three parts: rational psychology, rational cosmology, and rational theology. Before, ideas about the soul were just part of other arguments about simple things or freedom. He made rational theology its own part because there was too much to cover in one section. He looked again at old arguments about God and added his own thoughts, keeping some ideas from earlier parts of his work. It would have been hard to fit his new ideas about the perfect reason into just one argument.

The new criticism of rational psychology, called the "Paralogism," first appeared in notes from 1778-79. It seems like Kant wrote this in response to his new way of proving how categories (basic ideas) work. Since he said that having one unified consciousness is a basic need for understanding categories, he also warns us not to assume anything too big about the soul—like thinking the soul is a single, simple, and eternal thing—just because consciousness feels unified.
