The different parts of what we see can be understood through our senses, which means just receiving information. The way we take in this information is built into us from the start, and it’s just how we are affected by what’s around us.

But putting these parts together in general doesn’t come from our senses. This means it’s not already included in the way we sense things. Instead, it’s something our mind does on its own. Since this is different from just sensing, we call this part the understanding.

All the ways we combine things—whether it’s parts of what we see or ideas—are actions of our understanding. We call this process synthesis. This is important because we can’t think of something as combined in the real world unless we have put it together ourselves first. Combining ideas or pieces isn’t given to us by the world; it’s something our mind does actively.

This action of combining has to be one single, unified process, and it works the same way for all combinations.
