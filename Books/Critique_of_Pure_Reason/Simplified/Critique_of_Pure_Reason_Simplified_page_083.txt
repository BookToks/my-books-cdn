The second edition of Kant’s work changed a lot because of feedback from critics and Kant’s own thoughts.

First, Kant wrote a much longer preface. Instead of just saying why metaphysics needs a solid base, he explained his new critical method in detail. He compared his approach in philosophy to how Copernicus changed astronomy by putting the sun in the center instead of the Earth. Kant also said that pure reason is more useful in practical life than in theory, answering some critics who didn’t agree. The preface ends with a note about the new changes and a big footnote that updates an important part called the "Refutation of Idealism."

Second, the introduction got bigger too. Kant talked more about the difference between knowledge you get before experience (a priori) and knowledge from experience (a posteriori). He also explained more why math and physics need his idea of transcendental idealism, which he took from his earlier work called the Prolegomena. This shows he really wanted to point out how his ideas were different from Berkeley’s idealism, because Berkeley couldn’t explain a priori knowledge well.

Third, the "Transcendental Aesthetic" section was expanded a lot. Kant wanted to strengthen his argument against Berkeley’s ideas by showing why transcendental idealism is necessary to explain certain kinds of knowledge, especially in math. He split the part about space and time into two sections: one called "Metaphysical," which talks about space and time as pure forms we use to sense things, and another called "Transcendental Exposition," which explains how math depends on this idea. He also added new arguments supporting transcendental idealism that weren’t in the first edition.

Finally, the "Transcendental Deduction" section was almost completely rewritten. Only two small parts stayed the same, but the rest was replaced with new content, making it much longer and more detailed than before.
