Pure reason philosophy is either a preparation step that looks into how reason works with all pure knowledge we get before experience, called critique, or it’s a full system that connects all true and seeming knowledge from pure reason, called metaphysics. Metaphysics can mean all pure philosophy, including critique, since it studies everything we can know without experience and shows how all this knowledge fits together, unlike reason used in science or math.

Metaphysics is split into two parts: one about theories (speculative) and one about morals (practical). The first part deals with principles from just ideas (not math) to understand everything theoretically. The second part deals with rules that tell us what actions we must or must not do, based only on reason. Morality is the only set of rules for actions that we can get completely from reason alone, without using experience. So, metaphysics of morals is pure morality, not based on human feelings or conditions. The metaphysics about ideas has usually been called metaphysics in a narrow way, but since pure morals also come from reason, we keep calling it metaphysics too, even though we won’t focus on it here.

It’s very important to separate different kinds of knowledge and not mix them up with others that seem similar. Like chemists break down materials and mathematicians study pure shapes and sizes, philosophers must do the same to understand what kind of knowledge has real value instead of just guessing. People have never been able to do without metaphysics as long as they have thought deeply, even if they never made it completely pure. The idea of this science is as old as human thinking itself; what doesn’t reason try to understand, whether in a fancy or simple way?
