Kant didn’t yet realize how hard his work would be, but in his book *Critique of Pure Reason* and later writings, he aimed to show that knowing about the "unity of nature" or the constant laws of nature is necessary for our experiences to make sense. He also wanted to explain how we can even know these laws.

Kant’s ideas about cause-and-effect laws were developed more in his last important work from 1762-63, an essay called *Negative Magnitudes*. But before we get to that, let’s look at an earlier step he took toward the *Critique*: a work called *Inquiry concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality*. Kant wrote this in late 1762 and sent it to the Berlin Academy of Sciences by January 1, 1763. It was for a contest about whether metaphysics (which includes natural theology and ethics) could be as certain as math and use the same methods. The Academy, mostly made up of Wolffians, gave first prize to Moses Mendelssohn’s clearer restatement of Wolffian ideas but still gave Kant an honorable mention and published his essay along with Mendelssohn’s (though not until 1764).

Mendelssohn, following the rationalist tradition, argued that math and philosophy use similar methods. He even suggested metaphysics could be more certain than math. He explained that proving math theorems depends only on applying logic to math ideas, but whether those math statements are true depends on the fact that math fits what we see in the world. Mendelssohn said metaphysical arguments mostly follow math proof methods but differ in two important cases where the link between the proof system and reality doesn’t need to be checked by observation but can be known just by thinking. These two cases are the metaphysics of the soul (what Kant later called "rational psychology"), where Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am” shows the soul exists without needing evidence, and the metaphysics of God (or "rational theology"), where Mendelssohn accepted the ontological argument that proves God’s existence just from the idea of God. Because these parts of philosophy can prove existence without observation, Mendelssohn thought philosophy could be even more certain than math.
