The Critique of Pure Reason is complicated and covers many ideas. Its overall message and its impact on philosophy are hard to explain in a simple way. People often say it offers a middle path that combines the good parts of both "rationalism" (ideas from Descartes and Leibniz) and "empiricism" (ideas from Locke and Hume). But this view is a bit too simple and doesn’t fully appreciate Kant’s work or the thinkers before him.

What is clearer is that Kant’s main goal is to find a balance between old metaphysics, which tries to prove religious ideas using reason alone, and skepticism, which doubts everything, including science and religion.

Kant explains his critical philosophy by comparing it to other approaches like dogmatism, empiricism, skepticism, and indifferentism. He wants to create a special area for philosophy that is important but limited. This area is different from things we learn through experience or common sense, and it avoids making wild claims that hurt metaphysics’ reputation.

The Critique of Pure Reason is part of a tradition started by Descartes that tries to build a strong, logical foundation for modern science. It does this by studying how well our minds can understand nature in the way science aims to do.

At the same time, Kant tries to protect what dogmatic metaphysicians fail to save by connecting religious beliefs not to theory but to moral actions. He famously says we should limit what we claim to know so there is room for faith. But he does all this in a true Enlightenment style, always putting our ability to think and reflect first. We should check and control our reason, making sure it limits itself so that human reason stays in charge of what we know, believe, and do. Our thinking is free and doesn’t have to follow any outside authority.

Kant’s Critique is original because it tries to solve two really tough problems from early modern philosophy: proving that everything happens for a reason (universal causality) and that humans still have free will.
