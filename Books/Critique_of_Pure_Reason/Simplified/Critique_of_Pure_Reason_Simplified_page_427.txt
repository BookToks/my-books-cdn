From these basic ideas, all the pure thoughts about the soul come, without needing any other ideas. This soul, just as something we feel inside, gives us the idea that it is not made of stuff. As a simple thing, it shows us that it can’t be broken down or destroyed. Its unchanging nature makes us think of it as a person. All these ideas together make us understand that the soul is spiritual. Because it relates to things in space, it can interact with bodies. So, the thinking soul is seen as the cause of life in matter, meaning it is the soul and the base of being an animal. And since it is spiritual, it is also immortal.

Now, from these ideas come four mistakes in a kind of false science about the soul. This false science wrongly thinks it knows everything about what our thinking self really is. At the core of this wrong idea is just the simple thought of “I,” which is empty by itself. We can’t even call it a real idea; it’s just the feeling that goes with every idea.

This “I,” or “he,” or “it” that thinks, only shows us a thinking subject called “x,” which we only know through the thoughts it has. But if we try to think about “x” alone, we can’t really understand it. This puts us in a loop because we always need to think about “I” to understand anything about it. We can’t get away from this problem because the feeling of knowing itself isn’t even a clear idea of a specific thing! It’s just the way we know anything at all. Because of this, we can only say that “I think” through this feeling.

At first, it seems strange that the condition for me to think, which is just a part of me, would also be true for everything that thinks. It looks like we are making a strong and certain rule based on something that seems just like an experience. But this happens because we must always, before experience, assume that things relate to each other in certain ways.
