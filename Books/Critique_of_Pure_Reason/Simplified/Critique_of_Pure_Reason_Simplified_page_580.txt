Figuring out what something really is almost makes teaching about it impossible. You can use anything as a description, and even the thing itself can describe itself because logic ignores the actual details. But a description should say more than just what the thing is—it should add something new.

So, the description can’t already be part of what the thing is.

Being is not a real description that adds new information. It's just saying that something exists or that certain features exist. In logic, “is” just connects the subject and the description. For example, in the sentence “God is all-powerful,” the words “God” and “all-powerful” are the ideas, but “is” just links them; it doesn’t add any new meaning.

If I take the subject (God) and all the things I say about him (like being all-powerful) and say “God exists,” I’m not adding anything new about God. I’m just saying that God with all these features exists. Both have the same meaning, so when I say “God exists,” I’m not adding anything new, just confirming the idea.

The real thing doesn’t have more in it than just the idea of it. For example, a hundred real dollars don’t have more than the idea of a hundred dollars. The idea shows what’s possible, and the real thing is just that idea made real. If the real thing had more, then my idea wouldn’t fully describe it, so my idea wouldn’t be complete.

But in real life, having a hundred actual dollars is more than just thinking about having them, because it changes my situation. Still, the dollars themselves don’t change just because they exist outside my idea.

So, when I think about something with all its descriptions, nothing new is added just by saying it exists. If something real had more than I thought, then what exists wouldn’t be the same as what I imagined, and I couldn’t say the same thing about it.
