If something happens, just the fact that it starts happening is already something worth studying. We need to look at how something changes from not existing to existing, even if that new thing doesn’t seem to have any special qualities.

This change doesn’t mean a whole new thing pops into existence out of nothing. It’s just a change in the condition or state of something that already exists. If we think this new state is caused by something else, we call that creation. But that idea of creation doesn’t fit with how we experience things, because it would mess up the idea that everything we see is connected.

Now, how can something change at all? How can one state be followed by a completely different one? We don’t know this just by thinking about it. We need to learn about actual forces from experience, like seeing things move or change. But the way change happens, or the rule behind one state coming after another, can still be understood by thinking about cause and effect and how time works.

If something changes from state A to state B, then the time when state B happens is different and comes after the time of state A. Also, state B is different from state A, like how a number is different from zero. If state B is even a little different in size or amount from state A, then the change is like something new appearing that wasn’t there before.

Just to be clear, I’m not talking about changes in relationships or positions in general, but about the actual state itself. For example, if a body moves at the same speed all the time, its state doesn’t change. But if it speeds up or slows down, then its state does change.
