The Heidemann edition is the closest to the original versions, but it updates the spelling a bit. We have also checked the translation against copies of the original editions.

Now, a few words about the typography we chose. The original editions mainly used Fraktur, which is a gothic style of writing. Latin words like "a priori," "a posteriori," "phenomena," and "noumena" were written in a different style called roman type because Kant didn’t think they were fully part of the German language.

Instead of using italics like in English or spaced letters like in modern German to show emphasis, the original used bigger and thicker Fraktur letters (kind of like bold text). To copy how Kant’s pages looked, we used bold type for emphasis and italics for foreign words printed in roman type.

The original had different sizes of bold letters, which sometimes made it easy and sometimes hard to tell if a word was meant to be emphasized. This causes disagreements in modern editions about which words to emphasize. We didn’t try to copy all these size differences.

Also, Kant sometimes used bold letters to show a word or sentence was being mentioned, not used in the normal way. When he did this, we used bold type; when he didn’t, we put the word in quotation marks.

About earlier English translations: We followed Kemp Smith a lot in how he translated Kant’s special terms because he often used Kant’s own Latin words to help decide the English. After using Kemp Smith’s translation for years, his style stuck with us too. But this work isn’t just a revision of Kemp Smith’s; we often translate things differently on purpose.

We always worked from the original German texts, checking Kemp Smith and also older English translations. Of these, Friedrich Max Muller’s (1881) was more helpful than J. M. D. Meikeljohn’s (1855). Surprisingly, Francis Haywood’s full translation of the second edition (1848) was very useful too. It’s the earliest English translation we could find, and like us, Haywood tried to be very literal.

In the bibliography, we list the German editions we used, the earlier English translations we checked, and some important scholarly works about the Critique’s history and text.
