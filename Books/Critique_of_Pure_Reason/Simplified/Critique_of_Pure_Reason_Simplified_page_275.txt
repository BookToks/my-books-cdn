Part II, Division 1, Book 1, Chapter 2.

The way we understand many things around us, inside or outside ourselves, follows certain rules that are already known before we experience anything. These rules help us put together all the different parts we notice into one clear picture. This process happens in our mind first, based on how we naturally sense things like space and time.

All the combining of information, even just noticing something, follows these rules, which are called categories. Because learning from experience comes from connecting what we sense, these categories are needed for any experience to happen. They are true for everything we can experience, even before we actually experience it.

For example, if I look at a house and turn what I see into a clear idea, I do this by putting together all its parts in space. I imagine its shape based on these rules of how things fit together in space. This same way of putting parts together, if I don’t think about space, happens in my understanding and is called the category of quantity. This means the way I combine what I see matches these rules perfectly.

Another example is when I see water freezing. I notice two states—liquid and solid—that happen one after the other in time. Time helps me understand how these two states relate. The rule that lets me connect these moments in time is called the category of cause. This means I know one thing causes the other because of how time works in my mind.

In short, the way I put together what I sense (like images or feelings) must follow the same rules as how I understand and think about them. It’s the same creative power in my mind, sometimes called imagination and sometimes understanding, that helps me combine all the pieces into one clear idea.
