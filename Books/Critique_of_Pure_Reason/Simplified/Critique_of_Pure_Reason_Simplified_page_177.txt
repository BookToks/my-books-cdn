Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic

Time is something we understand before we experience anything, and it is a basic part of how we see everything. Time is the first thing that makes it possible for us to notice what’s happening inside us, like our thoughts and feelings, and it also helps us understand things happening outside us.

Just like we know that all things outside us exist in space, we can also say that all things we sense happen in time and follow time’s order.

If we stop thinking about how we personally experience time, and instead think about things as they really are by themselves, then time doesn’t really exist. Time only matters when we talk about things we can see, hear, or feel because those things come from how we experience the world. So, time is a part of how we, as humans, understand things. Without us, time wouldn’t be a real thing. But when it comes to things we experience, time is always there and important.

We can’t say that all things exist in time because that would mean ignoring how we experience things. But when we include how we experience things, it’s true that everything we sense happens in time. This idea is true for all things we can ever experience.

Our understanding shows that time is real when it comes to everything we can sense. Since we always experience things through our senses, we can’t experience anything that isn’t in time. But we argue that time is not something that exists on its own by itself, separate from how we experience things.

Things that exist on their own, without being sensed, don’t have properties like time that we can know through our senses. That’s why time is what we call "transcendental ideal" — it doesn’t exist if we don’t think about how we sense things. Time doesn’t exist by itself in things outside of our experience. But this idea about time is different from just thinking that time is a trick of our senses, because the things we experience are real and not just illusions.
