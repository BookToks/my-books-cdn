To understand everything real inside themselves, people need to think about time and space in a certain way. Some thinkers believe that space and time are just ways we see things happen one after another, based on our experience. They say these ideas come from our imagination, made from what we experience, but they don’t exist on their own. This means you can’t be 100% sure about math rules that are supposed to be true before you experience anything.

Others believe that space and time are real and help us understand the world through math. But if we try to think about things beyond what we see, these ideas get confusing. The second group can judge objects without just thinking about how they appear, but they can’t explain how math works before any experience since they don’t have a real, clear way to understand space and time at first.

Our own theory fixes these problems by explaining how space and time really work as the way we sense things. Also, the only two basic parts of how we sense the world are space and time. Other ideas, like movement, depend on experience because something has to be moving in space, and space itself doesn’t move. The same is true for change: time doesn’t change, only things inside time do, and we need experience to notice that.

In short, space and time are real but only as the way we see and feel things, not as things that exist completely on their own.
