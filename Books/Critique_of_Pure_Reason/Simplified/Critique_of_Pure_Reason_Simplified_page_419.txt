Part II, Division II, Book I talks about three groups of ideas. The first group is about the absolute unity of the thinking subject (your mind). The second group is about the absolute unity of the series of conditions that make things appear. The third group is about the absolute unity of the condition that makes all objects of thought possible.

The thinking subject (your mind) is what psychology studies. The whole world, which is all appearances, is what cosmology studies. And the ultimate condition that allows anything to be thought at all (like the existence of everything) is what theology studies. So, pure reason gives ideas for a special kind of soul science called rational psychology, a science of the world called rational cosmology, and a knowledge of God called transcendental theology.

Even just a rough idea of these sciences isn’t something the understanding (logic and reason) tells us to do on its own. It comes purely from reason itself, not from experience or the usual way we think about things. This project is a pure idea created by reason alone.

The kinds of pure rational ideas under these three titles will be explained later.

These ideas follow the same path as the categories (basic concepts). Pure reason never deals directly with objects but instead works with concepts given by the understanding. It will become clear how reason, by using the same logical methods it uses in syllogisms (a kind of logical argument), must come to the idea of the absolute unity of the thinking subject.

Also, how logical steps in hypothetical syllogisms lead to the idea of something absolutely unconditioned in a series of given conditions. Finally, how the form of the disjunctive syllogism (a type of logical choice) leads to the highest idea of a being that contains all beings – a thought that seems very strange at first.

We can’t really prove these transcendental ideas like we can prove categories. Because they are ideas, they don’t actually relate to any object that matches them exactly. But we can still introduce these ideas subjectively to rational psychology, rational cosmology, and transcendental theology.
