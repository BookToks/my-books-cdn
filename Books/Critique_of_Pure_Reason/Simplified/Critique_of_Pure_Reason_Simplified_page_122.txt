They comprehended that reason has insight only into what it it­ self produces according to its own design; that it must take the lead with principlesa for its judgments according to constant laws and compel na­ ture to answer its questions, rather than letting nature guide its move­ ments by keeping reason, as it were, in leading-strings; for otherwise accidental observations, made according to no previously designed plan, can never connect up into a necessary law, which is yet what rea­ son seeks and requires. Reason, in order to be taught by nature, must approach nature with its principlesb in one hand, according to which alone the agreement among appearances can count as laws, and, in the other hand, the experiments thought out in accordance with these prin­ ciplesc-yet in order to be instructed by nature not like a pupil, who has recited to him whatever the teacher wants to say, but like an appointed judge who compels witnesses to answer the questions he puts to them.
 
 Thus even physics owes the advantageous revolution in its way of thinking to the inspiration that what reason would not be able to know of it- BXlV self and has to learn from nature, it has to seek in the latter (though not merely ascribe to it) in accordance with what reason itself puts into nature. This is how natural science was first brought to the secure course of a science after groping about for so many centuries.
 
 Metaphysics -a wholly isolated speculative cognition of reason that elevates itself entirely above all instruction from experience, and that through mere concepts (not, like mathematics, through the application of concepts to intuition), where reason thus is supposed to be its own pupil -has up to now not been so favored by fate as to have been able to enter upon the secure course of a science, even though it is older than all other sciences, and would remain even if all the others were swal­ lowed up by an all-consuming barbarism. For in it reason continuously gets stuck, even when it claims a priori insight (as it pretends) into those laws confirmed by the commonest experience. In metaphysics we have to retrace our path countless times, because we find that it does not lead where we want to go, and it is so far from reaching unanimity in the as- BXV sertions of its adherents that it is rather a battlefield, and indeed one that appears to be especially determined for testing one's powers in mock combat; on this battlefield no combatant has ever gained the least * Here I am not following exactly the thread of the history of the experimental B xiii method, whose first beginnings are also not precisely known.
