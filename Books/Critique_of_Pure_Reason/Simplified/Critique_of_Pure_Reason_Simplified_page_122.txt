They understood that reason can only understand things it creates itself, following its own plan. Reason has to lead with basic rules when making judgments and force nature to answer its questions, instead of just following nature like a child on a leash. If we only make random observations without a plan, we can’t find the necessary laws that reason wants and needs.

Reason must approach nature with its own rules in one hand, which help decide what counts as a law, and experiments planned according to these rules in the other hand. But reason isn’t like a student just listening to a teacher; it’s like a judge who makes witnesses answer the questions it asks.

Because of this, even physics changed for the better. It realized that what reason can’t figure out on its own, it must learn from nature—but only by looking for what reason itself expects in nature, not just guessing. This is how natural science finally became a solid science after many centuries of trying.

Metaphysics is different. It’s a kind of thinking where reason tries to work alone, without learning from experience, using only ideas—not like math, which uses ideas with real examples. Reason tries to teach itself in metaphysics, but it hasn’t been lucky enough to become a solid science, even though it’s older than all other sciences and would still exist if all others disappeared.

In metaphysics, reason often gets stuck, even when it claims to know things without experience. We have to go back again and again because it doesn’t lead where we want. Instead of agreement, metaphysics is like a battlefield where people argue a lot but no one ever really wins or keeps their ground.
