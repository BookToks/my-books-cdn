So, we will carefully look at all the ideas about the soul’s nature, but to keep it short, we’ll explain them all at once.

First, some general comments can help you understand this way of thinking better. I don’t know any object just because I’m thinking. Instead, I only know an object when I focus on a certain idea connected to how my mind stays aware of itself while thinking.

This means I don’t know myself just by noticing that I’m thinking. I only know myself when I’m aware of the idea of myself as it relates to the act of thinking.

All kinds of self-awareness while thinking are not actually concepts about objects. They are just functions that don’t give us any object to know, so they don’t show me myself as something to understand.

What matters is not being aware of the self that controls thinking, but being aware of the self as something that can be understood—the inner idea of myself, as long as its parts can be connected according to how my mind keeps itself unified in thought.

In every judgment I make, I am always the one who decides or determines.
