Kant thought that using God as the reason why anything is possible made more sense logically than some other arguments about God's existence. But in his book, the Critique of Pure Reason, he ended up rejecting those traditional arguments. Instead, he said we can only believe in God’s existence and qualities because of moral reasons, not because of pure logic or facts. Even so, Kant had an important idea: just because a concept doesn’t contradict itself doesn’t mean it’s really possible. It needs some real connection to actual existence. This idea was very important in both his theoretical and practical philosophy.

The second main part of Kant’s work, The Only Possible Basis, shows that he was interested early on in figuring out what scientific laws really are. It also reveals that his complex ideas about teleology—how things have purposes or final causes—were part of his thinking for a long time. He didn’t just add these ideas later. During a debate about how the world works, Kant argued that God’s purposes are shown through natural laws that never change, rather than through miracles or random events. He said that if nature follows these strict laws, God doesn’t need to step in to fix things because bad things wouldn’t happen in the first place.

Kant also believed that when studying causes and effects, we should try to see nature as one united system without breaking it up. He thought that having true knowledge of the world means understanding events as part of cause-and-effect laws. And knowing these laws means thinking of them as part of a system that, even if not actually made by God, is like it was created by a super-smart being—kind of like God but more powerful than us.
