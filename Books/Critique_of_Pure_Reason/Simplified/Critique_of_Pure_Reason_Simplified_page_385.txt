Part II, Division I, Book II, Appendix talks about a way of understanding the world. It explains how someone thought they could understand the true nature of things just by comparing ideas and using their mind, without needing to look at the actual things themselves.

Our chart of different ideas helps us see what makes this way of thinking unique and where it goes wrong. This person only compared things using concepts in their mind and found differences only based on how the mind separates ideas. They didn’t pay attention to how our senses give us real information with their own unique differences. For them, senses were just a messy kind of mental picture, not a special way we get information. They thought what we see is just a picture of the real thing, even though it’s different from how the mind logically understands things. Basically, Leibniz made appearances into something intellectual, while Locke did the opposite—he made ideas all about what we sense. Each of these thinkers believed only one source of knowledge mattered and that the other source just messed up or helped organize what the first gave.

Leibniz compared things we sense by thinking about them as general ideas, judging whether they are the same or different with his mind alone.

Because he only looked at the ideas and ignored where they come from in actual experience, he confused concepts about things in general with actual sensory objects. This led him to wrongly apply his rule that no two things can be exactly alike to the world we sense, and he thought this gave him a big advantage in understanding nature.
