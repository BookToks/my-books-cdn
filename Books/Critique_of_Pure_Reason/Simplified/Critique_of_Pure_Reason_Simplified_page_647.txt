Appearances, space, and time, and the idea of these as tiny parts called quanta, can be understood beforehand through pure intuition. This means we can imagine or build them in our minds, along with their shape or just their amount using numbers. But the actual stuff we see in space and time can only be known through experience, not just by thinking. The only idea we have before experience that relates to what we see is the idea of a "thing" in general. Knowing this idea can't give us more than a rule about how to combine what we learn from experience. It can’t show us the real thing itself because that must be learned through experience.

Some statements about things in general, which we can’t imagine beforehand, are called transcendental. These statements can’t be made just by thinking about ideas but only by using ideas that come before experience. They only give rules about how to look for things we can’t imagine before seeing. But they never show us any specific ideas before experience; we only get those from experience, which is possible thanks to these rules.

If we want to say something new about an idea, we have to go beyond just the idea itself and look at the actual thing we know through experience or imagination. If we stay only with the idea, then we are just explaining what is already in our mind, which is called an analytic judgment. But if we connect the idea to a real or imagined example, we can learn new things either beforehand (rational and mathematical knowledge) or from experience (which is not absolutely certain). For example, thinking about gold just by its idea lets me list what I know about it, but doesn’t really add new knowledge. However, if I look at actual gold and notice things, I can get new knowledge from experience. If I imagine a triangle, I can know new things by mentally building it, which is a kind of certain, logical knowledge. But if I think about big ideas like reality, substance, or force, they don’t point to any real or imagined thing by themselves. They just help us combine what we experience, and since this can’t be done before experience, they only give us principles, not specific knowledge.
