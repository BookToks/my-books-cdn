E. Conrad, H. P. Delfosse, and B. Nehren (Hamburg: Felix Meiner, 1990).

The main sources are notes in Kant’s copy of Baumgarten’s Metaphysica, which was the base for his metaphysics class. These notes were first copied by Benno Erdmann in a book from 1884, then by Erich Adickes in volumes published in 1926 and 1928. These notes cover Kant’s thoughts from the 1770s. Adickes’s version also has some loose papers that tell us even more than the notes in the margins of the book. The most important of these come from a group called the Duisburg Nachlass, named after a 19th-century owner. The notes from this group about the Critique are found in certain pages of Adickes’s edition. There is no proof that Kant kept all his notes during his life, and many papers may have been lost after he died in 1804. So, the information we have about the 1770s is incomplete.

Kant finally published the Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals in 1785. Later, in 1797, he published The Metaphysics of Morals, which explains political and moral duties in more detail.

There are letters from 1770 that help us understand Kant’s thinking. For example, letter 57 from September 2, 1770, and letters 61, 62, and 63 from October to December 1770, show his discussions with other thinkers. Translations of some of these letters appear in a book by Zweig.

Other letters from Kant are numbered and referenced with pages from Zweig’s book. These letters show how Kant’s ideas developed over time. For instance, a letter to Herz from February 1772 and later ones show Kant’s changing tone and thoughts.

In one letter, Kant thanks Herz for sending a copy of an essay on taste but apologizes for not talking about some points because he can’t remember who borrowed the book.

Overall, these letters and notes give us a glimpse into Kant’s work and life during the 1770s, but many details remain missing.
