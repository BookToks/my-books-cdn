 99 The primary sources are notes in Kant's copy of Baumgarten's Meta­ physica, which was the basis for his course on metaphysics, that were tran­ scribed first by Benno Erdmann in Reftexionen Kants zur Kritik der reine n Vernunft (Leipzig: Fues, 1884) and then by Erich Adickes in volumes 17 and 18 of the Akademie edition, which first appeared in 1926 and 1928 (Reflections 4273-5635 in Adickes's numbering, plus a few subsequent ones, cover the period of the 177os). Adickes's edition also includes a number of loose sheets or drafts which tend to be more informative than the marginalia. The most important of these come from the so-called Duisburg Nachlafl, named after a nineteenth-century owner; the material from this group pertaining to the development of the Critique is found in Reflections 4674-84 in the Akademie edition. There is no evidence that Kant preserved all his notes at any time in his life, and many papers that did survive the remainder of his life after the publication of the Critique may have been dispersed upon his death in 1804 and thereafter lost. So our information about the 1770s remains fragmentary.
 
 100 Kant was finally to publish the Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals in 1785, and the work actually entitled The Metaphysics of Morals, his detailed exposition of political and moral duties, not until 1797.
