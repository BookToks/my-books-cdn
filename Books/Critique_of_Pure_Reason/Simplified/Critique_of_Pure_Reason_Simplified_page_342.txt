Systematic representation of all synthetic principles putative experience is not mere imagination must be ascertained ac­ cording to its particular determinations and through its coherence with the criteria of all actual experience.
 
 aFinally, as far as the third postulate is concerned, it pertains to material A226 necessity in existence, not the merely formal and logical necessity in the connection of concepts.88 Now since no existenceb of objects of the senses can be cognized fully a priori, but always only comparatively a priori relative to another already given existence, but since nevertheless A227 even then we can only arrive at an existence that must be contained somewhere in the nexus of experience of which the given perception is a part, the necessity of existenced can thus never be cognized from concepts but rather always only from the connection with that which is perceived, in accordance with general laws of experience. Now there is no existence that could be cognized as necessary under the condition of other given appearances except the existence of effects from given causes in accordance with laws of causality. Thus it is not the existence of things (substances) but of their state of which alone we can cognize the necessity, and moreover only from other states, which are given in B 280 perception, in accordance with empirical laws of causality. From this it follows that the criterion of necessity lies solely in the law of possible ex­ perience that everything that happens is determined a priori through its cause in appearance. Hence we cognize only the necessity of effects in nature, the causes of which are given to us, and the mark of necessity in existence does not reach beyond the field of possible experience, and even in this it does not hold of the existence' of things, as substances, since these can never be regarded as empirical effects, or as something that happens and arises. Necessity therefore concerns only the relations of appearances in accordance with the dynamical law of causality, and A228 the possibility grounded upon it of inferring a priori from some given existence (a cause) to another existence (the effect). Everything that happens is hypothetically necessary; that is a principle that subjects alteration in the world to a law, i.e., a rule of necessary existence, without which not even nature itself would obtain. Hence the proposition "Nothing happens through a mere accident" (in mundo non datur casus)!
