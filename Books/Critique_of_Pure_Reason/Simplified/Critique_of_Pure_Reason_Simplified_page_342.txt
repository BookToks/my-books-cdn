All ideas about how things happen must be checked carefully by real experiences, not just by imagining them. We have to make sure they fit with what we actually see and learn.

The third rule talks about real reasons why things exist, not just how ideas connect logically. We can’t know for sure that something exists just by thinking about it; we always have to compare it to something else we already know exists. 

Even then, we only understand something exists because it fits into what we experience. We don’t figure out necessity (what must happen) from ideas alone, but from how things we see connect following the rules of experience. 

The only thing we can say definitely must happen is that effects come from causes, following the rule of cause and effect. It’s not that objects or things themselves must exist in a certain way, but their states or conditions must follow from other states we observe, based on these rules. 

So, the idea of something being necessary comes only from the rule that everything that happens has a cause. We only know that effects in nature must happen because their causes exist. This rule doesn’t apply to things themselves as objects, since they don’t just come into existence or change like events do. 

Necessity is only about how things appear and change according to cause and effect. Because of this, if we know one thing (a cause), we can predict another thing (an effect) must happen. Everything that changes in the world follows this rule, which means nothing happens by pure chance. Nature always follows these laws, so "nothing happens by accident."
