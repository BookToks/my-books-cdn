The idea that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line is something we know by experience, not just by thinking about the words. When we think about a straight line, we don’t automatically think about how short it is. So, knowing it’s the shortest distance comes from our intuition, not just from the idea of a straight line itself.

Some basic rules in geometry are different because they are true by definition and don’t need experience to prove them. For example, something is always equal to itself, or the whole is always bigger than a part of it. Even though these ideas come from pure thinking, they are accepted in math because we can also see them clearly through intuition. Sometimes, it seems like these truths are obvious just from the idea itself, but that’s because of how we say things. What really matters is what we actually think, and for these truths, we need to add intuition to our ideas.

In natural science, there are also truths that we know without needing to check every time, like the fact that matter doesn’t change in amount during any change, or that forces always come in equal pairs. These ideas are not just from the definition of matter or motion but go beyond that. We add new information to our concepts by understanding them through intuition before any experience.

So, these truths are not just about analyzing ideas but are new knowledge we get on their own, without experience. The same idea applies to metaphysics, which tries to learn about things beyond what we can see or touch. It uses this kind of knowledge to go further than what experience alone can show us.
