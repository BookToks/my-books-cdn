People often assume too quickly that just because they think of something, it must actually exist. But this idea is supported by another reason: when we look for the cause of things that depend on something else, we eventually have to find something that doesn’t depend on anything—something unconditioned.

This is how human thinking usually works, even if not everyone follows it all the way. It starts with what we experience every day, which is real. But that only works if there is something solid and unchanging to rely on. Otherwise, everything would be unstable, like floating in empty space, unless that solid thing is infinite and fills everything, leaving no room for anything else.

If anything exists at all, then something must exist necessarily. Things that happen by chance depend on other causes. Following this logic back, we reach a cause that doesn’t depend on anything else—it exists out of necessity. This is the reason we search for a being that must exist absolutely, not just because we can think of it, but because it fits the idea of something that can’t not exist.

Reason tries to find which concept matches this necessary being. It doesn’t try to prove it exists just by thinking, but to find a concept that doesn’t conflict with being necessary. If it can rule out all concepts except one, then that one must be the absolutely necessary being, whether or not we fully understand why it has to exist.

The concept that answers every "why" is the one that is complete, perfect, and needs nothing else to explain it. This is the being that fits the idea of being absolutely necessary, because it doesn’t depend on anything and can’t be incomplete. No other idea meets this condition.
