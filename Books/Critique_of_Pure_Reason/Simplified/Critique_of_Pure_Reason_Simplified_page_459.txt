Part 2, Division 2, Book 2, Chapter 1

When I say "I think," the "I" that does the thinking is always the subject, and it doesn’t just depend on the act of thinking to exist. This is definitely true and can’t be denied. But that doesn’t mean this "I" is a separate, independent thing all by itself.

Saying that would be a big claim. It would need proof that we can’t find just by thinking. So, if I only think about what it means to think, I might be asking for more than I can ever actually find.

Second, the "I" that is aware of thinking is always one single thing. It can’t be split into many different subjects. This idea is already part of what it means to think, so it’s true just by definition. But that doesn’t mean this "I" is a simple substance like a physical thing. The idea of substance usually relates to things we can sense, and since thinking happens in our understanding (which isn’t about sensing), this doesn’t apply here.

It would be surprising if something that needs so much careful thinking about what substances are and how they relate to what we sense would be so obvious and clear just by thinking alone.

Third, the idea that I am the same person in all my different thoughts is also true by definition. But this doesn’t mean I am the same in a physical or personal way through all my experiences. That kind of identity needs more than just thinking—it needs things we can sense or experience.

Fourth, I can tell the difference between my own existence as a thinker and other things outside me, like my body. This is also true by definition because other things are what I think are separate from me. But I don’t actually know if I could be aware of myself at all without things outside me that give me ideas. So, I’m not sure if I could exist just as a thinking being without being a human.

So, just analyzing how I’m aware of myself while thinking doesn’t really help me understand myself as an object or thing.
