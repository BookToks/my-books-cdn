The question is whether we can use understanding beyond just what we experience through our senses, like in Newton's view of the universe, to know things as they really are. We have said that this is not possible.

If we say that our senses show us objects as they appear, but our understanding shows them as they are, then the understanding should be used only in an empirical way. This means it shows how things must be understood as part of our experiences, not how they might be outside of any experience or sense. Things as they are on their own, without our senses, remain unknown to us. We don’t even know if it’s possible to understand things that way. For us, understanding and senses always work together. If we separate them, we only get ideas without real images or images without ideas, and these don’t help us connect to any real object.

If someone still doubts that we can’t use understanding in a purely transcendental way, they should try testing it with a synthetic statement. An analytic statement only works within what we already think about a concept, and it doesn’t tell us if the concept applies to real objects or just to thinking itself. What matters is what the concept means, not whether it relates to something real. So, they should test understanding with a synthetic idea that goes beyond experience, like "Everything that exists is a substance or depends on a substance," or "Every event has a cause."

Now the question is: where do these synthetic ideas come from if they are supposed to apply to things as they are in themselves, not just to what we can experience? What is the third thing that connects ideas that don’t logically fit together? They won’t be able to prove these statements or even explain how they could be true without relying on experience. This means they can’t use pure understanding alone to make such claims.
