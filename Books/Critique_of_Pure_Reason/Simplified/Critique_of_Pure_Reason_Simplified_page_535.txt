Part II, Division II, Book II, Chapter II

The difference between something infinite and something that goes on without a set end is kind of a small detail. For example, if you say, "Draw a line," it sounds better to say "draw it as far as you want" rather than "draw it forever without stopping." The first just means you can make it longer if you want, but the second means you should never stop, which is not the point here.

When we talk about what can actually be done, the first way is totally fine because you could always keep making it longer, even to infinity. This idea works for any situation where you’re moving forward in a series, like going from one condition to the next.

For example, from one pair of parents, you could keep tracing their descendants forever. You can even imagine that this could really happen in the world. Here, reason doesn’t need a complete end to the series because it’s not starting with a fixed whole; instead, it adds on parts that can keep going without stopping.

But it’s different when you try to go backward from something given to its causes or conditions. The question is whether this backward chain goes on forever or just goes on without a set end. For example, can you trace human ancestors back infinitely, or only as far as you’ve looked, with no proof that it really goes on forever? You can keep searching for more ancestors, but you can’t assume they must exist without proof.

Here’s my answer: If you had the entire thing in front of you, you could say the backward chain goes to infinity. But if you only have one part of the series, and you want to find all its causes, then the backward chain just goes on without a set end.  

For example, if you look at a piece of matter inside certain limits, you can say it goes to infinity because the whole thing is given to you as it really is, including all its parts. Each part is made of smaller parts, and those parts are made of even smaller parts, and so on.

Since you never find a smallest indivisible part, this breaking down process goes on forever.
