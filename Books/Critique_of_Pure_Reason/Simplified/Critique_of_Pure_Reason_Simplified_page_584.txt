We won’t look at it just yet. Instead, we’ll explain one trick it uses. It takes an old argument, dresses it up to look new, and pretends that two different kinds of proof agree with each other. One proof is all about pure reason, and the other is based on experience. But actually, only the pure reason proof is there, just pretending to be two by changing its form.

This proof tries to base itself on experience to seem different from the ontological proof, which only uses pure ideas without any experience. But the cosmological proof only uses experience for one step: to show that a necessary being exists in general.

What this necessary being is like, the experience part can’t explain. So reason gives up on experience and goes back to thinking about ideas. It asks what properties a necessary being must have, meaning what conditions make something absolutely necessary. Reason thinks it finds these conditions only in the idea of the most real being, so it concludes that this being is the absolutely necessary one.

But here, it assumes that the idea of the most real being automatically means it must exist. This was the main point of the ontological proof, which the cosmological proof secretly uses even though it said it wouldn’t. Absolute necessity means existing just because of the idea itself.

If I say the idea of the most real being fits perfectly with necessary existence, then I have to admit that this existence can be concluded from the idea alone. So really, the cosmological proof just depends on the ontological proof’s power.

Experience doesn’t add anything important—it might only help us come up with the idea of a necessary being, but it can’t prove that this idea matches any real thing. As soon as we want to connect the idea to a real thing, we have to stop using experience and look only at pure ideas to find if one includes the conditions for an absolutely necessary being.

If we can see that such a being is possible in this way, then its existence is also proven. That means among all possible things, there is one that must exist by its very nature. All hidden tricks in these arguments become clear when you think about the “most real being.”
