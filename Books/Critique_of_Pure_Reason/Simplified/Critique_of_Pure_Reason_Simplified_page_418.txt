Transcendental ideas are a system that includes all conditions, even though we can never fully understand them. The whole system must be completely true if the things that depend on it are true. Reason demands this because it says that what we know must be necessary and decided before experience—either it’s true by itself or it comes from a series of truths that are definitely true.

The first book of the transcendental dialectic, Third section: The system of transcendental ideas.

Here, we’re not just talking about a simple logical argument that ignores what we actually know and only finds mistakes in reasoning. Instead, this is a transcendental dialectic, which is based entirely on reason. It explains where some ideas come from that we can’t learn from experience and that go beyond what our understanding can handle.

We know from how reason works that there are three kinds of reasoning that help us get knowledge from basic principles. Reason always tries to move from things that depend on something else to something that doesn’t depend on anything—the unconditioned—which our understanding can’t fully reach.

Every way our thoughts relate to things has three parts: 1) how they relate to the thinker, 2) how they relate to objects, either as things we see or as general ideas. When we put this together with the three types of reasoning, all relations in our thoughts are about 1) ourselves, 2) the different parts of objects we see, and 3) all things in general.

All pure concepts deal with combining different ideas, but pure reason (transcendental ideas) deals with combining all conditions without limits. So, all transcendental ideas fit under certain principles and relate to objects in a special way.
