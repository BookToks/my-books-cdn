Imagine someone who messed up the base of their house. You could say they should have known from the start that the house would fall down—they didn’t have to actually see it collapse to figure that out. But actually, they couldn’t have totally known this without some experience. For example, they had to learn first that heavy things fall when their support is taken away.

So, when we talk about "a priori" knowledge, we mean knowledge that doesn’t come from any experience at all. This is different from "empirical" knowledge, which you get only after experiencing something. Among a priori knowledge, some are called "pure" because they don’t mix in anything learned from experience. For example, the idea that "Every change has a cause" is a kind of a priori knowledge, but not pure, since the idea of change comes from experience.

We all have some a priori knowledge, even just regular people.

The question is: how can we tell pure knowledge apart from experience-based knowledge? Experience can show us how things usually are, but it can’t prove that things couldn’t be any different. First, if an idea is thought along with the fact that it has to be true, it is an a priori judgment. If it is also not based on any other idea except one that is necessarily true, then it is completely a priori. Second, experience only gives us ideas that seem true most of the time, but never absolutely. For example, we say "All bodies are heavy" because we’ve seen no exceptions, but that’s not absolutely certain. If a judgment is thought to be true without any exceptions at all, then it’s not from experience but is absolutely a priori.

So, experience-based knowledge is just a guess that something always happens because it happens most of the time. But knowledge that is absolutely true and without exceptions comes from a special ability to understand things a priori. Being necessary and absolutely true without exceptions are sure signs that the knowledge is a priori, and these two things always go together.
