If we watch people and try to understand why they do things by looking at their bodies and how they work, like in anthropology, we can learn a lot.

But if we think about the same actions with reason—not just thinking about where they come from, but how reason itself makes people do things—we see a different kind of order. Nature might make things happen in a certain way, but that doesn’t mean they had to happen that way. Sometimes, it seems like people’s actions happen because of their ideas and choices, not just because of natural causes.

Now, imagine if reason can actually cause things to happen. Could that mean reason is free, even if everything around us seems determined and necessary? The way things look to us (empirical) is connected to how they are in our minds (intelligible), but we don’t fully understand that part. We only see the results through our senses. When actions come from reason, they don’t follow natural laws like cause and effect in time. Reason isn’t limited by time, so its influence doesn’t happen at a specific moment.

If reason worked like natural causes in time, it would just be another part of nature’s rules. But it’s not. This means the real meaning of our actions, like whether they are right or wrong, is hidden from us. We can only judge actions based on what we see and experience. We don’t really know how much of what we do is because of nature, personality, or luck, so we can’t judge people perfectly or fairly.
