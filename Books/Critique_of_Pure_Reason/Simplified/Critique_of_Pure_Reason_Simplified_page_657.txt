Chapter 1, Section 2: Foreign Claims

When I talk about using pure reason in arguments, I mean defending ideas against people who completely deny them without proof. The point isn’t whether our ideas might be wrong, but that no one can prove the exact opposite for sure or even make it seem more likely. So, if we have a reason to believe something, even if it’s not perfect, no one can prove that believing it is wrong.

It’s upsetting and confusing that pure reason, which should be the final judge in all arguments, can still argue with itself. Earlier, we saw an example of this problem. But that problem came from misunderstanding—people mixed up how things seem with how things really are, and expected a perfect answer that’s impossible when dealing with appearances. So, there was no real contradiction in saying “The series of appearances has a first beginning” and “This series has no beginning.” Both can be true because appearances themselves don’t really exist on their own, so it makes sense that the ideas conflict.

However, this kind of misunderstanding doesn’t explain all conflicts in reason. For example, some people say, “There is a highest being” (theistic view), while others say, “There is no highest being” (atheistic view). Or in psychology, one might say, “Everything that thinks is a constant, unchanging unity,” while someone else says, “The soul isn’t unchanging and is affected by material changes.” These questions are about things themselves, not just appearances, so the conflict is real.

There would definitely be a real conflict if pure reason could prove the negative side strongly enough. But when it comes to criticizing proofs for strong positive claims, we can accept that the opponent’s arguments weaken those claims. Still, these claims have some interest and support from reason, and the opponent can’t just ignore them.
