Ch. I. Sec. II foreign pretensions, even though it cannot itself be sufficiently proved xm:' aA�8ELav. a Now by the polemical use of pure reason I understand the defense of its propositions against dogmatic denials of them. Here the issue is not whether its own assertions might perhaps also be false, but only that no A740/B768 one can ever assert the opposite with apodictic certainty (or even only with greater plausibility). For in this case we do not hold our possession merely by sufferance if we have a title to it, even if not a sufficient one, and it is completely certain that no one can ever prove the unlawfulness of this possession.
 
 It is worrisome and depressing that there should be an antithetic of pure reason at all, and that pure reason, though it represents the supreme court of justice for all disputes, should still come into conflict with itself. We had such an apparent antithetic of reason before us above, '3 to be sure, but it turned out that it rested on a misunderstand­ ing, namely that of taking, in accord with common prejudice, appear­ ances for things in themselves, and then demanding an absolute completeness in their synthesis, in one or another way (which were both equally impossible), which could hardly be expected in the case of appearances. There was thus in that case no real contradiction of rea­ son with itself in the propositions "The series of appearances given in themselves has an absolutely first beginning" and "This series is ab­ solutely and in itself without any beginning"; for both propositions are quite compatible, since appearances, as regards their existence (as ap­ pearances) in themselves are nothing at all, i.e., something contra­ dictory, and thus their presupposition must naturally be followed by contradictory consequences.
 
 A 741/ B 769 However, such a misunderstanding cannot be alleged and the conflict of reason thereby set aside if, say, it is asserted theistically There is a highest being and asserted atheistically, on the contrary, There is no highest being, or when it is asserted, in psychology, "Everything that thinks is of absolutely persistent unity and therefore distinct from all transitory material unity," against which someone else asserts, "The soul is not an immaterial unity and cannot be exempted from all transi­ toriness." For the object of the question is here free of anything foreign that contradicts its nature, and the understanding is concerned only with things in themselves and not with appearances. There would thus certainly be a genuine conflict here, if only pure reason had any­ thing to say on the negative side that would approximate the ground for an assertion; for as far as the critique of the grounds of proof of the dog­ matic affirmations is concerned, one can very well concede it without a according to the truth 644 The discipline of pure reason in polemical use thereby giving up these propositions, which still have at least the inter­ est of reason in their behalf, to which the opponent cannot appeal at all.
