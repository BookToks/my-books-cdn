Part II, Division II: Transcendental Dialectic, taken from experience by induction, can be used as the main idea in a logical argument, but that doesn’t mean it is itself a principle. 

Mathematical rules, like the idea that there can only be one straight line between two points, are universal truths we understand without experience. So, these rules can be called principles when we apply them to specific cases. But I don’t learn these rules from principles; instead, I understand them through pure intuition.

I would call "knowing from principles" the process where I understand a specific thing by connecting it to a general idea through concepts. Every logical argument is a way of getting knowledge from a principle.

The main idea in an argument always gives a general concept, so anything that fits under it can be understood based on that principle. Since all general knowledge can be the main idea in an argument, and since our mind creates these general ideas before experience, these ideas can be called principles for how they might be used.

But if we look at these principles of pure understanding by themselves, they don’t actually come from concepts. They wouldn’t be possible without pure intuition (like in math) or the basic conditions needed for any experience. For example, the idea that everything that happens has a cause can’t be figured out just by thinking about what happens; instead, this principle helps us understand how to get clear ideas from experience.

So, the mind can’t create new knowledge by just using concepts alone. The true principles, which give new knowledge, are not from concepts. Still, all general statements can be called principles in a relative way.

People have long hoped that instead of having endless civil laws, we could find the basic principles behind them. That would make laws simpler. But laws limit our freedom only in ways that agree with ourselves because they apply to things we create and control through concepts. The idea that things in the world should follow principles based only on concepts is strange and maybe even impossible. Sometimes this is called an "inference of reason," and it will be explained more later.
