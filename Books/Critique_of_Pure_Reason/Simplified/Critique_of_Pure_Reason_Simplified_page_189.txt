Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic  
§ 3 Explanation of the idea of space.

By "transcendental exposition," I mean explaining a concept in a way that helps us understand how we can know things that go beyond just definitions. To do this, two things are needed: 1) we must actually get new knowledge from the concept, and 2) this new knowledge can only happen if we explain the concept in a certain way.

Geometry is the study that tells us about space in a way that is both based on experience and also certain without needing experience. So, what kind of idea of space do we need to make this kind of knowledge possible? It has to be a direct way of seeing or feeling space, called intuition. This is because just having a concept can’t give us new information beyond the concept itself, but geometry does that.

This intuition has to be "pure," meaning it comes before we experience any objects. It’s not based on actual things we see or feel but exists in our minds beforehand.

Geometrical statements are always definitely true and necessary, like "space has three dimensions." These statements can’t just come from experience or guesses based on experience.

Now, how can we have this kind of intuition about space before seeing any objects? It can only happen because this intuition is built into us, as the way our mind is set up to receive information from outside things. This means space exists as the way we sense the outside world, before we even think about particular objects.

This explanation shows why geometry can give us certain knowledge that goes beyond experience. Any other explanation that doesn’t do this can be easily told apart.

From this, we can conclude:

a) Space is not a property of things themselves or how they relate to each other. It’s not something that objects have on their own, even if we try to ignore how we perceive them. We can’t know space before the things exist, so space is not something that exists independently of us.
