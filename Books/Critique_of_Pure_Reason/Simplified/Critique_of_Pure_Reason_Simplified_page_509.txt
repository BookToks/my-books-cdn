Now we have the full story of big ideas about the universe. These ideas don’t match anything we can actually experience, and reason itself can’t fully agree with the usual rules of experience. But these ideas weren’t made up randomly. Instead, reason naturally comes to them when it tries to understand everything without limits, even though we can only ever know things based on certain conditions.

These tricky ideas are just different ways to try to solve four natural problems that reason always faces. There can only be these four problems—no more, no less—because there are no other starting points that shape how we understand experience.

We have shown how reason tries to go beyond the limits of what we can experience, using clear and simple statements that explain why reason makes these claims. Since this is a deep kind of philosophy, we took out anything based on actual experience, even though reason’s full power can only be seen when mixed with experience. But as reason starts with what we can experience and then slowly reaches for these big ideas, philosophy shows such importance that if it could prove its ideas, it would be more valuable than any other science. This is because it promises to explain our biggest hopes and what everything really means.

Questions like: Does the world have a beginning? Does it have an edge in space? Is there something inside me that can’t be broken or divided? Or is everything just made up of parts that can disappear? Are my choices really free, or are they controlled like everything else by nature and fate? Is there a highest cause behind everything, or is nature itself the final answer? These are questions so deep that even mathematicians would give up their entire field to find answers. Math can’t help with these biggest questions about life and meaning, no matter how proud it is of itself.
