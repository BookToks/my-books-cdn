Now we have before us the entire dialectical play of the cosmological ideas, which do not permit an object congruent to them to be given in any possible experience, which, indeed, do not even permit reason to think them in agreement with the universal laws of experience, but which have not been thought up arbitrarily; reason, rather, in continu­ ous progression of the empirical synthesis, has been led to them neces­ sarily when it tries to liberate from every condition, and to grasp in its unconditioned totality, that which can always be determined only conditionally in accordance with rules of experience. These sophistical a assertions are only so many attempts to solve four natural and unavoid­ able problems of reason; there can be only so many of them, no more and no less, because there are no more series of synthetic presupposi­ tions that bound the empirical synthesis a priori.
 
 We have represented the glittering pretensions of reason to extend its territory beyond all the bounds of experience only in dry formulas, A463iB491 which contain merely the ground of reason's legal claims; and, as is fit­ ting for a transcendental philosophy, we have divested these claims of everything empirical, even though the full splendor of reason's asser­ tions can shine forth only in such a combination. But in this application, and in the progressive extension of the use of reason, since it com­ mences with the field of experience and only gradually soars aloft to these sublime ideas, philosophy exhibits such a dignity that, if it could only assert its pretensions, it would leave every other human science far behind in value, since it would promise to ground our greatest expecta­ tions and prospects concerning the ultimate ends in which all reason's efforts must finally unite. The questions whether the world has a be­ ginning and its extension in space a boundary; whether there is any­ where, perhaps in my thinking self, an indivisible and indestructible unity, or whether there is nothing but that which is divisible and per­ ishable; whether my actions are free or, like those of other beings, con­ trolled by the strings of nature and fate; whether, finally, there is a supreme cause of the world, or whether natural things and their order constitute the ultimate object, at which all our consideration of things must stop -these are questions for whose solution the mathematician would gladly give up his entire science; for that science cannot give him A464i B 492 any satisfaction in regard to the highest and most important ends of hu­ manity. Even the proper dignity of mathematics (that pride of human vernunftelnden a 496 Section III.
