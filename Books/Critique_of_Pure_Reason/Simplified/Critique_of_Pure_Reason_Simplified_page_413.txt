When I say "Caius is mortal," I understand this because I relate the idea of being mortal to Caius.

In a syllogism, we limit a statement about something (like "B") to a specific object after thinking about it more generally in the first part. This broad idea about all possible cases is called universality. When we combine ideas in our mind, this is like thinking about everything involved, which is called totality of conditions.

The main idea of reason is about understanding all the conditions that affect something. Only something that is unconditioned (not depending on anything else) can explain all these conditions. So, a pure idea of reason comes from thinking about the unconditioned, which helps us understand what depends on other things.

There are different kinds of reason based on how we relate ideas: one about a subject, one about a series of causes, and one about parts of a system. Each kind leads us to an unconditioned end: a subject that is just itself, a first cause that needs nothing before it, and a complete group that finishes a division of ideas.

These pure ideas of total conditions are important because they help us try to fully understand things without contradictions. Even if these ideas don’t always work perfectly in real life, they guide our thinking so it stays clear and consistent when we push it to its limits.

But when we talk about the total conditions and the unconditioned, we face a tricky word: "absolute." This word used to mean one clear thing, but over time it got used in confusing ways. Losing the true meaning of "absolute" means losing the clear idea it represented, and that’s a problem because this idea is very important for understanding reason.
