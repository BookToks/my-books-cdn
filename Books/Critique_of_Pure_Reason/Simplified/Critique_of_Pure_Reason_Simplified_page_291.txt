Now our job is to show, in a clear and organized way, the judgments that the understanding makes before any experience, keeping in mind an important warning. Our list of categories will definitely help guide us safely.

These categories are important because their connection to possible experiences makes all pure understanding before experience possible. Their link to our senses will also explain all the basic rules about how we use understanding, fully and in a system.

A priori principles are called that not just because they explain other judgments, but because they don’t depend on any higher or more general knowledge. But this doesn’t mean they don’t need proof. Even though they can’t be proven objectively beyond a certain point, they still need proof based on how we can understand objects at all. Without this, the idea would seem very suspicious and like a hidden assumption.

Finally, we will only focus on the principles that really relate to objects.
