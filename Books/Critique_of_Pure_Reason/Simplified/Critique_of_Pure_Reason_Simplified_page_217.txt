We can never be sure exactly where this investigation will end if we just follow a mechanical process. Also, the ideas we come up with only when the chance appears won’t show any clear order or unity. Instead, they will be grouped in pairs based on how similar they are and arranged in a series from simple to more complex. But even this order isn’t fully organized, though it might seem somewhat planned.

Transcendental philosophy has a big advantage but also a responsibility to find its ideas based on a principle. These ideas come pure and simple from the mind, as one whole, so they must be connected by a clear idea. This connection gives us a rule to figure out where each pure idea belongs and how all of them fit together before we even start, instead of leaving it to chance or random choice.

Before, we only described the mind negatively, as a way to understand things that we can’t sense. Now, we can’t rely on feelings or images to understand ideas.
