Where this investigation will be completed can never be determined with certainty by means of this as it were mechanical procedure. Further, the concepts that are discovered only as the opporA67 tunity arises will not reveal any order and systematic unity, but will B 92 rather be ordered in pairs only according to similarities and placed in series only in accord with the magnitude of their content, from the sim­ ple to the more composite, which series are by no means systematic even if to some extent methodically produced.
 
 Transcendental philosophy has the advantage but also the obligation to seek its concepts in accordance with a principle,a since they spring pure and unmixed from the understanding, as absolute unity, and must therefore be connected among themselves in accordance with a concept or idea. Such a connection, however, provides a rule by means of which the place of each pure concept of the understanding and the complete­ ness of all of them together can be determined a priori, which would otherwise depend upon whim or chance.

 The understanding has been explained above only negatively, as a non­ A68 sensible faculty of cognition. Now we cannot partake of intuition indea Princip 204 Section 1.
