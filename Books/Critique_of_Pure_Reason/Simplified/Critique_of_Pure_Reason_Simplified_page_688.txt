Since these ideas are about how we should act toward the most important goal in life—the ultimate purpose that reason helps us understand—they should focus only on what is moral.

But because we're now looking at something outside of deep philosophical ideas, we need to be careful. We don’t want to go off-topic and mess up the main idea, but we also don’t want to say too little and make things confusing. I hope to do this by staying close to the main philosophical ideas and avoiding anything about feelings or experiences.

First, I will talk about freedom in a practical way. I won’t talk about the deep philosophical meaning of freedom, which we already covered. That kind of freedom can’t be explained by experience and is a big question for reason itself. 

A choice that is just based on feelings and senses is like an animal’s choice and is only controlled by those feelings. But a choice that isn’t controlled by senses, and is based on reasons we can think about, is called free choice. Everything about this kind of choice is called practical.

We can prove practical freedom by experience. Human choices aren’t only controlled by what we feel right now. We can think about what is good or bad for us, even if it doesn’t affect us immediately. These thoughts depend on reason. Because of this, we have rules about what we should do, even if we don’t always follow them.

All practical ideas relate to things that make us feel good or bad. But since feelings aren’t about understanding things, they don’t belong to deep philosophy, which is only about pure knowledge we can have without experience.
