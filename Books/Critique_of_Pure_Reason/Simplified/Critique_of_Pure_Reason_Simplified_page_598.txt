Criticism of all ideas about God that are based only on thinking is kinder and more fair when we say that a deist believes in a God, but a theist believes in a living God (the greatest intelligence). Now, we want to find where all these ideas from reason come from.

Here, I explain that theoretical knowledge is how I understand what exists, and practical knowledge is how I think about what should exist. Theoretical reason helps me know for sure that something is true before I experience it, but practical reason helps me know what should happen before I experience it.

If it is definitely true, but only under certain conditions, that something either exists or should happen, then either a specific condition must be absolutely necessary, or it might be optional and could change. In the first case, the condition is assumed as a fact, and in the second, it is assumed as a possibility.

Because moral laws are absolutely necessary, if they need something to exist to be true, this existence must be assumed as a fact. We will later show that moral laws not only assume the existence of the highest being but also rightly assume it practically. For now, we will not focus on this argument.

If we only think about what exists (not what should be), the things we experience are always seen as uncertain or changeable. So, the condition connected to them cannot be known as absolutely necessary but only as somewhat necessary â€“ required but still optional before experience.

Therefore, if we want to know that something is absolutely necessary in theoretical knowledge, it can only come from ideas before experience, never as a cause related to something we experience.

Theoretical knowledge is called speculative if it deals with things or ideas about things that we cannot ever experience. This is different from our knowledge of nature, which only deals with things we can experience or their qualities.

The rule that we can guess a cause from an effect we see happening is a rule for understanding nature.
