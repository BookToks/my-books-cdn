In math, there are formulas that show two relationships between sizes are the same. If you know two parts of a proportion, you can figure out the third part exactly. These are always clear and definite.

In philosophy, analogy works differently. It doesn’t compare exact amounts but compares qualities or types of relationships. If you know three parts, you can understand the connection to a fourth part before you actually see it. But you can’t know that fourth part itself without experience. You have a rule to look for it and a way to recognize it when you find it.

An analogy based on experience is like a rule that helps connect what you perceive into one whole experience. It’s not a direct impression but a guideline. This rule doesn’t apply to things themselves in a fixed way, but only helps us organize what we experience.

The same idea applies to all rules about thinking based on experience. These rules help us combine what we see and feel into full experiences. They aren’t like math rules that are exact and clear on their own. Both kinds of rules are certain ahead of time, but math rules are easier to understand because we can picture them directly.

What’s important to remember is that these analogy rules only work when we use our understanding based on experience. They can’t be proven when thinking about things as they are in themselves, only when thinking about how we experience things. So, we don’t apply these rules directly to things themselves, but to how our mind organizes what we perceive.

If these rules were about things as they really are, we couldn’t know anything for sure before experience. But since they are about appearances—what we can actually experience—they aim to explain how our experiences stay connected and make sense. These ideas are based on how our mind organizes experiences, not on the things themselves.

So, these rules let us put together our experiences by comparing them to how we logically connect ideas. When we use these rules, we use a kind of mental blueprint (a schema) to guide us. This blueprint helps us apply the general rules to real experiences, acting like a key to use the rules properly.
