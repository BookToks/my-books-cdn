When people try to explain things about God or the universe just by guessing, they often expect a clear purpose or plan behind everything. But sometimes, what we find is just simple cause and effect, like a machine working. If that happens, we don’t lose all logical sense, we just miss one way of understanding how things connect.

Even if scientists make a mistake by thinking an animal’s body part has a certain purpose when it doesn’t, it’s still impossible to prove that any natural thing has no purpose at all. So, doctors and scientists guess that every part of an animal’s body has a useful job. This guess goes beyond what we can actually see, but it helps us understand things better. It’s like a helpful idea that keeps us looking for a smart reason behind everything in the world, as if some highest intelligence designed it.

But if we stop thinking of this idea as just a helpful guide and start treating it as a fact, we can get confused. We might ignore what we actually experience and try to understand things beyond what we can know, which can make our minds feel overwhelmed and lost.

The first mistake is when people get lazy with their thinking. They assume they’ve figured everything out about nature and don’t need to keep searching for answers. This is called “lazy reason.” It’s like when someone thinks their investigation is done, so they stop trying. This kind of thinking can also happen when people wrongly use ideas about the mind or soul as if they explain everything perfectly, which isn’t true.
