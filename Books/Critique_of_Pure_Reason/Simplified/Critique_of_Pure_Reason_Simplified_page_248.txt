Experience is only possible because our mind connects everything we see into one clear idea of ourselves. This happens through special rules that help us put ideas together in a certain way, using concepts. For example, the idea of a cause is just our mind linking one event to the next in time, following these rules. Without this kind of connection, which our mind controls from the start, we wouldn't have a clear, unified experience. Instead, we would just have random thoughts with no real meaning, like a confusing dream.

Trying to get these basic ideas, like the idea of cause and effect, just from experience doesn’t work. For example, experience shows us that one thing usually happens after another, but it doesn’t prove that it must happen that way every time. We can’t know for sure that one event causes another in all cases just by watching what happens. So, the rules that say every effect must have a cause can’t come only from experience. If you ask what these rules are based on, it’s not easy to explain. The reason events are connected like this is called the “affinity” of things happening together.

So, how do we understand this strong connection between events that follow rules? 

According to my ideas, it’s simple. All things we can see or experience are part of one whole self-awareness inside us. This self-awareness is always the same and is the foundation for understanding anything. Because this constant self-awareness is always there, it forces the way we put together what we experience to follow certain rules. When we think about a rule that explains how different things can be combined, and that rule must always be true, we call it a law. So, all experiences follow these laws because they come from how our mind connects everything into one clear picture.
