Part II, Division I, Book II original. Because I’m focusing on the real basics of how we understand things, I’ll call this the study of the power of judgment, which explains the idea more clearly.

Introduction: About the general power of judgment.

If we think of understanding as the ability to follow rules, then the power of judgment is the skill to decide if something fits a certain rule or not.

General logic doesn’t give any instructions for this skill, and it can’t, because it ignores what we actually know and only looks at how we think. It breaks thinking down into concepts, judgments, and conclusions, and creates rules for using understanding in a formal way.

If it tried to explain how to decide if something fits a rule, it would need another rule for that. But since that new rule would also need a way to decide if it fits, it would go on forever.

So, while understanding can be taught through rules, the power of judgment is a special skill you can only get by practicing.

This is what people call “common sense” or “natural talent.” You can’t learn it in school. A school can give you lots of rules from other people’s ideas, but knowing how to use them right has to come from you.

Without this natural gift, no rule you learn will help you use it correctly.

For example, doctors, judges, or politicians can know many important rules and even teach them, but they can still mess up when using them if they don’t have good natural judgment.

Sometimes, they understand the big ideas clearly but can’t tell if a specific situation fits those ideas.

Or they might not have had enough real practice and examples to get good at this skill.

The lack of judgment is what people usually call stupidity, and it can’t be fixed.

A person with a slow or limited mind can learn lots of facts and ideas, but often still won’t develop good judgment.

So, it’s common to find very smart people who know many rules but make mistakes when trying to apply them.
