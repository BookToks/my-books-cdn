A concept by itself doesn’t have any real meaning unless it connects to something we can sense or experience. Even if we can imagine or think about something before actually seeing it, the idea only becomes meaningful when we relate it to real experiences.

For example, in math, we learn things like space having three dimensions or that there’s only one straight line between two points. These ideas come from our minds without needing to see them first, but they only make sense because we can show them through things we can actually see or feel.

To understand an abstract idea, we need to link it to something we can picture or touch. Math does this by drawing shapes or using numbers we can count on fingers or objects like beads. We come up with the ideas first, but to use them properly, we have to connect them to the real world we experience.

This is true for all categories or principles we use to understand things. We can’t explain them without talking about how we sense things or see appearances. If we take away the connection to what we can experience, the ideas lose their meaning, and we can’t really understand what they’re about.
