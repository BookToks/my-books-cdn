Part II, Division I, Book II, Chapter III

Some people try to twist the meaning of words to avoid tough questions by making them seem obvious. When it comes to things we see or experience, we can use both understanding and reason. But we have to ask if these still work when we talk about things that are not just appearances, but things we can only understand with our mind, not with our senses.

The question is: Can we use our understanding in a special way to know things beyond what we experience? The answer we gave is no.

If we say our senses show us how things appear, but our understanding shows us how things really are, then we have to realize that this understanding is only about how things appear to us in experience, not about how they might be outside of all experience. Things as they are beyond our senses will always be unknown to us.

Understanding and our senses work together to help us know objects. If we try to use one without the other, we end up with ideas or feelings that don’t connect to any real thing we can identify.

If someone still doubts that we can’t use our understanding beyond experience, they should test it with examples. For simple ideas, understanding doesn’t add anything new because it only works with what’s already in the concept. But for bigger claims, like “everything exists as a substance” or “everything has a cause,” where do these ideas come from if they aren’t based on experience?

There must be some way to connect ideas that don’t naturally fit together to make these claims. Without using experience, no one can prove these big ideas or even show they make sense. So, we can’t rely on understanding alone without our senses to judge these things.
