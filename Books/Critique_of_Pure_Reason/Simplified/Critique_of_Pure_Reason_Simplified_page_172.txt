Space is basically about limits.

Because of this, all ideas about space come from something we understand before any experience, not from seeing or touching things. For example, the rule that in a triangle, the two sides added together are always longer than the third side, isn’t learned just by thinking about lines or triangles, but from a kind of understanding we have before seeing it, and we know this for sure.

Space is thought of as something endless. Just having a general idea of space, like knowing how big a foot or a yard is, doesn’t tell us how big space really is. If space wasn’t endless, no idea about how things relate to each other would show that space goes on forever.

From this, we can say a few things:

Space isn’t a real thing that objects have by themselves, and it doesn’t show how objects relate to each other by themselves. We can’t understand space by just thinking about objects, because space depends on how we see and feel things.

Space is just how our minds arrange everything we see outside of us. It’s like a filter that makes it possible for us to understand the world around us. Since our mind is ready to receive information before we actually see or feel things, we can understand space before any experience. That’s why we can have rules about space without needing to see everything first.

So, when we talk about space and things taking up space, we are only talking about it from a human point of view. If we stop thinking about how our mind works, the idea of space doesn’t really make sense on its own.
