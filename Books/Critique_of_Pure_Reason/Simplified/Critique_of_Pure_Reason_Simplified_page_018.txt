Kant divides the "Transcendental Analytic" into two parts: the "Analytic of Concepts" and the "Analytic of Principles." Together with the main part of the Dialectic, called the "Dialectical Inferences of Pure Reason," this repeats the old way logic books were split into three parts: concepts, judgments, and inferences. Kant uses this setup to show that when pure understanding is applied to how we sense things, it leads to good principles for making judgments. These ideas are key to his critical metaphysics. But if you try to use pure reason without considering the limits of what we can sense, it only leads to confusing and wrong ideas. The part about inferences is split into three sections: "The Paralogisms of Pure Reason," "The Antinomy of Pure Reason," and "The Ideal of Pure Reason." These sections reveal mistaken arguments about the soul, the size and origin of the world, and the existence of God.

These divisions come from earlier thinkers like Wolff and Baumgarten. They split metaphysics into "general metaphysics," also called "ontology," and "special metaphysics," which includes "rational psychology," "rational cosmology," and "rational theology." Kant replaces their "ontology" with his own "Transcendental Analytic," and then criticizes traditional metaphysics by showing the problems in the special metaphysics of psychology, cosmology, and theology.

Finally, Kant breaks down the "Doctrine of Method," where he thinks about the effects of breaking down old metaphysics and rebuilding some parts. This is divided into four chapters: the "Discipline," the "Canon," the "Architectonic," and the "History of Pure Reason." The first two are more detailed than the last two. In the "Discipline of Pure Reason," Kant compares how math proofs work versus philosophical arguments and explains his new critical or "transcendental" method. In the "Canon of Pure Reason," he prepares for his later moral philosophy by comparing theoretical philosophy to practical philosophy. He also introduces the idea that practical reason can support beliefs about God, freedom, and the soul’s immortality, even though theoretical reason can’t prove these things. The last two parts, the "Architectonic of Pure Reason" and the "History of Pure Reason," sum up how Kant’s method is different from the old ways used by dogmatists, empiricists, and skeptics, looking at these differences both in a clear system and through history.
