But it should be noted that the combination of the twofold division of the "Transcendental Analytic" into the "Analytic of Concepts" and "Analytic of Principles" with the main part of the Dialectic, the "Dialectical Inferences of Pure Reason," replicates the traditional division of logic textbooks into three sections on concepts, judgments, and inferences:IO Kant uses this structure to argue that the con­ cepts of pure understanding, when applied to the forms of sensibility, give rise to sound principles of judgment, which constitute the heart of his critical metaphysics, but that inferences of pure reason performed with­ out respect to the limits of sensibility give rise only to metaphysical il­ lusion. The treatment of inferences is in turn divided into three sections, "The Paralogisms of Pure Reason," "The Antinomy of Pure Reason," and "The Ideal of Pure Reason," which expose metaphysically fallacious arguments about the nature of the soul, about the size and ori­ gin of the world as a whole, and about the existence of God, respectively.
 
 These divisions are also derived from Kant's predecessors: Wolff and Baumgarten divided metaphysics into "general metaphysics," or "ontol­ ogy," and "special metaphysics," in turn divided into "rational psychol­ ogy," "rational cosmology," and "rational theology." Kant replaces their "ontology" with the constructive doctrine of his own "Transcendental Analytic" (see A 247 /B 303), and then presents his criticism of dogmatic metaphysics based on pure reason alone by demolishing the special metaphysics of rational psychology, cosmology, and theology.
 
 Finally, Kant divides the "Doctrine of Method," in which he reflects on the consequences of his demolition of traditional metaphysics and reconstruction of some parts of it, into four chapters, the "Discipline," the "Canon," the "Architectonic," and the "History of Pure Reason."" The first two of these sections are much more detailed than the last two. In the "Discipline of Pure Reason," Kant provides an extended contrast between the nature of mathematical proof and philosophical argument, and offers important commentary on his own new critical or "transcendental" method. In the "Canon of Pure Reason," he prepares the way for his subsequent moral philosophy by contrasting the method of theoretical philosophy to that of practical philosophy, and giving the first outline of the argument that runs through all three critiques, namely that practical reason can justify metaphysical beliefs about Gqd and the freedom and immortality of the human soul although theoreti­ cal reason can never yield knowledge of such things. The last two parts of the "Doctrine of Method," the "Architectonic of Pure Reason" and the 5 Introduction "History of Pure Reason," recapitulate the contrasts between Kant's own critical philosophical method and those of the dogmatists, empiri­ cists, and skeptics with which he began, treating these contrasts in both systematic and historical terms.
