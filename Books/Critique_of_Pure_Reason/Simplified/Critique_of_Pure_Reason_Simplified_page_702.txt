The end goal is definitely set, and from what I understand, there’s only one way this goal can fit with all other goals and actually make sense in real life. That is if there is a God and an afterlife. I’m also sure that no one else knows any other way to make all these goals work together under moral law.

Since this moral rule is also my personal rule (because reason says it should be), I will strongly believe in God and a future life. I’m sure nothing can make me stop believing this because my moral values, which I can’t give up without feeling bad about myself, would be destroyed if I did. 

Even when all the big ideas of reason go beyond what we can experience, we still have enough to feel okay about things from a practical view. Of course, no one can claim they truly know God and the afterlife exist; if someone did, that person would be exactly who I’ve been looking for. Knowing something for sure can be shared, so I could hope to learn from that person. 

But my belief isn’t logical proof; it’s a moral kind of surety. Since it depends on my personal moral feelings, I have to say, “I am morally sure,” not “It is morally sure.” Believing in God and another world is so connected to my moral nature that I’m just as unlikely to stop believing in God as I am to lose my moral feelings.

The only catch is that this belief depends on having moral feelings. If someone didn’t care about right and wrong at all, then the question about God becomes just a guessing game. In that case, reason can only support the idea of God with strong examples, but not with proof that even the biggest skeptics would accept.

People naturally care about morality, even if not completely or all the time. If you make this interest stronger, reason becomes helpful and clear in combining what we think and what we do. But if you don’t help people become at least somewhat good, you won’t make true believers out of them!
