The schemata are basically rules that connect our perceptions to time. They show how we relate what we sense to time, like how things happen in order or how long they last. These rules help us understand time in different ways, such as the sequence of events, the amount of time, and how everything fits together in time for all possible things.

This means that schematism, which comes from how our imagination works with understanding, is really about making all our inner feelings and senses come together as one. This unity helps us make sense of things inside our minds. So, the schemata are the real reasons why our pure ideas can connect to things outside us and have meaning. The categories—big ideas that organize our thoughts—only work when we use them with actual experiences. They help us follow general rules so everything we perceive fits together in one clear experience.

All our knowledge comes from possible experiences, and true knowledge that goes beyond just what we see depends on how everything relates to these experiences.

But even though the schemata help us understand categories, they also limit them because they depend on our senses. So, a schema is really just the way we experience an object, matching the category but still tied to how it appears to us. For example, number shows how much of something we see, sensation shows how real it feels, and things like permanence and necessity are also tied to how things appear to us. 

If we ignore the limits from our senses, it might seem like the categories apply to things as they are on their own, not just how they appear to us. That would mean categories have meaning beyond just the way we experience things.
