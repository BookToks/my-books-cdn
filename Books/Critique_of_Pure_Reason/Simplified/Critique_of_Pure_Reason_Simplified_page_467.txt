Sometimes, people try to understand things that go beyond what we can actually experience. But when philosophers look closely, they find out that we can’t be sure about these things just by thinking hard. This means we can’t say for sure what happens beyond what we can see or experience.

Even so, this doesn’t mean we lose hope. It actually helps us avoid believing things without real proof. If we can’t prove something for sure, then no one else can either. So, everyone has to accept that some things are just unknown.

This doesn’t take away the idea that there might be a life after this one. In fact, thinking about a future life is important when we decide how to act and live. Trying to prove a future life just by thinking doesn’t really work, and most people don’t accept those proofs anyway.

But there are good reasons to believe in a future life based on how we live and what we value. Our reason helps us understand the world and our purpose in it. It also helps us think about things beyond what we can experience, like what happens after life.

Looking at how living things are made, it makes sense that everything has a purpose. Nothing is useless or extra. Since people have talents, feelings, and a sense of right and wrong that go way beyond what helps us live now, it suggests we are meant for something more.

Because of this, people feel inside that they should live morally, even if it doesn’t bring them any reward in this life. They feel called to prepare themselves for a better life, an idea of a better world that motivates them to be good and make sacrifices now.
