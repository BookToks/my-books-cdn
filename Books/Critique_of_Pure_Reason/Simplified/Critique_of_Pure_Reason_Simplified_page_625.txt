Reason starts with the idea that all our thoughts are connected. It then imagines this connection as one simple, unchanging thing—a kind of basic substance or intelligence that exists by itself and is linked to other real things. This is how reason creates the idea of a simple, independent mind.

But reason only uses this idea to explain how our soul seems to work. It thinks of all the different parts of the soul as belonging to one subject, with all powers coming from one main power. It also sees all changes as happening in the same being and separates what happens in space from what happens when we think.

This idea of a simple substance should just be a kind of guide or model, not something we assume is really true about the soul. The soul’s real qualities might be based on things we don’t know at all. Even if we accept this idea completely, it’s just a concept that we can’t picture clearly in real life. But having this idea can help us if we remember it’s only a tool to help us understand how our soul seems to work.

If we use this idea carefully, we won’t mix up the rules about the body with what happens inside our mind. We won’t believe in strange theories about souls being created or destroyed. Instead, we’ll look at the soul carefully as its own thing and try to explain it based on one main idea. This works best if we treat this idea as if it were a real being—even though it’s just a model.

This idea about the soul is only a way to organize our thinking. Asking if the soul is truly spiritual doesn’t really make sense because it would mean taking away all physical nature and even all nature at all, which is impossible to define clearly.
