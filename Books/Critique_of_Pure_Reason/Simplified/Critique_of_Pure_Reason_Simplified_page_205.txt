Part 1. The Transcendental Aesthetic

Intuition here doesn’t mean thinking or understanding with your mind. It’s about how we first experience things, not how we think about them. This kind of intuition belongs only to the original source of being, not to something that depends on other things for its existence or understanding.

This idea is just an example to explain our theory about how we experience things, not the main proof for it.

B73 Conclusion of the Transcendental Aesthetic

Now, we have an important part to help solve a big question in philosophy: How can we know things in a way that is both new and certain, without just relying on experience?

The answer involves pure ideas of space and time, which we understand before experiencing anything. When we want to make a judgment that goes beyond just the idea itself, we find that this judgment comes from how we experience things, not just from the ideas.

But keep in mind, this kind of judgment only works for things we can actually experience with our senses.
