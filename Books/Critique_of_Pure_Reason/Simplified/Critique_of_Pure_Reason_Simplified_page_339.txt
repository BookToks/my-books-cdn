Part II, Division I, Book II, Chapter II ter talks about how things like iron filings being attracted can show us that something invisible is acting on them, even though our senses can't directly notice it. If our senses were sharper, we might directly experience this invisible thing. Wherever our senses can reach, so can our knowledge of things around us. If we don’t start from what we experience or follow the rules of how things appear to us, then trying to prove that anything exists is just showing off and not real research.

Now, about Idealism. Idealism, especially material idealism, is the idea that things outside of us in space might not really exist, or at least we can't prove they exist. There are two types: Problematic Idealism, from Descartes, says the only thing we can be sure about is that we exist. Dogmatic Idealism, from Berkeley, says space and everything in it is impossible and only exists in our imagination.

Dogmatic idealism happens if you think space is a real property that things must have by themselves. Then space and everything depending on it wouldn’t really exist. But this idea has been challenged by what we learned in the Transcendental Aesthetic.

Problematic idealism doesn’t claim anything for sure. It just says we can’t prove things outside us directly through experience, which is a careful and reasonable way to think. To prove that outer things really exist and are not just our imagination, we’d have to show that even our inner experiences depend on outer experiences, something Descartes didn’t doubt but didn’t prove either.
