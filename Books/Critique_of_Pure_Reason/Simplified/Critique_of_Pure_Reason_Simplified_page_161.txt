The goal is to decide either about the things reason asks questions about or about the ability and inability of reason to judge those things. This way, we can either trust reason more or clearly set limits for it. The main question here is: How can metaphysics be a real science?

Criticizing reason leads us to science. Using reason without this kind of criticism causes baseless claims that can be challenged by other claims, which leads to doubt and confusion.

This kind of science can't be very big because it doesn’t study many outside things, which are endless. Instead, it studies reason itself and the problems that come from reason alone. Once reason fully understands its own abilities about the things we experience, it becomes easier to clearly know where reason can and cannot go beyond experience.

So, all past efforts to create a dogmatic metaphysics are unfinished. Just analyzing the ideas we have in reason is not the final goal, but only a step toward a true metaphysics. True metaphysics means expanding what we know before experience in a meaningful way. The old way doesn’t work because it only shows what’s in our ideas, not how we get those ideas or how to use them correctly for all knowledge.

It’s not hard to give up old claims because the contradictions in reason, which can’t be ignored, have already destroyed the trust in past metaphysics. It will take courage to use a totally new method, different from the old one, to help metaphysics grow in a useful way. This new approach is necessary for human reason and can finally stop problems that have kept coming back without being solved.
