If someone thinks about an idea for a long time, they won’t come up with anything new. For example, they can explain what a straight line, an angle, or the number three means, but they won’t discover any new facts about them that aren’t already part of those ideas.

Now, imagine a math expert, called a geometer, who starts working on this problem. He begins by drawing a triangle. He knows that two right angles together are equal to all the angles you can make next to a straight line. So, he extends one side of the triangle and gets two angles next to each other that add up to two right angles.

Then, he draws a line outside the triangle that is parallel to the opposite side. This creates an outside angle that is equal to an inside angle. By following these steps, using intuition to guide him, he finds a clear and general answer to the question.

Math doesn’t just deal with shapes like in geometry; it also works with quantities in a more abstract way, like in algebra. Algebra uses symbols to represent numbers and shows how to add, subtract, and find roots. It uses these symbols to follow rules and solve problems, just like geometry uses drawings. This symbolic way of working helps find answers that just thinking about ideas alone can’t give.

Why do these two people have such different ways of solving problems? One uses just ideas, the other uses intuition to understand concepts first. The reason is clear. Some math truths come just from analyzing ideas, but others, called synthetic truths, need intuition and can be known without experience. For example, when thinking about a triangle, I don’t just think about its definition, but I also discover new properties that aren’t obvious at first but still belong to it.
