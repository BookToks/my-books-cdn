When we try to understand how things are connected, we realize that things happen at the same time, and our minds can notice one thing after another. When we imagine or think about these things, we only see each one separately—like one is happening when the other isn’t—but we don’t see that they are actually happening at the same time.

To understand that things really exist together at the same time, we need an idea that explains how these things outside of us are connected. This connection is called "interaction," where one thing affects the other, and they influence each other back and forth. Because of this, we can only really know that things exist together in space if we assume they are interacting. This interaction is what makes it possible for us to experience these things at all.

Things are simultaneous if they happen at the same time. But how do we know they happen at the same time? If the order we notice them doesn’t matter—like we can see A, then B, C, D, and E, or start from E and go back to A—then they must be happening together. If they happened one after the other in time, we couldn’t start noticing them from E and move backward to A, because A would be in the past and we couldn’t see it anymore.

So, when we see different things appearing to happen together, it means they must be connected somehow, influencing each other. This connection is what lets us say they really exist at the same time and helps us understand the world around us.
