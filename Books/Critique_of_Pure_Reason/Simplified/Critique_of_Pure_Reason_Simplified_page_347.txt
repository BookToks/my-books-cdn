It's really interesting that we can't understand if something is possible just by using categories (basic ideas) alone. We always need some kind of "intuition" or direct experience to show that these ideas actually relate to real things.

For example, think about categories related to relationships. How can we understand that something can exist on its own, not just as a part of something else (like a substance)? Or how one thing can cause another? Or how if several things exist, knowing about one can tell us something about the others? We can't figure these out just by thinking about the ideas themselves.

The same goes for other categories, like how a thing can be one among many, like a size or amount. Without intuition, we don't really know if we're thinking about a real object using these categories, or if such an object could even exist. This shows that categories by themselves are not actual knowledge; they're just ways to organize what we learn from experience.

Because of this, we can't make new true statements (called synthetic propositions) just from categories alone. For example, we can't prove "Everything that exists has a substance" or "Everything has a size" without using experience. No one has been able to prove something like "Every thing that exists by chance has a cause" just by thinking about categories.

The best we can do is show that without thinking about causes, we couldn't understand how things exist at all. But that doesn't mean causes are what make things exist. If you look back at how we proved the principle of causality, you'll see we only proved it applies to things we can experience: "Everything that happens has a cause." And we proved this as a rule for how experience works, not necessarily for things beyond experience.
