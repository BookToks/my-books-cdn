Chapter II, Section II talks about practical laws, which are different from the laws of nature. Laws of nature only explain what actually happens, while practical laws tell us how we should act.

There’s a question about whether our reason is influenced by other things when it tells us what to do. Also, what we call freedom in response to feelings might actually be controlled by nature in some way. But this doesn’t matter for practical purposes because when we use reason, we just want rules for how to behave. This is more about thinking than acting, so we can ignore it when we focus on what to do.

We understand practical freedom from experience—it’s when our reason causes us to make choices. Transcendental freedom is a bigger idea; it means reason is free from all causes in the natural world. This idea goes against natural laws and can’t be proven through experience, so it stays a mystery. But this mystery doesn’t affect how we use reason in practice. When we think about pure reason in practical terms, we only need to ask two questions: Is there a God? Is there life after death? The question about transcendental freedom is just for thinking, and we can ignore it when we focus on practical matters. It has already been discussed enough elsewhere.

In the next section, about the Canon of Pure Reason, we look at the idea of the highest good, which guides the ultimate goal of pure reason.

When we use reason to think about the world, it leads us through experiences but never fully satisfies us. It pushes us to big ideas, but these ideas eventually bring us back to experience. This process helps us understand things better but doesn’t exactly meet what we hoped for. Now, there is one more test: can pure reason in practical use lead us to ideas that help us reach the highest goals? In other words, can reason guide our actions toward what is truly good, even if it can’t guarantee answers in theory?
