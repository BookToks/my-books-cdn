When we think about things changing, it helps to focus on what stays the same in a substance, even when some parts of it can change. This way of thinking is important because it lets us separate what can change from what really lasts.

Because something stays the same, we can better understand what it means for something to change. When something appears or disappears, that isn’t the same as changing. Changing means the same thing stays around but in a different state. So, only things that last can actually change, while the parts that can start or stop are just changing, not really altering.

We can only see change in things that last over time. If something just suddenly began to exist, we would need a moment before that when it didn’t exist, but that moment wouldn’t mean anything by itself. So, new things actually come from things that already exist and keep going. This is the same with things disappearing—it means there’s a time when we no longer see them.

Things that last (we call these substances) are the base for how we understand time. If some things started or ended, it would mess up the idea that time is one continuous flow. Time doesn’t happen all at once in different parts; it happens one moment after another.

So, for anything to change, something has to stay the same underneath—it’s this lasting part that makes change possible.
