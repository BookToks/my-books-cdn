Part II, Division I, Book II, Chapter II talks about how we understand experiences and how we can only know objects through the way our mind puts things together.

If someone tried to make completely new ideas about stuff, forces, and how things interact without using real experience as a guide, they would just be imagining things with no real proof. These made-up ideas wouldn’t have any signs that they could be true because they don’t come from experience. Unlike basic ideas that all experiences depend on, these new ideas can only be understood after we experience things, or not at all.

For example, imagine a thing that’s always there in space but doesn’t take up any space, or a special power of our mind to see the future for real, or a mind ability to share thoughts directly with people far away. These ideas don’t have any real basis because they can’t be proven by experience or the rules we know from experience. Even if they don’t contradict anything, they don’t have a real connection to the world, so we can’t say they’re possible in real life.

When it comes to reality, we can’t understand it fully without help from experience, because reality is about what we sense and experience, not just ideas or made-up connections.

Now, I won’t talk about things that we can only know from real experience, but only about what we can know before experience, using just ideas. I say that we can’t know if things are possible just from ideas alone. They always depend on the rules that make any experience possible.

For example, it might seem like we can understand a triangle just from the idea of a triangle itself, since it doesn’t need experience. We can even imagine making one without seeing it. But since this is just the shape or form, it’s still only in our imagination. To know if it’s really possible, we need to think about the conditions that all real experiences have. For example, space is a basic condition that must be true for anything we experience.
