The idea that the soul exists outside of our senses is easy to understand. But this isn’t enough for someone who wants to prove using only ideas that the soul stays alive even after we die.

Some people think they’ve done enough by just asking others to find a contradiction in their ideas. They believe thinking can continue after death because they think it’s possible based on how we experience thinking while alive. But these people can get confused when faced with other possibilities that aren't even more extreme.

One such possibility is that a simple substance could split into several substances, or several substances could join to become one. Splitting something means it’s made of parts, but these parts don’t have to be separate substances. Instead, they could be different levels or powers of the same thing.

For example, you can imagine the soul’s powers, including consciousness, disappearing bit by bit, but the soul itself still stays the same. You could also imagine one half disappearing but actually continuing somewhere else. Since everything real has a certain amount of existence, cutting it in half would mean a new substance appears outside of the original.

The many parts that were split already existed before, but not as separate substances — just different amounts of reality inside one substance. The unity of the substance is just one way it exists, but splitting it changes it into many substances.

Also, these simple substances could come back together to form one again. Nothing would be lost except the number of substances, because the one substance would have the combined reality of all the previous ones.

Maybe a simple substance, which looks like matter (but not in a mechanical or chemical way we know), could create new souls by splitting itself. These new souls would replace what left by joining with similar new material.

I don’t believe these ideas are true, and the rules we have tell us to only use ideas based on experience, like the idea of substance.

But if a thinker wants to believe that just the ability to think is a thing that exists on its own, without needing anything else to be aware of, that’s because they don’t have a good explanation for how thinking works. Instead of admitting they don’t know, they say thinking must be a simple, indivisible thing.

If we look at all these ideas together, assuming they apply to all thinking beings, and start with the idea that all thinking beings are substances, then we end up back at the fact that thinking beings exist and are aware of themselves. They see themselves as independent from the outside world and able to control themselves. This self-control is part of what defines a substance.
