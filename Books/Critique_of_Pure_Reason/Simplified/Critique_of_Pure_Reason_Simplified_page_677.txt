Even though each person’s life seems random, it still follows a bigger rule when you look at everything together. But when you think about each person alone, it feels strange to say something small has such a big effect.

To argue against this, someone might suggest a big idea: that life isn’t really about time at all. Life didn’t start when we were born, and it won’t end when we die. Instead, what we see as life is just a kind of illusion, like a dream. The real life is spiritual, and the world we experience with our senses is just an image that appears to us. If we could see things as they really are, we’d realize we live in a spiritual world, and our connection to it doesn’t begin or end with our physical life.

Now, even though we don’t really know or seriously claim any of this, and it’s just a thought made to defend a point, we are still thinking about it logically. We want to show someone who says “if we can’t see it or prove it, it can’t be true” that they are wrong. You can’t rule out everything just because you don’t have proof from experience. Neither side can fully prove their ideas outside of what we experience.

If someone uses these big ideas just to challenge an opponent’s wrong claims, they shouldn’t be seen as truly believing them. They only use these ideas to stop the other person from being too sure of themselves. It’s okay to disagree with someone, but if you try to prove your point by saying their ideas are totally wrong, you are just as confident and stubborn as they are.

So, when we use reason to think about things, these big ideas aren’t meant to be true by themselves. They are only useful when arguing against extreme claims. Trying to apply what we know from experience to everything in the world is just as extreme as saying these big ideas are 100% real. Reason can only say something is definitely true if it can be known for sure, otherwise it’s just nothing.
