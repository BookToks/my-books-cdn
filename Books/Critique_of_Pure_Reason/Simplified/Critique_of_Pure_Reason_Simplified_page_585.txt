If the statement is true: "Every being that must exist is also the most real being" (which is the main point in the cosmological proof), then like any true statement, it should also work the other way around, at least partly. So, "Some of the most real beings must also exist."

Now, because one most real being is exactly the same as another, what is true for some must be true for all. This means I can say, "Every most real being must exist." Since this comes just from thinking about the ideas, the idea of the most real being must include that it has to exist. This is what the ontological proof says, but the cosmological proof doesn’t want to admit it, even though it secretly depends on it.

So, the second way of trying to prove the highest being exists isn’t just tricky like the first way. It also tricks us by pretending to offer a new path but then just brings us back to the old one we tried to leave.

Earlier, I said the cosmological argument hides many tricky ideas that careful thinking can find and break apart. I’ll just list a few here, and you can explore them more on your own.

First: It assumes that because something is temporary, there must be a cause, but this idea only makes sense in the physical world. Outside of that, it doesn’t really work. Second: It assumes there can’t be an infinite chain of causes, so there must be a first cause. But this idea can’t be proven by experience, especially when talking about things beyond what we can see. Third: It assumes the thing it’s trying to prove, which is not allowed.
