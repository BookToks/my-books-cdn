Saying that criticism is useless is like saying the police are useless just because their main job is to stop violence between people, so everyone can live safely and peacefully.

In the analysis part of the critique, it is shown that space and time are just ways we understand things through our senses. They are conditions for how things appear to us. Also, we don't have any ideas or understanding of things except through what we can sense. So, we can only know things as they appear to us, not as they really are on their own.

However, we still have to be able to think of things as they are in themselves, even if we can't really know them that way. Otherwise, it would be like saying there is an appearance but nothing that appears, which doesn’t make sense.

If we ignored the difference between things as we experience them and things as they are in themselves, then the idea of cause and effect would apply to everything. For example, I couldn’t say that a person’s will is free and also that it follows natural laws at the same time without contradicting myself. That’s because I would be thinking of the person’s soul the same way in both cases, without considering the critique’s point.

To truly understand an object, I need to prove that it’s possible, either by experience or reason. But I can think about anything as long as I don’t contradict myself. Still, to say that my idea really applies to something in the real world, I need more than just logical thinking. This extra proof might come from practical experience, not just theory.
