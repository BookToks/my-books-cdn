Pure ideas from understanding only work in your own mind. One person might connect a word to one thing, while someone else thinks of something different. So, the way we understand things based on experience isn’t always the same or true for everyone.

 

§ 19. The way all judgments work is by linking the ideas inside them through your awareness. I’ve never been happy with how logicians explain what a judgment is: they say it’s about relating two ideas. But this only really works for some types of judgments, not all. Some judgments connect ideas, while others connect whole judgments, and this difference causes problems. Plus, they don’t explain what this connection really means.

 

If I look closer at how thoughts relate in every judgment, and separate the understanding’s role from how imagination works (which is only personal), I see that a judgment is just a way to bring thoughts together into one clear awareness. The word “is” does this: it shows when ideas are connected in a real, objective way, not just in your own mind. It links your thoughts to a necessary unity, even if the judgment is based on experience and could change.
