This means that Herz's book did not affect how Kant developed his ideas about art and beauty between 1787 and 1790. Kant’s big book on this topic, the Critique of Judgment, came out in 1790. Herz’s updated book was also published that same year, but it was too late for Kant to use it when writing his own work.

Actually, when Kant talks about the "empirical interest in the beautiful" in one part of the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment, he might be indirectly criticizing Herz’s ideas. Kant had not forgotten Herz’s theory, even if he didn’t openly mention it.
