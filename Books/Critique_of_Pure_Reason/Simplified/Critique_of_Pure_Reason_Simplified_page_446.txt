When we study our soul, we should only focus on what we can learn from our own experiences and not go beyond what we can actually feel or observe inside ourselves.

Even though this study doesn’t really help us learn new facts, and is mostly made up of mistakes in thinking, it still has value. It helps us understand and question the mistakes we make when we use everyday common sense.

Why do we need to have a theory about the soul based only on pure reason? Mostly to protect our idea of ourselves from being reduced to just physical stuff. According to this idea, if you took away all matter, thinking and conscious beings would also disappear. But if you took away the thinking self, then the whole physical world would disappear too, because it’s just how we perceive things.

Of course, I don’t really understand the thinking self any better, its qualities, or whether it exists independently of the physical world. This is just as unknown as the self itself. But it’s still possible to hope, based on something other than pure thinking, that my mind can exist on its own and keep going no matter how my body changes. So, even if I admit I don’t know everything, I can defend my belief and show that no one can prove me wrong or right for sure.

From these tricky ideas about our mind, three big questions come up, which are the main focus of rational psychology. These questions can only be answered by careful study and are: 1) Can the soul live together with a body, like in a human? 2) When does this connection between soul and body start, like before or at birth? 3) What happens to the soul after death, meaning does it live forever or not?
