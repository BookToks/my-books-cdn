Nova dilucidatio (1755). In his first paper about metaphysics, Kant disagreed with some big ideas from Leibniz and Wolff, but he still agreed with some parts of their philosophy. Many of Kant’s main criticisms in this first work show up again later in his book, the Critique. There are four main points Kant makes in Nova dilucidatio.

First, Kant says no, there isn’t just one single, absolute rule that explains all truths. Wolff believed this more than Leibniz did. Kant explains that true statements that say something “is” rely on the idea “whatever is, is,” and true statements that say something “is not” rely on “whatever is not, is not.” He also says that assuming the opposite of a true statement is false is actually a big assumption itself, not something you can prove using logic. This isn’t yet the idea that some truths come from logic alone and others need more than logic—that comes later with Kant’s idea of analytic and synthetic judgments. But right from the start, Kant was doubtful that all philosophical truth could come from one single rule, like Leibniz thought.

Second, Kant didn’t agree with how Wolff and his student Baumgarten tried to prove the principle of sufficient reason. They said if something didn’t have a reason or cause, then its reason would be “nothing,” which would mean “nothing” is something. Kant thought this was a bad argument because it assumes what it’s trying to prove and just plays with words. Instead, Kant argued that for any true statement, the subject has to be clear about any property it has, so there must always be something that decides if a property applies or not. But this argument isn’t perfect either because it misses that just knowing an object’s properties is enough to decide which statements about it are true or false. Still, this shows how Kant liked to change big questions about what exists into questions about how we can know things.

This way of thinking—changing questions about reality into questions about knowledge—becomes very important in his later work, especially in the Critique of Pure Reason. There, Kant talks about how traditional philosophy, which tries to explain things about reality directly, needs to focus instead on how we can know things in the first place.
