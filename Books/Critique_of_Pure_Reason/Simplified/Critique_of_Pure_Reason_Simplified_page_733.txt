For earlier ideas about intuition, check R 3955, 3957, 3958, and 3961 (1769, 17=364-7).

To understand the difference between intuition and sensation, see R 4636 (1772-76, 17:619-20). More generally, to learn about Kant’s way of sorting different mental states, look at the inaugural dissertation, § 5 (2:394); R 619-20 (1769, 15:268); R 2835-6 (1773-77, 16:536-40); and the example given at A 320/B 367 below, along with more thoughts mentioned there.

Kant talks here about Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1711-1762). Baumgarten wrote textbooks on metaphysics and ethics that Kant used in his classes. He also introduced the word “aesthetics” as the study of art and beauty. Baumgarten’s important works were his dissertation Meditations philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus (1735) and the two-volume Aesthetica (1750 and 1758), which was never finished. It’s not clear if Kant read Baumgarten’s ideas directly or through the three-volume German book by Baumgarten’s student Georg Friedrich Meier, which Kant also used in his logic classes.

At first, Kant didn’t like Baumgarten’s new use of the word “aesthetics,” but by 1790, Kant accepted it. That year, he named a section in his Critique of Judgment “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment,” which is about what he called the “critique of taste.” For more about Baumgarten, see R 5081 (1776-78, 18:81-2). For more critical thoughts about aesthetics as Baumgarten and others saw it, check R 1578, 1579, 1587, 1588 (1760s, 16:16-23, 26-7), R 4276 (1770-71, 17:492), and R 5063 (1776-78, 18:76-7).

Kant gives a different reason for this in his Opus postumum. He says space is a way we understand things (a form of intuition), so space must be infinite. The idea is that no matter what we experience, we can always picture it in space because space is how we see outer objects. This idea depends on the proof that space is a form of intuition, which Kant is still working on here.
