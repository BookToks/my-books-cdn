We are talking about certain important questions here. I’m not including questions about where our ideas come from because right now, we’re only focusing on how sure we can be about judgments related to things in the world.

We can’t avoid dealing with these questions by just saying our reason is too limited. It’s not enough to just admit we don’t know if the world has always existed or if it had a beginning, if space goes on forever or has edges, if there are simple things or everything can be divided forever, if freedom causes things or if everything happens because of natural causes, or if there is something that exists on its own without depending on anything else.

Each of these questions is about something we can only think about in our minds—the idea of something totally unconditional, or complete, beyond anything else. If we can’t say for sure anything about these questions using our own ideas, we can’t blame the subject itself for hiding from us. Since we only have this idea in our minds and don’t find it anywhere outside of them, the problem actually comes from the idea itself. It’s a problem that can’t be solved, but we keep insisting there must be a real thing that matches it. If we clearly understand the tricky parts of our own ideas, we’ll be sure about what we need to decide about these questions.

If you say these problems are uncertain, I’d ask you this: Where do you get the ideas that cause you so much trouble? Is it from what you see and experience, which you’re trying to explain using these ideas? Imagine if nature was completely open to you, and you could see and understand everything perfectly. Even then, you still wouldn’t be able to fully understand the object of your ideas because besides seeing everything, you would need to put all these experiences together perfectly and be aware of the whole thing at once. But that’s impossible through experience alone. So, your question can’t really come from explaining any experience you have, and it’s not a question raised by the object itself.
