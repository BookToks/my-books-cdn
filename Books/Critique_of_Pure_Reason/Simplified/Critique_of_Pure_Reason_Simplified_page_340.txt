The simple fact that I am aware of my own existence shows that things outside of me must exist in space.

I know I exist because I experience time. To understand time, there must be something that stays the same in what I perceive. This thing that stays the same can’t be inside me because I only know I exist through this constant thing.

So, I can only notice this constant thing if it’s really outside me, not just something I imagine. That means I can only understand my own existence in time because real things outside me exist.

When I am aware of time, I also realize that time is possible because of these outside things. So, being aware that I exist also means I am aware that other things outside me exist.

Some people say we only experience our own inner thoughts directly and only guess that outside things are real. But here, it’s shown that experiencing outside things is immediate and real. Without actually sensing outside things, we couldn’t even imagine them.

To imagine something as outside, we must already have a way to sense outside things. This means we really do experience things outside ourselves, not just inside our minds.
