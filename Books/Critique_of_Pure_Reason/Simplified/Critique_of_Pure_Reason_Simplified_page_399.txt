Part II, Division II talks about something called the Transcendental Dialectic, which doesn’t have clear boundaries anywhere. Because of this, “transcendental” and “transcendent” don’t mean the same thing. The pure understanding principles we explained before should only be used for things we can experience, not for things beyond experience. But if a principle tries to go beyond those limits, it’s called transcendent. If we can prove that these transcendent principles are illusions, then the principles that only apply to experience can be called immanent principles of pure understanding.

A logical illusion happens when we make mistakes in reasoning because we’re not paying close enough attention to the rules of logic. But if we focus carefully on the problem, the logical illusion disappears.

Transcendental illusion is different. Even when we realize it’s an illusion, it doesn’t go away. For example, the idea that “the world must have a beginning in time” is a kind of illusion. This happens because our reason, as humans, has basic rules that seem like real laws about how things are. Because of this, we mistake the way our mind connects ideas for how things actually are in the world. This illusion is unavoidable, like how the sea looks higher in the middle than at the edges or how the moon looks bigger when it’s rising, even when we know it’s just an illusion.

So, the transcendental dialectic’s job is to reveal these illusions and help us not get tricked by them. But it can’t make the illusions completely go away like logical mistakes can. This is because transcendental illusions are natural and unavoidable — they come from how our minds work and pretend their own rules are real facts. Logical illusions, on the other hand, are just errors we can fix by following the rules properly.

In short, there’s a natural and unavoidable kind of confusion tied to human reason. It’s not because someone is careless or trying to trick others, but because this kind of illusion is built into how we think. Even after we’ve pointed out the illusion, it still keeps pushing us toward false hopes and temporary mistakes that we have to keep correcting.
