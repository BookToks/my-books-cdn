Maybe Kant had trouble picking between ideas and working out the details, which is why his Critique wasn’t finished before 1779. He suggests that to connect what we see in an organized way, like a single mind or self-awareness, we have to follow certain rules. This is because there’s a specific way we have to think about a unified mind—what Kant calls "apperception."

He says, "Whatever we think of as something we perceive follows a rule of self-awareness," and that there are three parts to this process. These three parts come from how we think about ourselves: 1. Our thoughts relate to a subject (like “me”), 2. Our thoughts happen one after another, and 3. Our thoughts form a whole. Because of this, we also apply these same ideas to the things we think about.

Kant then says, "I am the origin of all objects," meaning we understand objects by thinking about ourselves in a similar way. Sometimes, he also says we think about objects as having a subject, a sequence, and a whole set of properties, and then we think about ourselves in the same way we think about objects. For example, he explains that everything exists as part of a substance, events happen in a series, and things that happen at the same time belong to a whole where parts affect each other. How we understand ourselves matches these ways of understanding objects.

In some of his best ideas, Kant suggests there might be clear reasons why we have to use certain categories to understand time without needing to compare how we think about ourselves and objects. For example, he says that putting events in order in time needs basic rules using the same categories linked to the idea of a subject or object.

He explains that something must always come before an event for us to notice it.

Many things can come before an event, but there’s always one main thing that it follows.

Every real thing happens at a certain time and is connected to something else that helps us know when it happens.

Lots of things can happen at the same time, but there’s always something that’s definitely there with it.
