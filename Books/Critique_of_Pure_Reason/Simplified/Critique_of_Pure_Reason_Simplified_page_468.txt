This strong proof, which can never be proven wrong, comes with a growing understanding that everything we see has a purpose. It also comes with the feeling that the universe is huge and that our knowledge can keep growing without limits. Along with this, we have a strong desire to learn more. This feeling stays with us, even if we have to give up the idea that we can fully understand our own existence just by thinking about ourselves.

Now, about the mistake in psychological reasoning.

The confusion in rational psychology happens because people mix up the idea of pure reason (or pure intelligence) with the unclear idea of a thinking being in general. I think about myself, without relying on any real experience, and from this I conclude that I could be aware of my existence even outside any experience and without the conditions experience needs. This means I wrongly mix up the idea of being able to think without experience with the idea that my thinking self exists separately on its own. So, I believe I know the real, basic part of myself as a special, pure subject because I only think about the unity of consciousness that is the basis for all specific knowledge.

The problem of explaining how the soul and body are connected doesn’t really belong to the psychology we're talking about here. That problem tries to prove that the soul’s personality exists even after death, outside the body. This is a different kind of question because it goes beyond what can be experienced. Still, following our ideas, we can give a good answer to this problem. The difficulty comes from the supposed big difference between the soul, which we know through inner sense, and the body, which is known differently.
