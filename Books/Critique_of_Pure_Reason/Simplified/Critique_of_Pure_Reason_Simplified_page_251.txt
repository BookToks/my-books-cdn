Part II, Division 1, Book 1, Chapter 2: A synthesis a priori. The "transcendental unity of apperception" is connected to the pure synthesis of imagination, which is a necessary condition for putting together different pieces of information in our mind. But only the active creation (productive synthesis) by imagination can happen before experience; the passive recall (reproductive synthesis) depends on experience.

The rules for the necessary unity of this pure, active synthesis of imagination before apperception are the reason why all knowledge, especially experience, is possible. When we say the imagination connects different parts without focusing on their details, that’s called a transcendental synthesis. And if this connection is necessary and happens before any experience, it’s called transcendental unity. Since this unity is the base for all knowledge, the transcendental unity of imagination is the pure form of all possible knowledge, and all things we can experience must fit into it.

The unity of apperception combined with imagination is what we call understanding. This same unity, when connected to the transcendental synthesis of imagination, is called pure understanding. So, understanding has pure knowledge that comes before experience, which includes the necessary connection of imagination to all possible things we can see or sense. These pure ideas are called categories, or pure concepts of understanding. Because of this, our ability to know things always involves understanding that connects to what we sense through imagination. All the things we experience are related to this understanding.

Now, to explain how understanding connects with things we experience, let’s start with what we get from our senses. The first thing we get is an appearance, which becomes a perception when we are aware of it. Without being aware, an appearance can’t become something we know or understand.
