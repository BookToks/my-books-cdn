If this has never happened, and can’t be expected to happen because regular human understanding isn’t good enough for such deep thinking, then the belief that people have must come from something else. First, it comes from a natural part of us that never feels satisfied with just temporary things, since those don’t fit what we’re truly meant for. This makes us hope for a life after this one.

Second, it comes from clearly understanding our duties, which go against just following our feelings, helping us realize we have freedom. Third, it comes from seeing the amazing order, beauty, and care in nature, which leads us to believe in a wise and powerful creator.

Because of this, what people believe doesn’t get shaken. In fact, it becomes stronger because now schools are told not to claim they know more about big human questions than the average person. Instead, they focus on teaching proof that everyone can understand and that is enough from a moral point of view.

This change only affects the schools’ proud attitude. They used to act like the only experts who held the keys to these truths, sharing only some knowledge with others while keeping the rest secret. But now, they are more fair.

Still, the deep-thinking philosophers keep their special role. They study a difficult science called the critique of reason, which is helpful to people even if they don’t understand it. This study will never be popular, and it doesn’t need to be. People don’t want to learn complicated arguments for useful truths, and they don’t think about the tricky objections to these truths either.

Because schools and philosophers deal with both the arguments and objections, the critique of reason is important. It stops the problems that come up when metaphysicians (and even some religious leaders) argue without careful thinking and end up twisting their own ideas.

This careful study protects us from confusion and helps keep things clear and honest.
