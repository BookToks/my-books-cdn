About space, there is no other way we understand something outside of us that can be called naturally true before experience.

Because of this, the way we experience everything outside of us can’t be compared to anything else. For example, the nice taste of wine isn’t really a property of the wine itself. It depends on how our senses work when we enjoy it. Colors aren’t real qualities of objects either; they are just changes in how our eyes see light. But space is different. Space is always part of how we experience things outside ourselves.

Taste and colors are not necessary for us to sense objects. They are just extra effects because of how our bodies are made. So, they come from feeling and sensation, not from something true for everyone before experience. Nobody can know colors or tastes without experiencing them first. But space is about the pure way we see things, without any feelings or sensations mixed in. To understand shapes and how things relate to each other, we must be able to think about space before experience. Only through space can things be outside us as objects.

The point of this is to stop people from using wrong examples to explain why space is just an idea. Things like colors and tastes are not really part of objects but just changes in how we feel, and they can be different for everyone. For example, a rose is the same thing, but its color looks different to different people’s eyes. The big idea about appearances in space is a reminder that nothing we see in space is the object itself, and space is not a real thing outside of us.

One note says that pure idealism is about whether things really exist outside us. Critical idealism doesn’t decide that but says that the way we see things is only a part of how we understand them inside us. Another note adds that this kind of idealism helps us understand how we can know things before experience and how math is possible.
