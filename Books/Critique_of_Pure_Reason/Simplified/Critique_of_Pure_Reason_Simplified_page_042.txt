Kant says that concepts, which connect ideas together, only become clear through making judgments. Inferences, or conclusions, might seem like they need extra mental powers beyond judgment, but they are actually just complicated or repeated judgments. So, Kant says that understanding and reasoning—basically, the ability to think clearly and make logical arguments—are not two different skills. Both are just different ways of judging.

This idea that judgment is the basic form of all thinking is very important for Kant. It helps him figure out how philosophy is even possible. He asks how we can make judgments that go beyond just breaking down ideas but still apply to everyone and are always true. He thinks that the rules for using categories based on logical judgments with our experience of space and time are what make these special judgments possible in philosophy. Also, in his work called the "Transcendental Dialectic," Kant argues that traditional philosophy wrongly thinks human reason can directly understand things as they really are. Instead, reason just puts together simple judgments into more complex ones, which we call syllogisms or inferences. Kant’s focus on judgment as the main part of thinking is an important first step in all these ideas.

In another book called The Only Possible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God, Kant’s ideas move toward his main work from a different angle. The book has two main parts. First, as the title says, Kant talks about proofs for God’s existence. He improves his earlier criticism of the ontological argument and also criticizes two other popular arguments. One is the cosmological argument, which says that because the world exists, it must have a necessary cause. The other is the argument from design, which says that the world’s order shows it was made by an intelligent creator. Kant calls this the physico-theological argument. 

Second, Kant develops his own argument that God must exist as a necessary condition for anything else to be possible. This argument starts with the idea that it’s impossible to deny that something can be possible. From the idea of God as the necessary cause of possibility, Kant then explains traditional qualities of God like being unique, simple, unchanging, and even having a mind.
