Part II, Division II, Book II talks about ideas even when I don’t really understand them. The first type of wrong reasoning I call a "transcendental paralogism."

The second type of wrong reasoning deals with the idea of something being totally complete or unlimited. Because I always get a confusing idea about this, I end up believing the opposite idea is true, even though I don’t really understand that either. I call this problem the "antinomy of pure reason."

The third type of wrong reasoning happens when I look at all the conditions needed to think about things and guess there must be one ultimate thing that explains everything. But I don’t really know this ultimate thing at all, and I can’t even make a clear idea about it. I call this wrong reasoning the "ideal of pure reason."

A logical paralogism is when an argument is wrong because of its form, no matter what it’s about.
