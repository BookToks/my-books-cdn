When we imagine something or try to understand what we see, we use the same mental process. This process helps us create an idea of an object and also helps us understand how that object could exist in real life. 

The idea of things like size or amount isn’t clear just from thinking about them. We only understand these ideas when we relate them to real experiences. So, if we want to find things that match our ideas, we have to look at real experiences because that’s where things actually appear.

Even without having the experience first, we can still understand if something could exist by thinking about the rules that let us recognize objects in experience. This means we can know something might be possible before actually experiencing it, but only by following these rules.

To truly know that something exists, we need to perceive it or sense it in some way. This doesn’t mean we need to see the object right away, but there must be some connection to a real perception, like how things usually relate to each other in our experiences.

Just having an idea of something doesn’t tell us if it really exists. Even if our idea includes everything we can think about the thing, existence is about whether we can actually experience it. If we have the idea before the experience, that just means it’s possible. But real experience, which gives us actual information, is what shows something is real.

Sometimes, we can know that something exists before directly experiencing it by linking it to other experiences using the usual ways things connect in real life. By following these connections, we can understand that the thing exists because it fits into the chain of possible experiences we might have.

So, by using what we already sense and knowing how things relate to each other, we can figure out if something exists, even if we haven’t experienced it ourselves yet.
