We often think we understand things as they really are, but actually, we only know how they appear to us through our senses. For example, we know a rainbow is just how light looks in a sun-shower, but we call the rain itself the real thing. This is okay if we only think about rain in a physical way, as something that always looks the same no matter how we see it.

But if we ask whether the raindrops themselves exist as things on their own, without depending on how we see or sense them, then it becomes a deeper question. Not just the drops, but even their round shape and the space they fall through are just parts of how we experience them. The real thing behind all this, the “transcendental object,” is something we don’t really know.

The second important idea here is that our way of understanding space and time should not just seem possible but must be completely certain if it’s going to be a solid theory. To prove this, we’ll look at an example where it clearly works, to make what we said earlier even easier to understand.

Suppose space and time are real things on their own and the conditions that make things possible. Then, there are many absolutely true and necessary statements about them—especially about space—that we can know without experience. Since the truths of geometry are known this way, I ask: Where do these truths come from, and how do we understand them as being always true and necessary? The only way is through concepts or through direct experiences, which can be known either before or after experience.

But if these concepts come from experience, they can only give us truths based on what we’ve seen or felt, so they can’t be absolutely true or universal like geometry’s truths are. So, the only way to get these certain truths is something else, which we will explore.
