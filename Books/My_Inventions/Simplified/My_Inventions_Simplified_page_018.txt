Some things that happened in that city stayed stuck in my mind forever. By a strange coincidence, a lot of men who later became famous lived there around that time. Later on, I used to joke, "There were germs of greatness in that old town. Others caught it, but I didn’t!"  

I was very busy all the time with practical work, letters, and meetings with officials. But as soon as I could, I started building a simple motor in a mechanical shop across from the train station. I had brought some materials from Paris for this. The experiment took longer than I hoped, but by summer that year, I was finally happy to see the motor turn using alternating currents of different phases, and without sliding contacts or a commutator, just like I had planned a year before. It was an amazing feeling, but not as exciting as the very first time I discovered something new.  

One of my new friends was the former Mayor, Mr. Bauzin. I had already shown him this and other inventions, and he really wanted to help me. He told some rich people about my project, but sadly, no one was interested. He tried to help in every way he could. The first of July, 1919, reminds me of a special kind of help I got from him—not money, but something I really appreciated. In 1870, when the Germans invaded, Mr. Bauzin had buried a good supply of old wine from 1801. He thought I was the best person to enjoy that fancy wine. This was one of the unforgettable moments I mentioned.  

My friend told me to go back to Paris quickly and find support there. I wanted to, but my work and talks took a long time because of many small problems. Sometimes it felt hopeless.  

To show how careful and “efficient” the Germans were, I’ll share a funny story. A 16-candlepower lamp had to be put in a hallway. I picked the spot and told the worker to run the wires. After a while, he said we had to ask the engineer. The engineer had some objections but finally agreed to put the lamp two inches from my spot, so the work continued.  

Then the engineer got worried and said Inspector Averdeck must be told. Averdeck came, checked everything, argued, and decided the lamp should be moved back two inches—right where I first wanted it. But soon, Averdeck got nervous too and said he told Ober-Inspector Hieronimus and I should wait for his decision.  

It took several days before the Ober-Inspector could come. After two hours of talking, he said the lamp should be moved two inches farther. I hoped that was the end, but no. He came back and said, “Regierungsrath Funke is so picky that I can’t decide without his approval.” So we planned a visit from that important man.  

We cleaned and polished everything early in the morning. Everyone dressed up, I wore gloves, and when Funke arrived with his group, we gave him a fancy welcome. After two hours, he suddenly said, “I must be going,” and pointed to the spot on the ceiling where I had first chosen to put the lamp.  

This went on for days with small changes, but I was determined to win. In the end, I did. By spring 1884, all problems were solved, the plant was officially accepted, and I went back to Paris feeling hopeful.  

One of the bosses promised me a good payment if I succeeded, and that they would fairly reward the improvements I made to their machines. I hoped to get a lot of money. There were three bosses—let’s call them A, B, and C. When I talked to A, he said B was in charge. B said only C could decide. C said only A had the power.  

After many rounds of this, I realized my reward was just a “castle in Spain” — meaning I wouldn’t get anything. I also failed to get money to develop my ideas, which was another big disappointment.  

Then Mr. Batchellor asked me to go to America to redesign Edison’s machines. I decided to try my luck in the Land of Golden Promise.
