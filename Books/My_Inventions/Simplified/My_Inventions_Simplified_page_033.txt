We are like machines completely controlled by the world around us, moving like corks on water, but we think we have free will. The things we do are always meant to keep us alive. Even though our actions seem separate, they are all connected in unseen ways. When our body works perfectly, it reacts correctly to what happens around us. But if something goes wrong with a part of us, our ability to protect ourselves gets weaker.

Everyone knows that if someone becomes deaf, loses some eyesight, or hurts their limbs, it’s harder for them to survive. But this is also true, and maybe even more so, when the brain has problems. These brain issues can stop the “machine” inside us from working right and make us act in ways that can harm us. A very aware person, with their body working well, can sense danger even if it’s hard to notice.

When this person meets others whose bodies don’t work well, they can feel a kind of deep “cosmic” pain. This has been proven many times, and I’m asking other nature lovers to study this more. Together, we can learn things that will help the whole world.

I thought about making a machine to prove my ideas early on, but I didn’t start working on it until 1893, when I began studying wireless technology. Over the next few years, I built several automatic machines that could be controlled from far away, and I showed them to visitors in my lab. In 1896, I designed a complete machine that could do many things, but it wasn’t finished until late 1897. This machine was shown in an article I wrote in 1900 and caused a big stir when first seen in 1898.

In November 1898, I got a basic patent for this new technology, but only after the chief examiner came to New York to see it work, because what I claimed seemed impossible. I remember later meeting a government official who laughed when I told him what I’d done. No one thought it was possible to make such a device.

Unfortunately, in my patent, I said the machine was controlled by just one circuit and a common detector because I hadn’t yet protected my special ways of controlling it. Actually, my machines used several circuits working together, which stopped interference. I mostly used loop-shaped receivers with condensers because the air in the lab was full of electric charges from my transmitter. Even a small wire could pull electricity from the air for hours.

For example, a 12-inch bulb with just one wire could flash over a thousand times before the air’s charge was gone. The loop receiver wasn’t affected by this and is becoming popular now. Even though it gathers less energy than other types, it avoids many problems in current wireless devices.

When I showed my invention to crowds, people could ask any questions, and the machine would answer with signs. It seemed like magic back then, but it was simple—I was actually sending the answers through the device.

At the same time, I built a bigger automatic boat, shown in a photo in this issue of the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER. It was controlled by loops inside the hull, which was completely sealed and could go underwater. The equipment was like the first machine but had new features like light bulbs that showed when it was working right.
