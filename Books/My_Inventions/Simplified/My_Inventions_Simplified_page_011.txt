One cool thing I did was become the best crow catcher in the whole country. My way was really simple. I’d go into the forest, hide in the bushes, and copy the sound of a crow. Usually, some crows would answer me, and soon one would fly down close to me. Then, I’d throw a piece of cardboard to distract it, jump up, and grab the crow before it could get away. I could catch as many as I wanted this way.

But one time, something happened that made me respect the crows. I had caught two nice birds and was walking home with a friend. When we left the forest, thousands of crows showed up, making a loud noise. Soon, they started chasing us and surrounded us. The fun ended when I got hit hard on the back of my head and fell down. After that, they attacked me badly. I had to let the two birds go and was happy to join my friend who had hidden in a cave.

At school, there were some mechanical models that caught my attention and got me interested in water turbines. I built a lot of them and loved running them. My life was pretty amazing, and one story shows this well. My uncle didn’t like my hobby and scolded me more than once. I had read about Niagara Falls and imagined a big wheel powered by the water. I told my uncle I would go to America to build it. Thirty years later, I actually saw my idea being used at Niagara Falls and was amazed by how the mind works.

I made lots of other inventions, but the best were my crossbows. My arrows would disappear when shot and could go through a one-inch thick piece of pine wood from close up. Because I kept tightening the bows, my stomach skin got really tough, like a crocodile’s. I even wonder if that’s why I can still digest tough things! I also had cool tricks with a sling, and I could have done awesome shows at the Hippodrome. Now, I’ll tell you about one amazing thing I did with the sling that might be hard to believe.

One day, I was practicing with my sling while walking with my uncle by the river. The sun was setting, and trout were jumping in the air, shining against a rock. Any kid could have hit a fish then, but I wanted to do something harder. I told my uncle exactly what I would do: throw a stone to hit a fish, press it against the rock, and cut it in two. I did it! My uncle looked at me terrified and said, "Go away, Satan!" He didn’t talk to me for a few days after that. I know other stories might be bigger, but I feel proud of this one for a long, long time.
