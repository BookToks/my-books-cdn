When I was young and sick, there was one good thing about it. All the thinking I did helped me get better at noticing details. I realized something really important: images in my mind always came after I actually saw scenes, usually in strange or rare situations. I tried to find out what started these images. After some time, this became almost automatic, and I got really good at linking causes and effects. 

Then I noticed, to my surprise, that every thought I had was triggered by something I saw, heard, or felt outside. Not just thoughts, but all my actions happened because of these outside triggers. Over time, it became clear to me that I was like a robot that moves and thinks only because my senses tell me to. This idea led to something called telautomatics, which means machines that can act on their own. So far, this has only been done a little bit, but someday it will be a big deal. I’ve been working for years on making machines that can control themselves and act like they have some kind of brain. This could change many businesses and industries.

When I was about twelve, I first managed to stop an image in my mind on purpose. But I never controlled the flashes of light I talked about before. Those flashes were strange and hard to explain. They usually happened when I was in danger, upset, or really excited. Sometimes, I saw the air around me filled with flames. Instead of getting weaker, the flashes got stronger over time and were strongest when I was about twenty-five. 

One time in Paris in 1883, a famous French businessman invited me to go shooting with him, and I said yes. I had been stuck inside the factory for a long time, so the fresh air felt amazing. But when I got back that night, it felt like my brain was on fire. I saw a light like a tiny sun in my head and spent the night putting cold cloths on it. The flashes got less often and weaker, but it took over three weeks for them to stop completely.

When he invited me again, I said a clear NO!

These light flashes still happen sometimes, like when a new idea comes to me, but they aren’t as strong or exciting anymore. When I close my eyes, I always see a very dark blue background, kind of like the sky on a clear night with no stars. After a few seconds, I see lots of tiny green sparkles in layers coming toward me. Then, on the right side, a pretty pattern of two sets of straight lines crossing each other appears in many colors, mostly yellow-green and gold. The lines get brighter, and the whole thing is covered with twinkling dots of light. This picture moves slowly across my vision and disappears to the left in about ten seconds. Then I see a dull gray background that feels kind of unpleasant and lifeless, but soon it changes to a rolling sea of clouds that seem to try to make shapes. It’s strange because I can’t make a shape in the gray part until the clouds show up. Every night before I fall asleep, I see images of people or things quickly flash in front of me.

When I see these images, I know I’m about to fall asleep. If they don’t come, it means I won’t sleep that night.

Imagination played a big role in my early life, and I have another strange story to show this. Like most kids, I loved jumping and really wanted to float in the air. Sometimes, a strong wind from the mountains, full of fresh oxygen, made my body feel super light like a cork. Then I would jump and float for a long time. It felt amazing, and I was really sad when I realized it wasn’t real.

During that time, I developed many strange likes, dislikes, and habits. Some came from things I saw or felt, but others were weird and I couldn’t explain them. For example, I really hated women’s earrings, but I liked other jewelry like bracelets depending on how they looked. Seeing a pearl almost made me feel sick, but I loved the shine of crystals or things with sharp edges and flat surfaces.
