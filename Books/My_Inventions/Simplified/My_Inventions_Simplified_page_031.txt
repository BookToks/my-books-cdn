In one of the stories about my life, published in the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER, I talked about my early years and a problem I had that made me use my imagination and pay close attention to myself all the time. At first, this thinking was forced on me because of my illness and pain, but over time it became natural. It helped me realize that I was like a machine without free choice in my thoughts or actions, only reacting to things around me.

Our bodies are very complex, and the movements we make are many and complicated. The things we sense from the world are very delicate and hard to notice. Because of this, most people don’t understand that we act like machines. But for scientists who study this, the idea that life works like a machine is very clear. This idea was first suggested by Descartes about 300 years ago. Back then, many parts of our bodies and how light and the eye work were still mysteries.

Recently, science has made big progress in understanding these things, and now no one doubts this idea. Many books have been written about it. One great supporter of this idea is Felix Le Dantec, who once worked with Pasteur.

Professor Jacques Loeb did amazing experiments with how light controls simple living things. His latest book, "Forced Movements," explains this well. Scientists accept this theory like any other fact, but for me, it’s something I prove every moment with everything I do and think.

I always notice something outside myself that makes me move or think. Only rarely, when I am very focused, do I find it hard to see what started my actions.

Most people don’t notice what is happening inside or around them. Because of this, many get sick and die too soon. Everyday things seem strange and hard to explain to them. For example, someone might suddenly feel sad and try to find a reason without realizing a cloud blocked the sun. Or they might think a strange thing happened when they just recently saw a friend or a photo of them. When someone loses a button, they get upset and can’t remember where it went. Not paying attention is just a kind of ignorance and causes many wrong ideas and strange beliefs. About nine out of ten people believe in things like telepathy, spiritualism, and talking to the dead, and they listen to people who trick them.

To show how common this is, even among smart Americans, I’ll tell a funny story. Just before the war, when I showed my turbines in this city, many technical magazines talked about them. I thought many companies would want to buy my invention. I was especially waiting for a man from Detroit who is very good at making millions. I was so sure he would come that I told my secretary and helpers. One day, a group of engineers from the Ford Motor Company came to see me about a big project. I said proudly, "Didn’t I tell you?" and one helper said, "You’re amazing, Mr. Tesla; you predict everything." But when I started to explain my turbine, the leader stopped me and said, "We know about your turbine, but we are here for something else. We started a group to study psychic things and want you to join us." I think those engineers didn’t know how close they were to being kicked out of my office.
