Using this idea, I was able to create electrical pressures of 4,000,000 volts, which was about the highest I could reach in my new lab on Houston Street, because the sparks jumped across a distance of 16 feet. A photo of this transmitter appeared in the Electrical Review in November 1898.

To make more progress, I had to work outside. In spring 1899, after getting ready to build a wireless system, I went to Colorado and stayed there for over a year. While there, I made other improvements that let me create electrical currents with any amount of power I wanted. People interested can read about these experiments in my article "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy" in Century Magazine, June 1900, which I mentioned before.

The ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER asked me to explain clearly how my "Magnifying Transmitter" works so that young readers can understand it. First, it’s a special kind of transformer with parts arranged in space on smooth, curved surfaces that are far apart. This keeps the electric charge spread out evenly, so no electricity leaks even if the wires are bare. It works at many different frequencies, from very low to very high, and can produce either huge currents at moderate voltage or smaller currents at very high voltage. The highest voltage depends on the shape and size of the charged parts.

From my experience, reaching 100,000,000 volts is possible. Also, antenna currents of thousands of amperes can be made. You don’t need a huge setup for this—a terminal less than 90 feet wide can create that voltage, and an antenna 30 feet wide can handle currents of 2,000 to 4,000 amperes at normal frequencies.

In a simpler sense, this wireless transmitter hardly sends out regular Hertz waves compared to its total energy. This means it loses very little power and can store a huge electric charge high up.

This setup can be powered by any type of impulses, even slow ones, and it produces smooth, steady oscillations like those from an electric generator.

More narrowly, it is a resonant transformer designed to fit the Earth’s size and electrical nature. Because of this, it works very efficiently for sending wireless energy. The distance doesn’t weaken the signal at all—in fact, the effects can even get stronger the farther the signal travels, following a precise mathematical rule.

This invention was part of my "World-System" for wireless communication, which I started to develop commercially when I came back to New York in 1900. The main goal was clearly stated then: the "World-System" combined several original discoveries I made through long research and experiments. It allows instant and exact wireless sending of any signals, messages, or codes anywhere in the world, and it can connect existing telegraph, telephone, and other signal stations without changing their current equipment.
