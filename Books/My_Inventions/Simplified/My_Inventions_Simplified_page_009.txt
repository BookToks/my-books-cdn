One day I went alone to the river to have fun, like I usually did. But when I got close to the stone wall, I was shocked to see the water had risen and was carrying me away fast. I tried to escape, but it was too late. Luckily, I saved myself by holding onto the wall with both hands. The water pushed hard against my chest, and I barely kept my head above the water. No one was around, and my voice was lost in the loud sound of the waterfall. Slowly, I got tired and couldn’t hold on much longer. Just when I was about to let go and be smashed on the rocks below, I suddenly remembered something I had learned about how water pressure works. I turned onto my left side. Like magic, the pressure got smaller, and it became easier to fight the strong water. But I was still in danger. I knew I would be swept away eventually because no one could help me in time, even if I called for help.

Now I am good with both hands, but back then I was left-handed and my right arm was weak. So I didn’t dare turn onto my right side to rest. I had no choice but to slowly push myself along the dam. I had to get away from the mill because the water there was faster and deeper. It was a long and painful struggle. Near the end, I almost gave up because there was a dip in the stone wall. I used all my strength to get over it and then passed out when I reached the bank. Someone found me there. I had almost all the skin torn from my left side, and it took weeks for the fever to go away and for me to get better. These are just two examples, but they show that if I hadn’t had the inventor’s instinct, I wouldn’t be alive to tell this story.

People often ask me when and how I started inventing. From what I remember, my first try was pretty big because it involved making a device and a new way to do something. Someone else made the device first, but my method was new. Here’s how it happened. One of my friends got a fishing hook and tackle, which made everyone in the village excited. The next morning, everyone went out to catch frogs. I was left out because I had fought with that boy. I had never seen a real hook and thought it was something amazing with special powers, so I was sad not to join the group. But I didn’t give up. I found a piece of soft iron wire, sharpened one end by hitting it between two stones, bent it into a hook shape, and tied it to a strong string. Then I cut a stick, got some bait, and went to the brook where there were many frogs. I couldn’t catch any at first and almost gave up. Then I tried hanging the empty hook in front of a frog sitting on a stump.

At first, the frog collapsed, but then his eyes popped out and turned red, he got twice as big, and snapped hard at the hook.

I pulled him up right away. I tried this many times, and it worked every time. When my friends, who had fancy gear but no frogs, saw me, they were really jealous. I kept my secret for a long time and enjoyed being the only one who could catch frogs this way, but finally, I shared it at Christmas. After that, every boy could do it, and the next summer the frogs had a tough time.

My next invention came from a natural idea that later became important to me – using nature’s power to help people. I did this with Maybugs, or June-bugs as they’re called in America. These bugs were everywhere and sometimes broke tree branches because there were so many of them. The bushes were full of them. I tied up to four bugs to a crossbar that could spin on a thin stick. Their movement turned a big disc and made a lot of "power." These bugs were amazing because once they started moving, they didn’t stop and kept spinning for hours. The hotter it was, the harder they worked.

Everything was going well until a strange boy came to the area. He was the son of a retired Austrian Army officer. That boy ate Maybugs like they were fancy oysters and loved them!
