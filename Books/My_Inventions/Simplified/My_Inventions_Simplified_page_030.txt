All the old Hertzian devices and ways are gone now. We’ve gone in a completely different direction, and what we’ve done comes from the hard work and ideas of people in this country. The main patents have expired, so everyone can now use these ideas. The Secretary’s main point is about interference. He said, as reported in the New York Herald on July 29th, signals from a strong station can be picked up in every village around the world. Since this was proven in my 1900 experiments, putting restrictions in the United States wouldn’t help much.

To explain this, I want to share a recent story. A strange man came to me, asking for help to build world transmitters far away. He said, "We have no money, but we have loads of solid gold and will pay you well." I told him I first wanted to see what would happen with my inventions in America, and that ended our meeting. But I’m sure some secret forces are working behind the scenes, and as time goes on, keeping communication going without problems will get harder.

The only solution is a system that can’t be interrupted. It’s already been perfected and exists; all we need to do is start using it.

The terrible war is still fresh in everyone’s minds, and the Magnifying Transmitter will probably be seen as a powerful weapon for attack and defense, especially with Telautomatics. This invention came from ideas I’ve had since I was a kid and worked on all my life. When the first results came out, the Electrical Review said it would become one of the “most powerful tools for progress and civilization.” That time is coming soon. In 1898 and 1900, I offered it to the Government, and it might have been used if I had been the kind of person to beg for favors. Back then, I really thought it could end war because it was so destructive and removed personal combat. But even though I still believe in its power, my opinion has changed since then.

War can’t stop until the real reason for it is gone. The main cause is how huge the planet is. Only by completely getting rid of distance—through faster communication, travel, and energy transfer—can we create conditions that last and keep peace. What we really need is closer connections and better understanding between people and communities worldwide. We also need to get rid of extreme pride in nations that often leads to violence and chaos. No group or law will ever fully stop war. These are just ways for the strong to control the weak. I said this 14 years ago when some big governments wanted to make a kind of Holy Alliance, an idea pushed by Andrew Carnegie, who gave it lots of attention before the President did. While such an agreement might help some weaker countries, it won’t achieve true peace. Peace will come only when everyone is educated and different races come together, and we’re still far from that.

Looking at the world today after the huge struggle we’ve seen, I truly believe the United States should stick to its traditions and avoid “entangling alliances.” Because of where it is, far from most conflicts, with no desire to take land, and with endless resources and a big population that values freedom and justice, this country is in a special and lucky spot. It can use its great power and moral strength on its own, helping everyone better and smarter than by being part of a group.
