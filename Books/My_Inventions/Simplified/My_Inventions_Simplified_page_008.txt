My friends often say that my suits fit me perfectly, but they don’t know that all my clothes were made using measurements taken almost 35 years ago and never changed. During that time, my weight hasn’t changed even one pound.

I have a funny story about this. One winter evening in 1885, Mr. Edison, Edward H. Johnson (the President of the Edison Illuminating Company), Mr. Batchellor (Manager of the works), and I went into a small place across from the company’s offices. Someone suggested guessing each other’s weight, and I agreed to step on a scale. Edison felt me all over and said, “Tesla weighs 152 pounds, to an ounce,” and he guessed exactly right. I weighed 142 pounds without clothes, and that’s still my weight today. I whispered to Mr. Johnson, “How could Edison guess my weight so well?” He told me quietly, “He used to work in a Chicago slaughterhouse where he weighed thousands of hogs every day! That’s why.” My friend Chauncey M. Depew once told me about an Englishman who didn’t get one of his jokes at first but laughed a year later. I admit it took me even longer to get Johnson’s joke.

My health comes from living carefully and in a balanced way. The surprising thing is that when I was young, I got really sick three times and doctors thought I wouldn’t survive. I also got into all kinds of dangerous situations because I was careless at times, but somehow I always managed to get out of trouble like by magic. I almost drowned a dozen times, was nearly boiled alive, almost burned, trapped underground, lost, and frozen. I barely escaped attacks from wild animals like mad dogs and hogs. I went through terrible diseases and strange accidents, so it feels like a miracle that I am healthy today. But when I think back, I believe it wasn’t just luck that kept me alive.

Inventors are basically life-savers. Whether they control forces, improve tools, or create new comforts, they make life safer. They are also better at protecting themselves because they pay attention and think quickly. If I didn’t have other proof that I have these qualities, I would believe it from my own experiences. You can decide for yourself when I tell you one or two stories.

When I was about 14 years old, I wanted to scare some friends who were swimming with me. I planned to dive under a long floating bridge and sneak out on the other side. Swimming and diving came to me naturally, and I was sure I could do it. So I jumped into the water and, once out of sight, swam quickly toward the other side. Thinking I was past the bridge, I surfaced but hit a beam. I dove again and swam fast until I was running out of breath. When I surfaced a second time, I hit another beam. I was getting desperate.

I used all my strength to try a third time, but the same thing happened.

Holding my breath became unbearable, my head was spinning, and I felt myself sinking. At that hopeless moment, I had a sudden idea. I noticed a small space between the water and the boards above me. Almost unconscious, I floated up, pressed my mouth against the boards, and managed to breathe in some air, though it was mixed with water that almost choked me. I repeated this several times like in a dream until my pounding heart calmed and I felt better. After many failed dives, having lost my sense of direction, I finally got out of the trap. My friends had already given up and were trying to fish my body out.

That swimming season was ruined because I was careless, but I forgot the lesson quickly. Just two years later, I got into an even worse situation. Near the city where I was studying, there was a big flour mill with a dam across the river. Usually, the water was only two or three inches above the dam. Swimming out to it was a common, not very dangerous, game that I often played.
