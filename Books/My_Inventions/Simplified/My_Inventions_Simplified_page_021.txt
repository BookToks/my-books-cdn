V. The Magnifying Transmitter

Looking back at my life, I see how small things can change our future in big ways. When I was young, something happened that shows this. One winter day, I climbed a steep mountain with some other boys. The snow was deep, and a warm wind made it just right for us. We played by throwing balls that rolled down the hill, picking up snow as they went, trying to beat each other in this fun game. Suddenly, one ball rolled too far. It grew huge, as big as a house, and crashed into the valley below, shaking the ground. I watched, amazed, not understanding how something so small got so big. For weeks, I kept thinking about that avalanche and how tiny actions could grow so much. Since then, I became really interested in how small things can get bigger, and years later, when I studied how machines and electricity work, I was excited from the start.

Maybe if I hadn’t seen that, I wouldn’t have followed the small spark I got from my coil or created my best invention. I’m going to tell its real story here for the first time.

People often ask me which of my inventions I like best. It depends on how you look at it. Some experts, good in their fields but narrow-minded, say that except for the induction motor, I haven’t made much useful. That’s wrong. A new idea shouldn’t be judged just by what it does right away. My system for sending power using alternating current came at the right time, answering big industrial problems. Even though some people resisted at first, it didn’t take long for it to be used. Now, think about my turbine. You’d expect such a simple and smart invention to be used immediately. And it would be, if things were different. The turbine didn’t make old machines useless; it made them better. But my turbine was a big change because it meant people would have to stop using old engines that cost billions of dollars. So progress was slow because experts, influenced by organized groups, didn’t want to accept it.

Just recently, I had a frustrating talk with my friend and old assistant, Charles F. Scott, who is now a professor at Yale. We hadn’t met in a long time, so I was happy to chat at my office. We ended up talking about my turbine, and I got really excited about its future. I said, “Scott, my turbine will replace all the heat-engines in the world.” Scott thought for a while, then said, “That will make quite a pile of scrap,” and walked away without saying more.

My inventions were just steps forward in different ways. I made them because I wanted to improve what we had, not really thinking about bigger needs. The “Magnifying Transmitter” took many years to develop and was focused on solving problems much more important than just making industry better.

If I remember right, in November 1890, I did a lab experiment that was one of the most amazing and exciting ever in science. While studying high-frequency electric currents, I found I could create a strong electric field in a room that lit up special vacuum tubes without electrodes.
