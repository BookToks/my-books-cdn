II. My First Attempts at Inventing

I’ll talk a little about these unusual experiences because they might interest people who study how the mind and body work. Also, this tough time was very important for how I grew mentally and for the work I did later. But first, I need to explain what happened before these experiences and why they might have happened.

Since I was a kid, I had to focus a lot on myself. This caused me a lot of pain, but now I think it was a good thing because it taught me how important it is to really understand yourself. In today’s busy world, with so much going on and so much information coming at us all the time, life can be risky. Most people are so focused on what’s happening around them that they forget to pay attention to what’s going on inside their own minds and bodies.

Many people die early mainly because they don’t notice these inner problems. Even careful people often worry about things that aren’t real dangers and ignore the real ones. This isn’t just true for individuals but for whole groups of people too. For example, there’s a big effort to stop people from drinking alcohol in this country, but things like coffee, tea, tobacco, and chewing gum — which people use even when they’re young — actually harm the body more. When I was a student in Vienna, a city where lots of people drink coffee, I saw that heart problems caused up to 67% of deaths. The same might be true in places where people drink a lot of tea.

These tasty drinks excite the brain too much and slowly wear it out. They also mess up blood flow in the body and should be used less because their bad effects happen slowly and are hard to notice. Smoking helps people think easily and feel good but makes it harder to focus deeply, which is needed for creative and hard thinking. Chewing gum helps for a little while but soon harms the glands and causes serious damage. Alcohol in small amounts can be good for you, but too much is poisonous, no matter if it’s whiskey or made from sugar in your stomach. Still, all these things help the body get rid of weak parts, which is nature’s way of making sure the strongest survive. People who want to make strict rules should remember that humans often don’t like being controlled, so doing nothing is often better than forcing rules.

The real truth is that we need some stimulants to do our best in today’s world, but we must control ourselves and not overdo it. That’s what I have done for many years, and it’s helped me stay young in body and mind. I didn’t always like avoiding these things, but now I enjoy the good results. I want to share a couple of stories to show what I mean.

Not long ago, I was walking back to my hotel on a very cold, slippery night with no taxi around. Another man was walking behind me, also wanting to get inside quickly. Suddenly, I slipped and fell. But my brain reacted instantly, my muscles moved, and I flipped around in the air and landed on my hands. I kept walking like nothing happened. When the man caught up to me, he looked me over and asked, "How old are you?" I said, "About fifty-nine." He said, "I’ve seen a cat do that, but never a man."

About a month ago, I wanted new glasses and went to an eye doctor. He tested my eyesight, and I could read the smallest letters from far away easily. When I told him I was over sixty, he was shocked.
