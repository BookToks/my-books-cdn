After struggling for a while with a new type of technology that I wasn’t really made for, I finally got a reward. In April 1887, the Tesla Electric Company was started, giving me a lab and the tools I needed. The motors I built there looked exactly like I had imagined. I didn’t try to change the design; I just copied what I saw in my mind, and the motors worked exactly as I expected.

In early 1888, I made a deal with the Westinghouse Company to make the motors on a big scale. But there were still big challenges. My system used low frequency currents, but Westinghouse experts used 133 cycles because they thought it would help with the transformers. They didn’t want to change their usual equipment, so I had to focus on making the motor work with their setup. It was also hard to make a motor that ran well at this frequency using only two wires.

At the end of 1889, since my work in Pittsburgh wasn’t needed anymore, I went back to New York and started working again in a lab on Grand Street. I began designing machines that used high frequencies. Building these machines was new and tricky, and I had lots of problems. I didn’t use the inductor type because I was worried it wouldn’t make perfect sine waves, which were really important for resonance. This choice caused me extra work. Another problem was that the high frequency machines didn’t run at a steady speed, which made them hard to use. I had noticed during my talks that sometimes the machine lost its tune and had to be fixed. I didn’t yet realize that later I would find a way to keep the speed so steady that it hardly changed at all.

Because of these issues, I thought it would be better to invent a simpler way to create electric waves. Back in 1856, Lord Kelvin had explained how a condenser discharges, but no one had made it practical. I saw the chance and started working on induction devices using this idea. I made quick progress and by 1891, I showed a coil that made sparks five inches long.

At that lecture, I honestly told the engineers about a problem with the new method: some energy was lost in the spark gap. Later studies showed that no matter what you use — air, hydrogen, mercury vapor, oil, or even electrons — the efficiency is always the same. It’s like dropping a weight from a height: it doesn’t matter how you drop it, the energy used is the same. Luckily, this problem isn’t a big deal because by tuning the circuits right, you can get about 85% efficiency. Since I first announced this invention, it has become widely used and changed many fields. But the best is still to come. In 1900, when I made huge sparks 100 feet long and sent a current around the world, I remembered the tiny spark I first saw in my Grand Street lab and felt the same excitement I had when I discovered the rotating magnetic field.
