That nasty sight made me stop trying to work with insects, and after that, I couldn’t even touch a May-bug or any other bug.

Then, I think I started taking apart and putting back together my grandfather’s clocks. I was good at taking them apart but often messed up when trying to put them back. So, he stopped me in a not-so-kind way, and I didn’t work with clocks again for thirty years. Soon after, I made a kind of pop-gun with a hollow tube, a piston, and two plugs of hemp. To fire it, you pressed the piston against your stomach and pushed the tube back fast with both hands. The air between the plugs got squeezed and heated up, and one plug shot out with a loud bang. The trick was to find the right tube shape from hollow plant stalks.

I did well with that gun, but my fun caused trouble with the window panes in our house, and I got into big trouble. If I remember right, then I started carving swords from pieces of old furniture I could find. Back then, I loved Serbian national poetry and admired the heroes’ brave deeds. I spent hours pretending to fight and cut down my enemies, who were just corn-stalks ruining the crops. This got me several spankings from my mom. And these weren’t just pretend spankings—they were real.

I had done all this and more before I turned six and finished one year of elementary school in my village, Smiljan, where I was born. Then we moved to a small city nearby called Gospic. This move felt like a disaster to me. It almost broke my heart to leave our pigeons, chickens, sheep, and especially our huge flock of geese. Every morning, the geese flew up into the clouds and came back at sunset in perfect battle formation that would have impressed the best pilots today. In our new house, I felt like a prisoner, watching strange people through the window blinds. I was so shy that I would rather face a roaring lion than one of the city kids walking around. But the hardest part was on Sundays when I had to dress up and go to church.

At church, something terrible happened that scared me for years. It was only my second time in a church. Not long before, I had spent a night locked inside an old chapel on a mountain that people only visited once a year. That was awful, but this church thing was worse. A rich lady in town, who was nice but very showy, always came to church all dressed up with a huge dress train and helpers. One Sunday, I had just finished ringing the bell in the belfry and ran down when I accidentally stepped on her train. It ripped off with a loud tearing sound like a bunch of soldiers firing guns for the first time. My dad was furious. He gave me a light slap on the cheek—the only time he ever hit me—but I still feel it now. The shame and confusion were awful. People pretty much ignored me until something else happened that made me a hero again.

A young merchant had started a fire department. They bought a new fire engine, gave out uniforms, and trained the men for work and parades. The engine was actually a big pump worked by sixteen people and was painted red and black. One afternoon, they planned a big test by the river. The whole town came to watch. After speeches and ceremonies, they told the men to start pumping, but no water came out. Experts tried to fix it but failed. Then I showed up. I didn’t really know how it worked or much about air pressure, but I guessed to check the hose in the water. It had collapsed. I waded into the river and opened it, and water came rushing out, ruining a lot of Sunday clothes. Archimedes running naked through the streets shouting “Eureka!” didn’t make a bigger splash than I did. I was lifted on people’s shoulders and was the hero of the day.

After we moved to the city, I started a four-year course at Normal School to prepare for college or Real Gymnasium. During this time, I kept having adventures, making mistakes, and getting into trouble like usual.
