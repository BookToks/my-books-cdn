Some of the smartest and most famous scientists once told me I have a unique mind. Because of that, I focused all my thinking on solving big problems, no matter what I had to give up. For many years, I tried to understand death and looked for any kind of spiritual signs. But only once did I have an experience that felt like something supernatural. It happened when my mother died. I was very tired from pain and staying up so long, and one night I was taken to a building a couple of blocks from our house.

While I was there, I thought that if my mother died while I wasn’t by her side, she might try to send me a sign. A few months before, I had been in London with my late friend, Sir William Crookes, and we talked about spiritualism. I was very interested in those ideas then. I might not have listened to others, but I trusted him because of his important work on radiant matter, which had inspired me as a student to study electricity. I thought this was a good chance to see if there was something beyond life, especially since my mother was very smart and had strong intuition.

That whole night, I waited with all my mind, but nothing happened until early morning when I fell asleep or maybe fainted. I saw a cloud with beautiful angel-like figures, one of whom looked at me kindly and slowly changed to look like my mother. The image floated across the room and disappeared. I woke up to a sweet song sung by many voices. At that moment, I felt sure, in a way words can’t explain, that my mother had just died. And she really had.

I didn’t understand how heavy this painful knowledge was, and I wrote a letter to Sir William Crookes while still feeling these strong impressions and not in good health. When I got better, I searched for the real cause of this strange event. After many months, I found out it was something I felt relieved about. I had seen a famous artist’s painting before, showing a season as a cloud with angels floating in the air, just like in my dream, except for my mother’s face. The music I heard was from a nearby church choir during an early Easter morning mass, which explained everything in a way that made sense scientifically.

This happened a long time ago, and since then, I have never had a reason to change my thoughts about spiritual and psychic things, which have no real proof. Believing in them comes naturally as people’s minds grow. Religious rules are not accepted the same way anymore, but everyone still believes in some kind of higher power. We all need something to guide us and make us feel okay. It doesn’t matter if it’s a religion, art, science, or something else, as long as it helps us live peacefully. It’s important for everyone to share a common idea to keep peace in the world.

Even though I couldn’t find any proof for what psychologists and spiritualists say, I have learned for sure that life works like a kind of automatic system. I saw this not only by watching people’s actions but also by finding bigger patterns. This discovery is very important for society, and I want to talk about it briefly. I first noticed this amazing truth when I was young, but for a long time, I thought what I saw was just coincidence.

Here’s what I found: whenever I or someone I cared about, or something I believed in, was hurt by others in the most unfair way, I felt a strange, hard-to-explain pain that I called "cosmic." Soon after, the people who caused the pain always got into trouble. After many times like this, I told some friends, and they saw it was true. This led me to a simple idea: our bodies are built in similar ways and face the same outside influences. Because of this, we react in similar ways, and this connection is the basis for all our social rules and laws.
