Interference can’t be fixed by the methods people have suggested. Here’s the real deal: in the air, the electric charge goes up by about fifty volts for every foot you go higher. Because of this, the top and bottom of an antenna can have a difference of pressure of twenty or even forty thousand volts. The charged air is always moving and gives electricity to the antenna in bursts, not smoothly. This causes a grinding noise in sensitive receivers. The taller the antenna and the bigger the space covered by the wires, the stronger this effect is. But remember, this is just a local problem and doesn’t cause the main issues.

In 1900, while I was working on my wireless system, one setup had four antennas. These were tuned to the same frequency and connected together to make the signal stronger from any direction. When I wanted to find where the signals were coming from, I connected pairs of antennas in a special way. Sometimes the sound was loud, and sometimes it stopped because the antennas canceled each other out, just like I expected. But the static noise happened in both cases, so I had to create special ways to stop it.

By using receivers connected to two points in the ground, which I suggested long ago, the problem caused by the charged air can be stopped. This is a big issue in the big antennas built today. Also, this method cuts other types of interference by about half because of the way the circuit is set up. This was obvious to me, but surprised some people who only knew older, less effective equipment. Some thought stray signals caused the interference and that you could fix it by not using antennas at all. But actually, a wire buried in the ground, which should be safe, often picks up more unwanted signals than one standing up in the air. To be fair, some progress has been made, but not because of any special trick or device. It happened because people stopped using huge antenna structures, which are bad for receiving, and started using better receivers. Like I said before, to really fix this problem, the whole system needs a big change, and the sooner, the better.

It would be really bad if, while this technology is still new and most people, even experts, don’t understand how amazing it can be, the government decided to make it a monopoly. This was suggested recently by Secretary Daniels, who probably believes it’s a good idea. But all evidence shows that competition makes the best results happen. Wireless technology especially needs to be free to grow. First, it has the potential to improve human life more than any other invention ever. Also, it’s important to know that this whole technology was developed here in America, and it belongs to us more than even the telephone, the light bulb, or airplanes do. Some people, like press agents and stock sellers, have spread wrong info, and even good magazines like Scientific American have given credit to other countries. Sure, the Germans discovered Hertz waves, and experts from Russia, England, France, and Italy used them for signaling. But their work was just an obvious use of a new discovery and done with old, basic tools. Their signals didn’t go very far or do much, and actually, sound waves, which I suggested back in 1891, could have been better for sending messages. Plus, all these foreign efforts happened three years after the basic ideas of the wireless system we use today were already explained and developed right here in America.
