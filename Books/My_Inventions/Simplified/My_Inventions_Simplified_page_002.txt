My Early Life

People get better and better because of inventions. Inventions come from creative thinking. The goal is to control nature and use it to help people. Inventors have a hard job and often don’t get much credit. But they enjoy using their minds and knowing they help people survive tough times.

For me, thinking and inventing has been a great joy. I have spent almost all my awake time working with my thoughts. Some say I work very hard, and maybe I do if thinking counts as work. But if work means doing a set task at a set time, then I might be lazy. I never felt forced to work; thinking made me feel alive.

I want to share my story in these articles, with help from the Editors of the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER. I especially want to speak to young people. I will talk about my childhood and experiences that shaped my career, even if it’s a bit hard.

When we are little, we act on feelings and imagination without rules. As we grow up, we start to think more carefully and make plans. But those first feelings are very important and can change our future. I now think if I had paid more attention to them, I could have done even more. I didn’t realize I was an inventor until I became an adult.

There were many reasons for this. First, I had a very special brother who was very smart—so smart that scientists still don’t understand how. When he died young, my parents were very sad. We had a horse, a strong Arabian, given by a good friend. The horse was smart and loved by the family. One winter night, the horse saved my father’s life. My father was traveling through wolf-filled mountains when the horse got scared and threw him off. The horse came home hurt and bleeding, then ran back to find my father. My father was unconscious but woke up and got back on the horse, not knowing he had been in the snow for hours. The horse helped the rescue team find him.

Sadly, the same horse caused my brother’s injury that led to his death. I saw this happen, and even after 56 years, I still remember it clearly. Because my brother was so talented, I felt like I wasn’t good enough.

Whenever I did something good, it just made my parents feel sadder about losing my brother. So I didn’t believe in myself much. But I wasn’t a dumb kid. I remember once when some important men called Aldermen were walking by while I played with other boys. The oldest man stopped and gave each boy a silver coin. When he reached me, he looked deep into my eyes and said, "You’re too smart, you don’t get anything from me." People also told a funny story about me. I had two old aunts with wrinkly faces. One had two big teeth that would poke me in the cheek every time she kissed me.
