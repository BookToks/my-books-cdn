For example, someone with a phone here can call and talk to anyone else in the world. A small, cheap receiver, about the size of a watch, lets them listen to speeches or music happening far away, whether on land or at sea.

These examples show how amazing this new science is. It makes distance disappear and uses the Earth like a perfect wire for many uses that people have thought of. Because of this, any machine that works with wires nearby can also work without wires over huge distances, limited only by the size of the Earth. This will open up new business opportunities and make old ones much bigger.

The "World-System" is built on some important inventions: 

1. The "Tesla Transformer." This machine creates powerful electrical vibrations, like how gunpowder changed war. It can make currents much stronger than usual and sparks over 100 feet long.

2. The "Magnifying Transmitter." Tesla’s best invention, this special transformer makes the Earth vibrate with electricity. It’s like how a telescope helps us see far away in space. With it, Tesla has made electrical energy stronger than lightning and sent enough power to light over 200 lamps around the world.

3. The "Tesla Wireless System." This includes improvements that let electrical energy be sent over long distances without wires, and it’s the only cheap way to do this.

Tests at Tesla’s lab in Colorado show that power can be sent anywhere on Earth with very little loss.

4. The "Art of Individualization." This invention is like tuning a radio perfectly. It lets messages be sent privately and clearly, so signals don’t mix or interfere. Each signal is unique, and many stations can work at once without disturbing each other.

5. "The Terrestrial Stationary Waves." This discovery means the Earth reacts to certain electrical vibrations like a tuning fork reacts to sound. These vibrations can power many important uses for business and other things.

The first "World-System" power plant could start working in nine months. It can reach power levels up to ten million horsepower and is designed to handle many technical jobs without costing too much.

Some of these jobs include: (1) connecting telegraph offices all over the world; (2) setting up secret government telegraph services; (3) linking all phone offices globally; (4) sharing news everywhere by telegraph or phone with the Press; (5) creating a private "World-System" for sending information; (6) connecting stock market tickers worldwide; (7) building a global system to share music, and more.
