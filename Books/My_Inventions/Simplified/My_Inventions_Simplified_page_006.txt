I would never touch other people’s hair unless someone forced me with a gun. Just looking at a peach could give me a fever, and if there was camphor in the house, it made me really uncomfortable. Even now, some of these strange feelings still bother me. When I drop little pieces of paper into liquid, I get a weird and awful taste in my mouth. I counted my steps while walking and measured how much soup plates, coffee cups, and food held — if I didn’t, I couldn’t enjoy my meal. Everything I did had to be in groups of three, and if I messed up, I had to start over, even if it took hours.

Until I was eight years old, I was weak and unsure of myself. I didn’t have the courage to make strong decisions. My feelings changed all the time, swinging between extremes. My wishes felt very strong and kept growing like the heads of the hydra. I was scared of pain, death, and religion. I believed in superstitions and was always afraid of evil spirits, ghosts, and monsters in the dark. Then, all of a sudden, something big changed my whole life. 

I loved books more than anything. My dad had a big library, and whenever I could, I tried to read as much as possible. But he didn’t allow it and would get angry if he caught me. He even hid the candles because he didn’t want me to ruin my eyes. So, I made my own candles and read secretly every night, often until dawn, while everyone else was asleep and my mom started her hard work for the day. One time, I found a novel called "Abafi" (the Son of Aba), which was a Serbian translation of a famous Hungarian writer’s book. This book helped me find willpower, and I started practicing self-control. At first, my promises to myself didn’t last, but soon I got stronger and felt a new kind of happiness—the joy of doing what I wanted. Over time, this habit became natural. At first, I had to fight my wishes, but later my desires and will were the same. After years of practice, I controlled myself so well that I could handle passions that ruined many strong people.

At one point, I became obsessed with gambling, which worried my parents a lot. Playing cards was the best thing ever for me. My dad lived a good, careful life and couldn’t accept how I wasted time and money. I had strong willpower, but my thinking was flawed. I told my dad, “I can stop anytime I want, but is it worth giving up something that feels like paradise?” My dad often got angry, but my mom was different. She understood people and knew that only we can save ourselves. One afternoon, after I lost all my money and wanted to play more, she gave me some bills and said, “Go have fun. The sooner you lose everything, the better. I know you’ll get over it.” 

She was right. I beat my gambling habit right then and there and wished it had been stronger so I could have beaten it many times over. I didn’t just beat it—I tore it out of my heart so I wouldn’t want it again. Since then, I don’t care about gambling at all, just like I don’t care about picking my teeth.

At another time, I smoked too much and almost ruined my health. But my willpower saved me, and I stopped smoking completely and lost all desire for it. I once had heart problems until I found out it was caused by my daily cup of coffee. I stopped drinking coffee, though it was hard. This way, I controlled and stopped other bad habits, and not only stayed healthy but also felt great about what most people would see as giving up things they love.

After finishing school at the Polytechnic Institute and University, I had a serious nervous breakdown. While I was sick, I saw many strange and unbelievable things.
