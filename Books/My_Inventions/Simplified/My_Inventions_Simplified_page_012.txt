III. My Later Efforts: Discovering the Rotating Magnetic Field

When I was ten, I started at the Real Gymnasium, a new school with good equipment.

In the physics section, there were many models of old scientific machines, both electrical and mechanical. The teachers’ experiments really amazed me and made me want to invent things. I also loved math and often got praised by my teacher for doing quick calculations. This was because I could picture numbers and problems in my head, not just guess the answers. Up to a certain point, it didn’t matter if I wrote the math on the board or just saw it in my mind. But I really did not like freehand drawing, even though we spent many hours on it. This was strange because most of my family were good at drawing. Maybe I just liked thinking quietly more. If it weren’t for a few classmates who were much worse, my drawing would have been the worst. This was a big problem because drawing was required, and it almost ruined my school progress. My dad had a lot of trouble getting me moved from one class to another because of it.

In my second year at the school, I got obsessed with the idea of making something move forever using steady air pressure. A story I told before about a pump had fired up my imagination and made me believe a vacuum had endless power. I really wanted to use this energy, but I didn’t know how at first. Finally, I invented something that I thought no one else had tried before.

Picture a cylinder that can spin freely on two supports. It’s partly surrounded by a rectangular trough that fits it perfectly. The open side of the trough is closed by a wall, so the part of the cylinder inside splits the trough into two airtight sections. One side is sealed and pumped empty of air, while the other side stays open. I thought this would make the cylinder spin forever. I made a wooden model very carefully, and when I used a pump on one side, I saw it start to turn. I was over the moon with excitement.

I really wanted to build a flying machine, even though I remembered a bad fall I had when I jumped from a building using an umbrella. Every day, I imagined flying to faraway places but didn’t know how I was doing it. Now I had a real machine with just a spinning shaft, flapping wings, and a vacuum with unlimited power! From then on, I pictured myself flying in a comfortable, fancy vehicle fit for a king. It took years before I realized that air pressure pushes at right angles to the cylinder’s surface and that the small turning I saw was actually because of a leak. Learning this was a painful disappointment.

Right after finishing school, I got very sick with many illnesses, so bad that doctors gave up on me. During this time, I was allowed to read a lot. I got books from the Public Library, which needed organizing, so I helped sort them and make lists. One day, I was given some new books I had never seen before, and they were so interesting that I forgot how sick I was. They were early books by Mark Twain, and maybe reading them helped me get better. Twenty-five years later, when I met Mr. Clemens (Mark Twain’s real name) and became friends with him, I told him this story. I was surprised to see the great funny man start to cry.
