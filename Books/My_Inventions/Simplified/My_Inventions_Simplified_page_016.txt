I will always regret that I didn’t have experts in body and mind care watching over me back then. I fought hard to stay alive but never thought I would get better. Can you believe that someone so broken could turn into a person with amazing strength and determination, able to work for thirty-eight years almost every day, and still feel strong and sharp? That’s my story. Wanting to live and keep working, plus help from a loyal friend who was an athlete, made this miracle happen.

My health came back, and so did my mental energy. When I started working on the problem again, I almost wished it wouldn’t end so soon because I had so much energy. When I began, it wasn’t just a decision like many people make. For me, it was a serious promise, a matter of life or death. I knew I would die if I failed. Now I felt like I had won the fight. The answer was deep in my mind, but I couldn’t show it yet. 

One afternoon, which I remember clearly, I was walking with my friend in the City Park, saying poems out loud. At that time, I knew whole books by heart, word for word. One was Goethe’s "Faust." The sun was setting and reminded me of a beautiful part: "The glow retreats, done is the day of toil; It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring; Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil Upon its track to follow, follow soaring! A glorious dream! though now the glories fade. Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me."

As I said these inspiring words, the idea hit me like lightning and suddenly I understood the truth. I drew diagrams in the sand with a stick, the same ones I showed six years later to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and my friend understood them perfectly. The images I saw were sharp and clear, solid like metal and stone. I even told him, "See my motor here; watch me reverse it." I can’t explain how I felt. It was like the statue coming to life in the story of Pygmalion. I would have given up a thousand secrets of nature I might have found by accident for this one I had fought so hard to discover, risking my life.
