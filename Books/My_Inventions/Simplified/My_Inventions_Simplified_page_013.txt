I continued my studies at a high school called the Real Gymnasium in Carlstadt, Croatia, where one of my aunts lived. She was a respected lady, married to a Colonel who had fought in many battles. I will never forget the three years I spent at their home. It was like living in a strict fortress during war. I was fed like a tiny bird. All the meals were very tasty and made with care, but the portions were super small. The ham slices my aunt cut were as thin as tissue paper. When the Colonel tried to put some real food on my plate, my aunt would quickly take it away and say, “Be careful, Niko is very delicate.” I was always very hungry and it was really hard for me. But I lived in a home full of culture and art, which was unusual for those times and places.

The land around was low and swampy, and I kept getting malaria even though I took lots of medicine for it. Sometimes, the river would flood and push a huge group of rats into the buildings. They ate everything, even the bundles of spicy paprika. For me, these rats were a fun distraction. I hunted them in all kinds of ways and became known as the rat-catcher in the town. Finally, I finished my studies, my hard time was over, and I got my graduation certificate, which brought me to a big decision in life.

During all those years, my parents were sure I should become a priest, which scared me a lot. I had gotten really interested in electricity because of my Physics teacher. He was clever and showed us amazing experiments with machines he made himself. I remember one device that was like a bulb covered in tin foil, which spun really fast when hooked up to a static machine. I can’t explain how strong my feelings were watching these cool experiments. Every demonstration made me want to learn more about this amazing power. I wanted to experiment and discover new things, but I felt stuck and sad about what my parents wanted for me.

Just as I was getting ready to go home, I got a message that my father wanted me to go on a hunting trip. This was strange because he had always been against hunting. A few days later I found out there was a cholera outbreak in that area. Taking the chance, I went to Gospic even though my parents didn’t want me to. People had no idea what caused cholera. They believed it spread through the air with bad smells and smoke. Meanwhile, they drank dirty water and many died. I caught the terrible disease the day I arrived. Although I survived the worst part, I was bedridden for nine months and could barely move. I was so weak that I almost died again. During one really bad moment, my father came into my room. I still see his pale face as he tried to comfort me, even though he was scared too.

I said, “Maybe I will get better if you let me study engineering.” He promised, “You will go to the best technical school in the world,” and I believed him. I felt a huge relief, but it came just in time because a special bitter bean medicine helped me recover like a miracle. Everyone was amazed.

My father wanted me to spend a year doing healthy outdoor exercises, which I didn’t want to do at first but agreed. Most of that year I spent in the mountains, carrying hunting gear and books. Being in nature made me stronger in both body and mind. I thought a lot and made many plans, but most were not real. I had clear ideas but little knowledge of how things really worked. One of my inventions was a plan to send letters and packages across seas through a submarine tube, using strong round containers to resist the deep water pressure. I even designed a pump to push water through the tube and worked out many details carefully. But I ignored one small, unimportant detail: I just guessed the water speed and made it very high, which made the whole idea seem amazing and perfect with my calculations.
