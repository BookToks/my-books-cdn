For a while, I spent all my time happily imagining machines and coming up with new designs. It was one of the happiest times in my life.

Ideas kept coming non-stop, and the only problem was trying to remember them all. The machines I thought of felt so real to me, down to the tiny scratches and signs of use. I loved imagining the motors running all the time because it made the picture in my mind even more exciting. When you really want something, you can move toward your goal super fast. In less than two months, I created almost all the types of motors and system changes that are now linked to my name.

It was maybe lucky that life forced me to stop this intense thinking for a while. I went to Budapest because of an early report about a telephone business, but by bad luck, I had to take a job as a draftsman at the Hungarian Government’s Central Telegraph Office for a salary I’d rather not say! Luckily, I soon got the attention of the boss, and after that, I worked on calculations, designs, and estimates for new setups. When the Telephone Exchange started, I was put in charge of it.

The knowledge and experience I got from this work were very valuable, and the job gave me many chances to invent new things. I made some improvements to the Central Station equipment and created a telephone repeater or amplifier that was never patented or shared but would still bring me credit today. Because of my good work, the project’s leader, Mr. Puskas, offered me a job in Paris when he sold his business in Budapest, and I happily accepted.

I will never forget how amazed I was by the magic city of Paris. For days after I arrived, I wandered the streets, completely amazed by everything I saw. There were so many fun and interesting things, but sadly, I spent all my money as soon as I got it.

When Mr. Puskas asked how I was doing, I told him honestly, “the last twenty-nine days of the month are the toughest!” I lived a pretty hard life, what people now might call “Rooseveltian.” Every morning, no matter the weather, I walked from where I lived on Boulevard St. Marcel to a bathhouse by the Seine River. I jumped into the water, swam around twenty-seven times, then walked an hour to Ivry where the company’s factory was. I ate a big, simple breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and then waited for lunch while cracking hard nuts for the factory manager, Mr. Charles Batchellor, who was a close friend and helper of Edison. There, I met some Americans who really liked me because I was good at billiards. I told them about my invention, and one of them, Mr. D. Cunningham, who was the Mechanical Department Foreman, offered to start a stock company for it. This idea seemed funny to me because I didn’t understand what it meant except that it was an American way of doing business.

Nothing happened with that, and over the next few months, I had to travel around France and Germany fixing problems with power plants. When I came back to Paris, I gave a plan to one of the company’s leaders, Mr. Rau, to improve their dynamos. They gave me a chance, and I succeeded completely. The happy directors let me develop automatic regulators that they really wanted.

Soon after, there was trouble with the lighting system at the new train station in Strassburg, Alsace. The wiring was bad, and during the opening ceremony, part of a wall blew out because of a short circuit right in front of old Emperor William I. The German Government refused to accept the system, and the French Company was about to lose a lot of money. Because I knew German and had experience, they trusted me to fix the problem. So, early in 1883, I went to Strassburg on that mission.
