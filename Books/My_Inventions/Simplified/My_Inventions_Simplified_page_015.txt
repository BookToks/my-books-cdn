In my second year of school, we got a Gramme dynamo from Paris. It had a horseshoe-shaped magnet and a wire-wound armature with a commutator.

We connected it and showed different effects of the electric currents. While Prof. Poeschl was demonstrating, running the machine like a motor, the brushes caused problems and sparked a lot. I thought it might be possible to run a motor without those parts. But he said it couldn’t be done and even gave a lecture explaining why. He said, "Mr. Tesla might do great things, but he will never do this. It’s like trying to turn a steady pull, like gravity, into spinning motion. It’s a perpetual motion idea, which is impossible." 

But sometimes, instinct is stronger than knowledge. We have feelings that help us see the truth when logic or thinking hard doesn’t work. At first, I doubted myself because of the professor’s authority, but soon I was sure I was right and started working on it with all the energy and confidence of youth.

I began by imagining a direct-current machine, running it in my mind and watching how the currents changed in the armature. Then I pictured an alternator and studied it the same way. Next, I imagined systems with motors and generators and tried different ways to make them work. The pictures in my mind felt real and clear. I spent the rest of my time at school in Gratz doing this hard mental work, but I didn’t find a solution and almost gave up.

In 1880, I went to Prague, Bohemia, to finish my studies at the university, as my father wanted. There, I made some progress by taking the commutator away from the machine and studying what happened, but still no success. The next year, my views about life changed a lot. I realized my parents had made too many sacrifices for me, and I wanted to help them. The American telephone system was just coming to Europe and was going to be set up in Budapest, Hungary. It seemed like a perfect chance, especially since a family friend was in charge of the project. That’s when I had a complete nervous breakdown.

What I went through during that illness is hard to believe. My sight and hearing were amazing. I could see things far away when no one else could. As a kid, I saved neighbors’ houses from fire by hearing faint crackling sounds that didn’t wake them up, and then calling for help.

In 1899, when I was over forty and doing experiments in Colorado, I could hear thunder from 550 miles away. My young helpers could only hear it from about 150 miles. My hearing was more than thirteen times better than theirs. But even then, I was “stone deaf” compared to how sharp my hearing was when I was so nervous in Budapest. I could hear a watch ticking through three rooms. A fly landing on a table made a soft thud I could hear. A carriage passing miles away shook my whole body. The whistle of a train twenty or thirty miles away made my chair shake so much it hurt. The ground under me was always trembling. I had to put my bed on rubber cushions just to rest. Loud noises around me sometimes seemed like words that scared me, but I could break them down into random sounds. When the sun’s rays were blocked and unblocked, it felt like blows to my brain that made me dizzy. Walking under bridges or other structures caused a heavy pressure on my head. In the dark, I felt like a bat and knew if something was nearby because of a weird feeling on my forehead. My heart rate jumped from very slow to 260 beats per minute, and my whole body shook with twitches and tremors, which was the hardest part to deal with. A famous doctor gave me daily large doses of medicine called Bromide of Potassium and said my illness was one of a kind and couldn’t be cured.
