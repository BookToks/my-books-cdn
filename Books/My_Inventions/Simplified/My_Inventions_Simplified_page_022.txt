So, a transformer was made to test the idea, and the first try was an amazing success. It’s hard to understand how incredible these things seemed back then.

We always want new experiences but quickly get used to them. Things that were amazing before become normal. When I first showed my tubes to the public, people were amazed in ways I can’t even describe. I got invitations and honors from all over the world, but I said no to all of them.

In 1892, the requests became too much, so I went to London and gave a talk to the Institution of Electrical Engineers. I planned to go straight to Paris after that, but Sir James Dewar asked me to speak at the Royal Institution first. I was determined but couldn’t say no to the famous Scotsman. He sat me down and gave me half a glass of a special brown drink that sparkled with colors and tasted amazing.

He said, “Now you’re sitting in Faraday’s chair, drinking the whiskey he used to enjoy.” It was a cool experience. The next night, I gave a demonstration there, and after it, Lord Rayleigh spoke kindly about me. His words gave me hope. I left London and later Paris to avoid attention and went home, where I got very sick. After I got better, I started planning to work again in America. Before then, I didn’t think I was especially good at discovering things, but Lord Rayleigh, a scientist I admired, said I was. That made me want to focus on a big idea.

One day, while walking in the mountains, I tried to find shelter from a coming storm. The sky got dark with heavy clouds, but the rain didn’t start right away. Suddenly, there was lightning, and shortly after, heavy rain. This made me think.

It was clear the lightning and rain were connected, like cause and effect. After thinking about it, I realized that the electricity in the rain was small. The lightning worked like a sensitive trigger.

This was an amazing opportunity. If we could make electric effects like that, we could change the whole planet and life on it.

The sun makes ocean water rise, and winds move it around, keeping it balanced. If we could control this balance when and where we wanted, we could water dry deserts, create lakes and rivers, and make endless power. This would be the best way to use the sun’s energy for people. But to do this, we needed to create electric forces like those in nature. It seemed almost impossible, but I decided to try. When I got back to the U.S. in 1892, I started working on it, especially since I also needed this kind of technology to send energy without wires.

In spring 1893, I reached about 1,000,000 volts with my coil. That wasn’t much compared to today, but back then it was a big deal. I kept making progress until my lab burned down in 1895, as described by T. C. Martin in Century Magazine. This disaster slowed me down a lot, and I spent most of that year rebuilding. But as soon as I could, I got back to work.

I knew I could get higher voltages with bigger machines, but I felt it could be done with a smaller, well-designed transformer. While testing a flat spiral coil, like in my patents, I was surprised there were no sparks. I soon found out this was because of how the coil’s loops were placed and how they worked together. Using this idea, I used a high-voltage wire with big loops spaced out enough to reduce extra electric effects while stopping too much charge from building up anywhere.
