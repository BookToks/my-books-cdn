Nothing would scare me more than the idea of being hugged by these relatives who were as loving as they were ugly. It happened that while I was being carried in my mother’s arms, they asked me who was prettier between the two of them. After looking closely at their faces, I answered carefully, pointing to one, “This one isn’t as ugly as the other.”

From the moment I was born, I was meant to become a priest, and this idea always bothered me. I wanted to be an engineer, but my father would not change his mind. He was the son of a soldier who fought under Napoleon. Like his brother, who was a math professor, my father had a military education but later became a priest. He was very smart, like a natural scientist, poet, and writer. People said his sermons were as powerful as those of Abraham a Sancta-Clara. He had an amazing memory and often recited long parts of books in many languages. He joked that if some old books were lost, he could bring them back. His writing style was admired for being short, sharp, and full of humor and sarcasm. His funny comments were always unique and showed his personality. For example, there was a cross-eyed worker named Mane who chopped wood. One day, as Mane swung his axe, my father, feeling nervous, told him, “For God’s sake, Mane, don’t hit what you’re looking at, hit what you want to hit.” On another day, my father took a friend for a ride, and the friend’s expensive fur coat rubbed against the carriage wheel. My father told him, “Pull in your coat, you’re ruining my tire.” He often talked to himself and would have lively arguments with his own voice changes. Anyone overhearing might think there were several people in the room.

Although I owe my creativity to my mother, my father’s training helped me a lot. He gave me all kinds of exercises—like guessing what others were thinking, finding mistakes in sentences, repeating long sentences, and doing mental math. These daily lessons were meant to improve memory, reasoning, and especially critical thinking, and they really helped me.

My mother came from one of the oldest families in the country and a family of inventors. Her father and grandfather created many useful tools for home and farm work. She was a truly great woman, brave and strong, who faced many hard times. When she was sixteen, a deadly disease spread through the country. Her father was called away to give last prayers to the dying, and while he was gone, she went alone to help a nearby family who were sick. All five family members died quickly. She bathed them, dressed them, and prepared their bodies with flowers, as was the custom. When her father came back, everything was ready for a proper Christian burial.

My mother was an amazing inventor and could have done great things if she had lived closer to modern life and its many chances. She invented and made all kinds of tools and devices, and wove the finest patterns from thread she spun herself. She even planted the seeds, grew the plants, and separated the fibers on her own.

She worked tirelessly from morning till late at night, and most of the clothes and home decorations were made by her hands. Even after she turned sixty, her fingers were still quick enough to tie three knots in an eyelash.

There was another, even more important reason why I was slow to understand things. When I was a boy, I had a strange problem where I would see images, often with bright flashes of light, that messed up how I saw real things and made it hard to think and act.

These images were pictures of things and places I had actually seen, never things I imagined.

When someone spoke a word to me, I would clearly see the object it meant, and sometimes I couldn’t tell if what I saw was real or just in my mind.
