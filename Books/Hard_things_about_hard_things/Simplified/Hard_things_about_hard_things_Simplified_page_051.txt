Again. But I had learned a lot. It felt like a waste to just do something totally different. Then, I got an idea to create a new kind of venture capital firm.

We will look at this idea in chapter 9. But first, chapters 4 through 8 will share almost everything I learned so far. Youâ€™ll also hear some new stories from my time running Loudcloud and Opsware.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
