Before you start, look over any past performance reviews or written talks about the person’s work to spot any mixed messages you might have given before.

There are three important things to get right:  
1. Be clear about why you’re making this decision. You’ve thought about it a lot, so don’t avoid the truth or make it sound nicer than it is. They deserve to know exactly what you think happened.  
2. Use strong, clear words. Don’t leave things open or uncertain. This isn’t a regular review; it’s a firing. Say things like “I have decided” instead of “I think.”  
3. Have the severance package ready and approved. Once the person hears the news, they’ll stop caring about the company and focus on themselves and their family. Be ready to give them the details about their pay and benefits after leaving.

The person will also want to know how you’ll tell others about this. It’s best to let them decide how the news is shared. Bill Campbell once gave me great advice about firing someone important: “You can’t let them keep their job, but you can let them keep their respect.”

After you tell the person, you need to quickly update the company and your team about the change. Tell people in this order: (1) the person’s direct reports since they’ll be affected the most; (2) other team members who will get questions; and (3) the rest of the company. Try to do all this on the same day, within a few hours.  

When you talk to the direct reports, have a plan ready about who they will report to for now and what will happen next (like hiring a new person, reorganizing, or promoting someone). Usually, the CEO should step in temporarily. If you do this, you need to really act like the boss—hold meetings, one-on-one talks, set goals, and so on. This helps the team keep going smoothly and helps you figure out who to hire next.
