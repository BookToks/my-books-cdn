When you run a company, the results can be much bigger and more serious. Like in life, there are always lots of excuses when CEOs make bad choices.

In life, people say things like “other smart people made the same mistake” or “it was a close call.” CEOs might say, “all my friends wanted to do it” or “the team was against me, so I couldn’t go against them.”

Sometimes people say, “all the cool kids are doing it” or “it was industry best practice; I didn’t realize it was illegal.” Others might say, “it wasn’t perfect, so I never tried to sell our product” or “we never reached the right market fit, so we decided not to compete.”

Every time you make the hard but right choice, you become a little braver. Every time you take the easy but wrong choice, you become a little more afraid. If you are a CEO, these choices shape your company to be brave or scared.

One last thought: in the last ten years, new technology has made it much cheaper to start a company. But being brave enough to build a great company is still just as hard as ever.
