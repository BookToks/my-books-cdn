ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EFFORT This one is simple. To be a top company, you need top effort.

If someone isn’t trying their best, they need to be checked.

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PROMISES Many good companies say “make a promise, keep a promise.” If you agree to do something and don’t, you let everyone down. This can spread and cause problems. Holding people responsible for their promises is important to get things done. But it depends on how hard the promise is. Promising to finish a marketing task or send an email is different from promising to meet a tough engineering deadline. You have to hold people accountable for the easy stuff; the hard stuff is more complicated and depends on results.

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RESULTS This part is tricky. If someone doesn’t deliver what they promised, should you hold them responsible? It depends. It depends on:

Seniority of the employee Experienced people should be better at predicting their results than new people.

Degree of difficulty Some tasks are really hard. For example, selling when your product is worse than competitors during a recession is tough. Building a complicated computer system is hard too. It’s hard to make a good prediction and meet it. When deciding what happens if results aren’t met, you have to think about how hard the task was.

Amount of stupid risk You don’t want to punish people for taking smart risks, but not all risks are smart. There is risk without any real reward.
