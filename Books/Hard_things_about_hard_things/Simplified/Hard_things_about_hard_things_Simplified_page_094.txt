How many people have you fired? Or how would you go about firing someone? These are okay questions, but the real important question is this: When you fired someone, how did you know for sure that the employee understood what the job required and was still not doing it right? The best answer is that the manager clearly explained what was expected when they trained the employee for the job. If you don’t train your people, you don’t have a good way to judge how they’re doing. This means managing how well people perform will be messy and all over the place.

3. Product quality  
Often, founders start companies with big ideas for cool, well-designed products that will fix problems they had in their old jobs. But as the company grows, their perfect product design can turn into a total mess.

Why does this happen? When the company gets successful, they hire new engineers fast but don’t train them right. The new engineers just figure out how to finish their tasks on their own. This usually means copying parts of the old design, which causes the product to feel inconsistent, slow, and confusing. And you thought training costs too much.

4. Employee retention  
When lots of people were quitting at Netscape, I read all the exit interviews to find out why. Leaving money aside, I found two main reasons: People hated their managers because they got no guidance, no chances to grow, and no feedback.

Also, they weren’t learning anything new because the company didn’t help them build new skills.

A great training program can fix both these problems.
