Some employees make products, and some make sales, but the CEO makes decisions. So, the best way to judge a CEO is by how fast and how well they make decisions. Great CEOs make great decisions because they use a mix of smarts, clear thinking, and bravery.

Bravery is very important because CEOs never have all the information they want. When they make a decision, they usually have less than 10% of the info that people study later. This means the CEO has to be brave enough to take a big risk even if they aren’t sure it’s the right choice. The hardest decisions are usually the most important and often upset the CEO’s employees, investors, or customers.

The best decision I ever made was to sell the Loudcloud business and become Opsware. If I had asked my employees, investors, or customers to vote on it, they probably would have said no by a lot.

As a CEO, there’s never enough time to get all the info you want before making a decision. You have to make hundreds of decisions, big and small, every week. You can’t just stop everything to research one decision perfectly.

Because of this, you need to keep learning and collecting information during the company’s daily work. That way, when it’s time to decide, you have as much info as possible.

To get ready for any decision, you have to learn about everything that might affect it.

Ask questions like: What will competitors probably do? What can we do with the technology, and how fast? What are the company’s real strengths, and how can we use them best? How much money risk is there? What problems will we face with our current products?
