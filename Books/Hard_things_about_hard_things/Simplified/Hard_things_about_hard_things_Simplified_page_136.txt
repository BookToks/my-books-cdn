People who see things as “me” might talk about their old job like this: “My last job was my e-commerce play. I wanted to make my résumé better.” They say “my” to make it all about themselves, even if others at the company don’t agree. Some people might even get annoyed by that. People with the right kind of drive usually don’t call their work a “play” because they want to build something real with a team.

They care more about how the company wins than about their own pay or job path. If their old company failed, they often talk about their own mistakes and what they did wrong.
