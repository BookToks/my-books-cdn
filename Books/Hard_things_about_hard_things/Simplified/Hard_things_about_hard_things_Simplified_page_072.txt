DEMOTING A LOYAL FRIEND

When I started Loudcloud, I hired the best people I knew—people I respected, trusted, and liked. Like me, many of them didn’t have a lot of experience in the jobs I gave them, but they worked super hard to learn and helped the company a lot. But then the day came when I had to hire someone else, someone with more experience, to do the job my loyal friend was doing before. Man, how do you even do that?

SHOULD YOU DO IT AT ALL?

The first question you ask is, “Do I really have to do this?”

Who else could work this hard and care about the company like my friend? Sadly, if you’re asking, you probably already know the answer. If you want to build a big sales team all over the world, your buddy who did the first deals probably isn’t the best pick. As hard as it is, you need to think about everyone else first, then your friend. Sometimes, what’s best for the group is more important than what’s best for one person.

HOW DO YOU BREAK THE NEWS?

Once you decide, telling your friend won’t be easy. You need to remember two big feelings they’ll have: Embarrassment and Betrayal.

Embarrassment is huge. Everyone knows your friend’s job and how hard they worked. How will they explain to their friends and family that they’re no longer part of the top team?

Betrayal is also strong. Your friend will feel like, “I’ve been with you from the start, worked right beside you. How could you do this to me?”
