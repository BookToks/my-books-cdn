TITLES AND PROMOTIONS

When I meet with startups, many employees don’t have job titles. This makes sense because everyone is just trying to build the company. People do lots of different tasks, so roles aren’t clearly defined. This kind of place has no office politics, and no one is competing for power or status. It’s actually pretty nice.

But why do companies eventually create job titles? And how should they be managed? (Thanks to Mark Zuckerberg for helping me think about this.)

WHY DO TITLES MATTER?

There are two big reasons why companies need job titles:

1. Employees want them. Even if you plan to stay at your company forever, some employees will want titles for their future jobs. For example, if the head of sales applies for a new job, she won’t want to say her title was “Dude,” even if she led a big sales team.

2. People need to know who does what. When a company gets bigger, not everyone knows each other. Employees won’t always know who to work with or what people do. Job titles help explain roles quickly. Customers and business partners can also use titles to understand how to work with the company.

Besides these reasons, employees use titles to compare their value and pay with others. For example, if a Junior Engineer thinks she’s better than a Senior Architect, she might feel she’s getting paid too little. Because titles affect how people see their worth, they need to be handled carefully.
