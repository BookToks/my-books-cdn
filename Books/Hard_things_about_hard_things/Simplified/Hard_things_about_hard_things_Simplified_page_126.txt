— CHAPTER 6 — ABOUT KEEPING THE BUSINESS GOING

“This ain’t for no fake people. If you’re real, then roll with me.” —TRINIDAD JAMES, “ALL GOLD EVERYTHING”

One day during a staff meeting back when I worked at Loudcloud/Opsware, someone brought up a problem that had been bothering them for a while. “This place has way too much swearing. It’s making a lot of people uncomfortable.” Others agreed: “It makes the workplace feel unprofessional. We need to stop it.” Even though the complaints were kind of vague, it was obvious they were aimed at me because I was the biggest swearer in the company and maybe even in the whole industry.

Back then, I led the team with so much urgency that it was rare for me to say more than a few sentences without dropping a curse word somewhere.

Part of it was on purpose. I only had a little time with each employee, and it was super important that I was really clear. Nothing makes things clearer than a few strong curse words. Saying “That is not the priority” is way weaker than “That is not the fucking priority.” When the CEO swears, it gets talked about and repeated. That’s good if you want your message to spread across the company. (But it’s really bad if you don’t want your employees to start talking like rappers.) But part of it was also not on purpose. By then, I could barely control myself. Running that company was really hard, and I had developed what I called CEO Tourette’s syndrome—the swearing just came out without me meaning it.

Since the complaints were serious and from many people, I had to think about them carefully. That night, I thought hard and realized this:

In tech companies, some employees are okay with swearing, but others really aren’t.
