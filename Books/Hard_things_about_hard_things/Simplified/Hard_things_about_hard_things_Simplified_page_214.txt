At Opsware, we started out in the server automation business. When we got our first questions and offers for the company, we had less than fifty customers. I thought there were at least ten thousand potential customers, and we had a good chance to be number one. I also believed we could grow into networks and storage (data center automation) faster than others and win that market too. So, if we had 30% of the market, someone would have to pay sixty times what we were worth to buy our future potential. Not surprisingly, no one was willing to pay that.

Later, when we grew to a few hundred customers and moved into data center automation, we were still number one and more valuable on our own than any previous offers. By then, both Opsware and our main competitor, BladeLogic, had become big companies with worldwide sales teams and professional services. This mattered because a big company buying one of us could actually succeed. Usually, big companies struggle with small purchases because the most important stuff is how sales are done, and big companies canâ€™t easily build that.

Then, it became clear that BMC was going to buy either Opsware or BladeLogic. So, the idea of whether Opsware was number one had to change: 1. We had to be number one in the systems and network management market, not just data center automation, because data center automation was becoming part of a bigger market. 

2. To be number one, we had to beat BMC and BladeLogic combined, which was way harder than beating either company alone.

Also, the market was changing because of a big technology shift called virtualization. Virtualization meant the whole market had to change, so we started a new race to create the best tools for managing virtual environments. This meant we would have to wait a long time before making a profit.

Because of all this, it made sense for us to at least think about the next steps.
