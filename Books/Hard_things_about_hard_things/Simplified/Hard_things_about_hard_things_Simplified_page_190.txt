More complicated tasks like writing reviews, taking away responsibilities, dealing with office politics, deciding pay, and firing people will either be impossible or done really badly.

Giving feedback is the basic skill that management is built on, but it doesn’t come naturally. So how do you get good at something that feels unnatural?

THE SHIT SANDWICH  
A popular and sometimes useful way to give feedback is called the Shit Sandwich. Experienced managers talk about it a lot. It’s explained well in the classic book The One Minute Manager.

The idea is that people listen better if you start by saying something nice (slice of bread one), then tell them the tough criticism (the shit), and finish by reminding them you appreciate their good qualities (slice of bread two). This method helps focus on the behavior, not the person, because you show you value them from the start. This is really important when giving feedback.

The shit sandwich works okay with new employees but has some problems. It feels too formal because you have to plan it carefully, so the person might feel judged.

After doing it a few times, it stops feeling real. The employee thinks, “Here comes the fake compliment, and then the bad news.” Senior managers can spot this right away, and it makes things worse.

Early in my career, I tried giving a perfect shit sandwich to a senior worker, but she just looked at me like I was a kid and said, “Skip the compliments, Ben, just tell me what I did wrong.” That’s when I realized maybe being a CEO wasn’t for me.
