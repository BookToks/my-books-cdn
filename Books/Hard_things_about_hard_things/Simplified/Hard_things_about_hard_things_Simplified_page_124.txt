REQUIREMENTS TO BE GREAT AT RUNNING HR  

What kind of person should you hire to really understand how good your management team is? Here are some important things to look for:  

World-class process design skills  
Just like the head of quality control, the head of HR must be really good at creating and managing processes. Good process design helps measure how well management is doing.  

A true diplomat  
No one likes a tattletale, and HR can’t do a good job if managers don’t trust them. Managers need to feel that HR is there to help them get better, not to catch them doing something wrong. Great HR leaders want to help managers and don’t care about taking credit for finding problems. They work with managers to fix things and only tell the CEO if it’s really needed. If an HR leader keeps information to themselves, tries to get power, or plays office politics, they won’t be helpful.  

Industry knowledge  
Things like pay, benefits, and hiring rules change fast. The head of HR must know a lot about the industry and keep up with the newest trends.  

Intellectual strength to be the CEO’s trusted adviser  
None of the other skills matter if the CEO doesn’t fully support the HR leader in making sure managers do a good job. For this to happen, the CEO must trust the HR leader’s ideas and decisions.
