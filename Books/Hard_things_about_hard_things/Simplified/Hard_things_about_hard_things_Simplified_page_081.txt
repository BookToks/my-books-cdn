All the time and energy you spend thinking about how bad things are would be much better used trying to find that one way to fix your problems.

Donâ€™t waste any time worrying about what you could have done. Instead, focus all your energy on what you can do now. 

In the end, no one really cares about the past; just keep running your company.
