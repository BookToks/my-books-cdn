Balance sheet. Or at least, that was one way to see it. Another way, which the company had to officially say, was that we still had plenty of money in the bank and were signing up big customers really fast. So, which one was true? Without anyone to talk to, I asked myself this question about three thousand times. (By the way, asking yourself something three thousand times is not a good idea.) I had two really tough questions:

1. What if the official story was wrong? What if I was tricking everyone, from investors to employees? If that was true, I should be fired right away.

2. What if the official story was right? What if I was just stressing out for no reason? What if I was messing up the company by doubting myself? If that was true, I should still be fired right away.

Usually, you can’t know which story is true until much later. It turned out that neither story was exactly right. The new customers didn’t save us, but we found another way to survive and succeed. The important thing was not to get stuck believing only the good story or the bad story.

My friend Jason Rosenthal became CEO of Ning in 2010. Right after he took over, he faced a money crisis and had to pick from three really hard options: (1) cut the company’s size a lot, (2) sell the company, or (3) raise money in a way that would make everyone’s ownership smaller.

Think about those choices: 

1. Fire a lot of talented people he worked hard to hire, which would probably make the rest of the team really unhappy.

2. Sell the company and let down all the employees he had worked closely with for years, without giving them a chance to succeed.

3. Make everyone’s share of the company much smaller, so their hard work wouldn’t mean as much money.
