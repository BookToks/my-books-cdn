THE RIGHT KIND OF AMBITION

When startups hire a management team, they usually focus mostly on how smart people are. But having a bunch of smart people with the wrong kind of ambition won’t work. I’ve already said that you should try to hire people with the right kind of ambition. When I talk about this, some people think it’s good advice, while others don’t agree.

At a big-picture level, a company does best when its top managers focus on making the company successful (this is called global optimization) instead of just focusing on their own success (local optimization). No matter how well the CEO sets up rewards, they will never be perfect. Also, things like promotions and owning certain areas aren’t always covered by bonus plans or other tools. If managers have stock or shares in the company, then working to make the company succeed should also help them personally. As my sales head Mark Cranney used to say, “Two percent of zero is zero.” It’s really important that managers have the right kind of ambition because if they don’t, it will make their employees feel less motivated.

As an employee, why would I want to work long hours just to help my manager’s career? If the manager cares more about their own career than the company, that’s what I’d be helping with. Nothing motivates a great employee more than a mission that feels so important it’s bigger than anyone’s personal goals. Because of this, managers with the right kind of ambition are way more valuable than those with the wrong kind. For a full explanation about the problems with the wrong kind of ambition, I recommend reading Dr. Seuss’s story Yertle the Turtle.

It’s hard to perfectly figure out if someone has the right kind of ambition during an interview, but hopefully these ideas will help.

At a big-picture level, everyone sees the world through their own personal view.
