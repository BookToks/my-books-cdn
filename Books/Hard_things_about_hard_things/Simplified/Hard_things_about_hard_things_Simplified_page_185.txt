Bill Campbell used to say to me, “Ben, you’re the best CEO I work with.” That always surprised me because he also worked with Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Eric Schmidt, while my company was struggling a lot. One day, I asked him, “Bill, why do you say that? Don’t results matter?” He told me, “There are lots of good peacetime CEOs and lots of good wartime CEOs, but almost no CEOs who can do both. You’re a peacetime/wartime CEO.”

By my count, I was a peacetime CEO for three days and a wartime CEO for eight years. I still have a hard time forgetting those tough wartime moments. I’m not the only one who feels this way. Dennis Crowley, the founder of Foursquare, said he thinks about this struggle between wartime and peacetime every day. Many tech companies feel the same.

For example, when Eric Schmidt stepped down as CEO of Google and Larry Page took over, many news stories talked about how Page is more shy and quiet compared to Schmidt, who was outgoing and good at speaking for Google. But this missed the bigger point. Schmidt wasn’t just Google’s public face; as a peacetime CEO, he led Google’s huge growth over ten years. Larry Page, on the other hand, seems to think Google is now in a fight for survival, and he wants to be a wartime CEO. This change has affected Google and the whole tech world a lot.

Peacetime in business means when a company is way ahead of others in its main market and the market is growing. During peacetime, the company can focus on making the market bigger and getting stronger.

In wartime, a company is fighting a serious threat that could ruin it. This threat can come from many places, like new competitors, big economic changes, shifts in the market, or problems in the supply chain.
