Decide clearly. Use phrases like “I have decided” instead of “I think” or “I’d like.” This way, the employee won’t feel confused about whether they should try to keep their old job. You can’t just say what they want to hear, but you can be honest.

Be real. If you are a founder-CEO like I was, the employee will probably notice that you are just as inexperienced at your job as they are at theirs. Don’t try to hide this. In fact, admit that if you were a more experienced CEO, you might be able to help them grow into the role, but two people who don’t know what they’re doing is a recipe for failure.

Show you appreciate their work. If you want them to stay in the company, say that clearly. Let them know you want to help them build their career and keep contributing. Tell them you value what they’ve done and that your decision is about the future needs of the company, not about how they did before. If it fits, you can offer a pay raise with the demotion. This will show them they are still important and appreciated.

Remember, it is what it is, and nothing you say will change that or stop it from hurting. Your goal isn’t to make it feel less bad, but to be honest, clear, and effective. Your friend might not like it right away, but over time, they will respect it.
