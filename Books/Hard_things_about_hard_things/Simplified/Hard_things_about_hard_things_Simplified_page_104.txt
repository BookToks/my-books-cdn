When you work at a big company, things usually happen on their own because the company is already moving forward.

But if you’re a startup leader, nothing will happen unless you make it happen. At the start of a company, you need to start eight to ten new projects every day, or the company won’t grow. There’s no momentum yet. Without a lot of effort from you, the company won’t go anywhere.

SO WHAT HAPPENS?

If you hire a big company executive, you might face two big problems: 

1. Rhythm mismatch: This executive is used to waiting for emails, phone calls, and meetings. But in your startup, they’ll be waiting a long time. If they keep waiting like that, your other employees will wonder, “What does this person even do all day?” and “Why did they get so many stock options?”

2. Skill set mismatch: Running a big company needs different skills than building one from scratch. Big company execs are great at making complex decisions, organizing teams, improving processes, and communicating with many people. But when you’re building a startup, there’s no existing structure to fix or organize. You need to be really good at hiring, know your field well, control quality yourself, create new processes from nothing, and come up with fresh ideas and tasks.

HOW CAN YOU STOP THINGS FROM GOING HORRIBLY WRONG?

There are two important steps to avoid disaster:

1. Carefully check for big mismatches when you interview.

2. Make sure you spend as much time helping the new person fit in as you do interviewing them.
