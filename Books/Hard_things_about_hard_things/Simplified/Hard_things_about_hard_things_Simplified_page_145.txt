Phil Jackson, the coach who has won the most NBA championships, was once asked about his famous and unpredictable player Dennis Rodman. Someone asked, "Since Dennis Rodman is allowed to miss practice, does that mean other star players like Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen can miss practice too?" 

Jackson answered, "Of course not. There is only room for one Dennis Rodman on this team. Actually, you can only have a few Dennis Rodmans in the whole world; otherwise, things would get crazy and out of control."

Sometimes, you might have an employee who acts like Dennis Rodman but still helps the company a lot. You might decide to handle their bad side yourself and stop it from hurting the company's culture.

Thatâ€™s okay, but just remember: You can only wait for them for so long.
