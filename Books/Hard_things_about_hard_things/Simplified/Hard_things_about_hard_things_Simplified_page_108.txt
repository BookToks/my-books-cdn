When you’re hiring a head of sales, don’t try to imagine the perfect person and then find someone who matches that idea. This is a bad plan for a few reasons. First, you’re not hiring some random executive for any company. You need the right person for your company right now. For example, the head of sales at Oracle in 2010 might have failed back in 1989.

Also, the VP of engineering at Apple might be totally wrong for Foursquare. The details really matter. Second, your perfect idea of the person is probably wrong. What proof do you have that your idea is right? Last, it’s really hard to teach your interview team to look for something so vague. So, everyone ends up looking for something different.

Instead of looking for someone with no weaknesses, focus on their strengths. The more you work, the more you realize that every employee, including yourself, has problems. Nobody is perfect.

The best way to know what you want is to actually do the job yourself. Not just in name, but by really doing the work. I’ve acted as VP of HR, CFO, and VP of sales in my career. Sometimes CEOs don’t want to do this because they think they don’t know enough. But that’s exactly why they should try—to learn what they need to know. Acting in the role is the only way to understand what kind of person you need to hire, because you want the right person for your company today, not some generic executive.

Besides trying the role yourself, it helps a lot to bring in experts. If you know a great head of sales, interview them first and learn what made them good. Find out which of their skills match your company’s needs. If you can, have that expert help with the interviews. But remember, the expert only knows part of what’s needed. They don’t really know your company well, so you can’t just let them make the decision.

Finally, be clear with yourself about what you expect from this person when they start. What will they do in the first 30 days? What will motivate them to join? Do you want them to build a big team fast, or just hire a couple of people over the next year?
