A GOOD PLACE TO WORK

At Opsware, I used to teach a class about what managers should do because I really believed in training. I made it clear that I expected every manager to meet regularly with their team. I even gave step-by-step instructions on how to have one-on-one meetings so there would be no excuses.

One day, while I was happily doing my job, I found out that one manager hadn’t had a one-on-one meeting with any of his employees for over six months. I always believed in “expect what you check,” but I didn’t expect this. No meetings for over six months? How could I spend so much time thinking about management, making materials, and training my managers, but still have no one-on-ones for half a year?

Wow, so much for the CEO’s power. If this is how the managers listen to me, then why do I even bother coming to work?

I thought leading by example would make the company do what I wanted. The company copied all my bad habits, so why didn’t they copy my good habits? Had I lost the team? I remembered a talk with my dad years ago about Tommy Heinsohn, the Boston Celtics basketball coach then. Heinsohn was one of the best coaches ever, winning coach of the year and two NBA championships.

But then he got worse fast and had the worst record in the league. I asked my dad what happened. He said, “The players stopped paying attention to his angry outbursts. Heinsohn used to yell and the team would respond. Now they just ignore him.” Were my team ignoring me too? Had I shouted at them one time too many?

The more I thought about it, the more I saw that while I told the team “what” to do, I didn’t explain “why” I wanted them to do it. My authority alone wasn’t enough to make them do what I wanted. Since we had so many things to get done, managers couldn’t do everything and made their own priorities. This manager didn’t think meeting with his team was important, and I hadn’t told him why it was important.
