Interviewing with Marc was nothing like any other job interview I’d had before. There were no questions about my résumé, my career path, or how I worked.

Instead, he asked me lots of questions about the history of email, teamwork software, and what might happen in the future. I knew a lot about this stuff because I had worked on the best products in that area for years. But I was surprised by how much a 22-year-old knew about computer history. I had met many smart young people, but never a young tech historian like Marc. His brain and instincts really surprised me. Besides knowing history, he also had sharp ideas about tech like replication. After the interview, I called my brother and told him I had just interviewed with Marc Andreessen, and I thought he might be the smartest person I’d ever met.

A week later, I got the job. I was super happy. I didn’t even care about the salary. I knew Marc and Netscape would change the world, and I wanted to be part of it. I couldn’t wait to start.

When I got to Netscape, I was put in charge of their Enterprise Web Server product line. There were two products: the regular Web server, which cost $1,200, and the secure Web server, which was $5,000. The secure one used a new security system Netscape invented called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). When I joined, there were just two engineers working on the Web servers: Rob McCool, who made the NCSA Web server, and his twin brother, Mike McCool.

By the time Netscape went public in August 1995, the Web server team had grown to about nine engineers. The Netscape IPO was amazing and historic. The stock was first priced at $14 a share, but a last-minute choice doubled it to $28. Then it jumped to $75—a record for a first-day increase—and ended at $58. That gave Netscape a market worth of almost $3 billion on the IPO day. More than that, it shook up the business world. My friend and investment banker Frank Quattrone said, “No one wanted to tell their grandchildren they missed out on this.” The deal changed everything. Microsoft had been around for over ten years before going public; Netscape had only been around 16 months. Companies started to be known as “new economy” or “old economy.” And the new economy was winning. The New York Times even called the Netscape IPO “world-shaking.” But there was a problem: Microsoft said it would include its browser, Internet Explorer, for free with its next big product.
