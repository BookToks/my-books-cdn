If you conduct regular and well-organized reviews of how people perform and get paid, you can make sure raises and stock options are fair. This is very important for top executives because it helps reduce office politics. For example, the CEO should have a clear policy for pay and performance and tell the executive that their pay will be reviewed just like everyone else's. Ideally, the board of directors should be involved in deciding executive pay. This helps keep things fair and makes it harder to make special exceptions.

When you manage ambitious people, sometimes they will want more responsibility. For example, the CFO might want to become the COO. Or the head of marketing might want to run both marketing and sales. Or the head of engineering might want to lead both engineering and product management. When someone brings this up, be very careful about what you say because your words can cause drama and rumors. Usually, it’s best to say nothing. You might ask "why?" but don’t react to their reasons. If you show what you are thinking, the information will leak and cause unproductive gossip. You should review how your team is set up regularly and collect the info you need quietly. Once you decide what to do, act fast and make changes immediately so there’s no time for rumors or lobbying.

Every time someone gets promoted, others at the same level notice and judge if it was earned or if it was because of politics. If they think it’s politics, employees usually react in one of three ways: 1. They feel sad and undervalued. 2. They openly disagree and work against the promoted person. 3. They try to copy the political behavior that got the promotion. You don’t want any of these reactions in your company. So, you need a clear, fair, and open process for promotions that everyone can see and trust. Often, this process needs to be different for different groups of people.
