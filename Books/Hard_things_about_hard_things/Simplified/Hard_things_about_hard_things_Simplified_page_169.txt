TOO MUCH BROKEN STUFF  
Because of all this stress, CEOs often make one of two mistakes:  
1. They take things way too personally.  
2. They don’t take things personally enough.  

In the first case, the CEO gets super serious and stressed about every problem and tries to fix everything right away. Since there are so many problems, this usually leads to one of two outcomes. If the CEO focuses on others, she ends up scaring the team so much that no one wants to work there anymore. If she focuses on herself, she feels so overwhelmed and sick that she can barely go to work.  

In the second case, to avoid feeling bad about all the problems, the CEO acts like everything is fine. She thinks the problems aren’t that serious and don’t need to be fixed fast. This makes her feel better, but she actually doesn’t fix anything. The employees get frustrated because the CEO keeps ignoring important issues. Eventually, the company starts falling apart.  

The best way is for the CEO to be urgent but not crazy. She should act fast and make decisions without getting too emotional. If she can separate how important the problems are from how she feels about them, she won’t blame her employees or herself too much.  

IT’S A LONELY JOB  
When things are really bad as a CEO, talking about big questions about the company’s future with your employees can cause problems. But talking to your board or outside advisers often doesn’t help either. They don’t understand the situation well enough to help you make the right decisions. So, you end up feeling very alone.
