“Just because we missed some goals along the way doesn’t mean we won’t finish our product on time.” In engineering meetings where everyone feels a lot of pressure to deliver on schedule—because of a promise to customers, a deadline for the quarter, or competition—everyone wants to hear good news. When the facts don’t match the good news, a smart manager will find a story to make everyone feel better—until the next meeting.

“We have a lot of people leaving, but once we start email marketing to our users, they will come back.” Sure, right. The reason people leave and don’t come back is that we haven’t been sending them enough annoying emails. That makes total sense to me, too.

Where do lies come from?

To answer that, I thought about a talk I had years ago with the amazing Andy Grove.

Back in 2001, at the end of the Great Internet Bubble, big tech companies were missing their sales goals by a lot. I wondered how none of them saw it coming. After the dot-com crash in April 2000, you’d think companies like Cisco, Siebel, and HP would know they were about to slow down because many customers were struggling. But even with huge warning signs, each CEO kept giving strong promises until they suddenly failed their goals.

I asked Andy why these top CEOs lied about what was coming.

He said they weren’t lying to investors, but lying to themselves.

Andy explained that people, especially those who make things, only listen to good signs. For example, if a CEO hears that more people used her app one month, she gets excited and hires more engineers to handle the expected rush. But if usage drops a lot, she quickly makes excuses: “The site was slow, there were holidays, and we changed the design—that’s why!” Both good and bad signs might be wrong or right, but usually the CEO only acts on good news and ignores bad news by explaining it away.
