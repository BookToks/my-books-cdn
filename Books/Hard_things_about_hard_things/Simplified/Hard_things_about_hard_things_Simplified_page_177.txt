ONES AND TWOS

Jim Collins, in his popular book Good to Great, shows with lots of research that when choosing a new CEO, people from inside the company usually do better than people from outside. The main reason is knowledge. Knowing the technology, past decisions, company culture, and staff is much harder to learn than just managing a bigger company. 

However, Collins doesn’t explain why internal candidates sometimes fail. I will try to explain that. I will focus on two main skills for running a company: First, knowing what to do. Second, getting the company to do what you know. Being a great CEO needs both skills, but most CEOs are better at one than the other. I call the CEOs who like setting the company’s direction “Ones” and those who enjoy making the company work at its best “Twos.”

WHAT ONES LIKE AND DON’T LIKE

Ones like spending most of their time collecting information from many sources, like employees, customers, and competitors. They love making decisions. Even though they prefer to have lots of information before deciding, they can make choices with little info if needed. Ones have sharp strategic minds and enjoy thinking many steps ahead, like playing a tricky game of chess against their best rivals.

Ones sometimes get bored with important details needed to run a company, like designing processes, setting goals, keeping people responsible, training, and managing performance.

Most founding CEOs are Ones. When they fail, it’s often because they never got good enough at the Two skills to manage those activities well. This makes the company too messy to do well, and the CEO ends up getting replaced.
