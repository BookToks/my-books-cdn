IS IT OKAY TO HIRE PEOPLE FROM YOUR FRIEND’S COMPANY?

Every good tech company needs awesome people. The best companies spend a lot of time, money, and effort to become really good at hiring.

But how far should you go to build the best team? Is it okay to hire someone from your friend’s company? Will you still stay friends?

First, what do I mean by “friends”? There are two types: Important business partners and friends. For this talk, friends and important business partners are pretty much the same.

Most CEOs don’t usually try to hire people from their friend’s company. CEOs don’t have many real friends in business, and taking someone from a friend’s company can ruin that friendship. Still, many CEOs face the choice of whether to hire someone from a friend’s company. How does this happen? When is it okay? When will it hurt your friendship?

BUT THEY WERE ALREADY LOOKING

It usually starts like this. Your friend Cathy has a great engineer named Mitchell. Mitchell is friends with one of your top engineers. Your engineer gets Mitchell to come in for an interview without telling you. Mitchell does really well in the interview. The last step is when you, the CEO, interview him. You notice Mitchell works for your good friend Cathy. You check with your team to make sure they didn’t try to hire Mitchell first. They say Mitchell was already looking for a new job and would join another company if not yours. Now what?

You might think, “If Mitchell is leaving, then Cathy should want him to come to my company instead of a competitor.”
