LIES THAT LOSERS TELL

When a company starts losing big battles, the truth is often the first thing to get lost. CEOs and workers try really hard to make up stories that help them avoid facing the real problems. Even though they get creative, many companies end up using the same fake excuses.

SOME FAMILIAR LIES

“She left, but we were going to fire her, or give her a bad review.” High-tech companies usually sort employee leaving into three groups: 1. People who quit 2. People who got fired 3. People who quit, but it’s okay because the company didn’t want them anyway. Interestingly, when companies start having trouble, the third group grows way faster than the first. Also, this sudden wave of “performance-related leaving” happens in companies that say they only hire top talent. How do all these superstar employees suddenly become bad workers? How can a manager say a top employee’s performance dropped just after they leave?

“We would have won, but the other guys gave the deal away.” “The customer picked us because we’re better, but our competitor gave the product for free. We would never sell so cheap because it would hurt our reputation.” Anyone who’s run a sales team has heard this lie. You try hard to win a deal but lose. The sales rep, not wanting to look bad, blames the other company’s “used car salesman” type. The CEO, not wanting to admit the product isn’t competitive, believes it. If you hear this lie, check with the actual customer. I bet it’s not true.
