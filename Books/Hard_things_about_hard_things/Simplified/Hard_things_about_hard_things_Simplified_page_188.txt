A wartime CEO often doesn’t have businesses that are number one or two, so they can’t follow the usual rule.

Can a CEO be good at leading in both peaceful times and tough times?

Some people might say I wasn’t great as a peacetime CEO but did well as a wartime one. John Chambers did well as Cisco’s CEO during peaceful times but had trouble when Cisco faced tough competition from companies like Juniper and HP. Steve Jobs, who used a wartime style of management, stepped down as Apple’s CEO in the 1980s during a long peaceful period but came back later and did amazing work when Apple faced big challenges.

I think the answer is yes, but it’s hard. To be good at both, a CEO has to know a lot of management rules and when to follow them or break them.

Most management books are written by consultants who study companies during peaceful times. So, these books mostly teach how to be a peacetime CEO. Except for books by Andy Grove, I don’t know any that teach how to lead like Steve Jobs or Andy Grove did during tough times.

Going back to the start, a little bit of wartime leadership was exactly what Google needed.

Page’s clear and exact leadership helped Google do great work by bringing its products together, like Android and Google Glass. Sometimes, you just have to fight hard.
