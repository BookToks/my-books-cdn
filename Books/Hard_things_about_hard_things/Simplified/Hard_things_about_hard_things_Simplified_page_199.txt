Twitter doesn’t make much sense and can sometimes cause problems. CEOs should be judged based on the chances and goals of their own company, not someone else’s.

Let me tell you a funny story that shows how a CEO really takes responsibility for delivering results. This story is from Robin Li, the CEO of Baidu, which is the biggest search engine company in China. In a talk he gave at Stanford University in 2009, Robin said that on the day Baidu went public (which is usually one of the most exciting days for a business owner), he was actually scared. Why? Here’s how Robin took responsibility for results: In 2004, they got their last round of investment money from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Google, who were great partners. Then, in 2005, the company went public. The ideal stock price was $27, but on the first day, it closed at $122. This was awesome for many Baidu employees and investors, but it was really stressful for Robin because he was only ready to deliver results that matched a price of $27, maybe $30 or $40. Seeing the price jump to $122 shocked him. That meant he had to work much harder to meet much higher expectations. So he focused hard on running the company well, improving technology, and making the user experience better—and he delivered.

After thinking about all this, we realize that looking only at results compared to goals (called “black box” results) shows what happened in the past. But like mutual funds say, “past performance is no guarantee of future results.” It’s better to judge a CEO by clear ideas—like “Does the CEO know what to do?” and “Can the CEO make the company do it?”—because that helps predict what will happen next.

To finish, evaluating a CEO doesn’t have to be super complicated or unclear. Everyone, including CEOs, will do better if they know what questions they will be asked ahead of time.
