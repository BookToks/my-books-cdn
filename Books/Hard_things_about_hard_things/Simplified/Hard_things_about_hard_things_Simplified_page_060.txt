To build an awesome tech company, you need to hire a lot of really smart people. It’s a waste to have smart people but not let them work on your biggest problems. No matter how smart someone is, they can’t fix a problem if they don’t know it exists. Like the open-source community says, “With enough people looking, all bugs become easy to find.”

A good company culture is like an old internet rule: bad news spreads fast, but good news spreads slow.

If you look at companies that failed, you’ll see many employees knew about big problems before those problems destroyed the company. So why didn’t they say anything?

Most of the time, it’s because the company culture didn’t allow bad news to spread, so the problems stayed hidden until it was too late.

A healthy company culture lets people share bad news. A company that talks openly about its problems can fix them quickly. But a company that hides problems just makes everyone unhappy. So, CEOs should create a culture that rewards people for bringing up problems instead of punishing them.

Also, be careful about management rules that stop information from moving freely. For example, the old saying “Don’t bring me a problem without a solution” can be a problem. What if the employee can’t fix the problem? Like if an engineer finds a serious issue with the product’s marketing, do you want them to hide that? These sayings might sound good, but they can block important information, which is bad for the company.

FINAL THOUGHT: If you run a company, you’ll feel a lot of pressure to always be super positive. Don’t give in to that pressure. Be brave, face the truth, and say things like they really are.
