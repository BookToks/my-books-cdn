Before figuring out how much work we needed to do inside the company, we checked out other companies first.

Surprisingly, out of the four companies already working on network automation, the one we thought had the best product design, Rendition Networks, made the least money. This made some of our business people doubt our technical review. But I learned that common beliefs aren’t always true, and the idea that markets always know the right price is wrong. How else could Opsware be worth half the cash we had in the bank when we had a $20 million a year contract and fifty of the smartest engineers in the world? Markets don’t always find the truth; they just quickly agree on an answer—often the wrong one.

After deciding buying a company was better than building from scratch, we agreed to buy Rendition Networks for $33 million. Within three months after buying them, John made a deal with Cisco Systems—the biggest networking company in the world—to sell our product. Cisco agreed to pay us $30 million upfront for advanced licenses. This one deal almost covered the whole cost of buying Rendition.

Note to self: Always ask, “What am I missing?”

THE BIG DECISION

As we offered more products, our business kept growing. From almost nothing, we built a software company making nearly $150 million a year. Our stock price also went up from just $0.35 per share to trading between $6 and $8 per share, sometimes making the company worth over $800 million.

But things weren’t always easy. Every quarter was a challenge, and the tech and competition were changing fast. A new technology called virtualization was becoming super popular and changing how customers automated their systems. To me, virtualization seemed like the breakthrough that would finally make cloud computing work. On top of that, being a public company wasn’t easy. At one point, a shareholder named Rachel Hyman thought I was too full of myself and wanted the board to fire me and sell the company right away. This was even though our stock was at $7 per share, ten times what she paid for her shares.

Still, I wasn’t planning to quit. Whenever someone wanted to buy us...
