For example, you might want to organize your sales team by product so they can talk better with the right product groups and get really good at selling those products. But if you do that, it might be confusing for customers who buy more than one product because they will have to talk to different salespeople.

With that in mind, here are the basic steps to design an organization:

1. Figure out what needs to be communicated. Start by listing the most important information and who needs to know it. For example, engineers, QA, product managers, marketing, and sales all need to understand how the product works.

2. Figure out what needs to be decided. Think about the decisions that need to be made often, like choosing features, making design choices, or fixing support problems. Design the organization so the right manager can make most of these decisions.

3. Decide which communication and decision paths are the most important. For example, is it more important for product managers to know about the product or the market? Is it more important for engineers to know about customers or the product design? These priorities can change, so you can reorganize if needed.

4. Decide who will lead each group. This step comes after the others. You want to set up the organization to help the people doing the work, not just the managers. Many big mistakes happen when managers’ personal goals come before what’s best for the team. This step might upset some managers, but they will get over it.

5. Identify the communication paths you didn’t focus on. It’s just as important to know which paths you won’t optimize. Ignoring them completely can cause problems later.

6. Make a plan to handle the issues you found in step five. Once you know what problems might happen, you can create processes to fix or reduce them.
