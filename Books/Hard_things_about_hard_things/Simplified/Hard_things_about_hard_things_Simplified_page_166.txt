At first, I wasn’t sure if Herb Allen was just saying, “Leave me alone, I’m not buying some risky stock” like many people in Silicon Valley would. But soon, I found out what he really meant.

Over the next few months, Allen & Company bought a lot of Opsware stock. Herb Allen himself also bought shares, and some of his clients became big investors too. Because of this, the stock price went up from 35 cents to $3 in just a few months. We avoided being kicked off the stock market, got more shareholders, and gave our workers hope. All of this happened because of one meeting with Herb Allen.

Years later, I asked Herb why he believed in our company when almost no one else did. I told him Allen & Company didn’t know much about technology or data center automation back then. Herb said, “I didn’t understand your business or industry well. But I saw two guys come to me when every other CEO was hiding. You were more determined and sure you’d succeed than leaders of huge companies. Investing in courage and determination was easy for me.” That’s how Herb Allen works. If you get the chance, it’s smart to do business with him.

One big lesson I learned as an entrepreneur was to focus on what I needed to get right and stop stressing about what I did wrong or might do wrong. This part shares those lessons and helps you learn how to focus on what really matters.
