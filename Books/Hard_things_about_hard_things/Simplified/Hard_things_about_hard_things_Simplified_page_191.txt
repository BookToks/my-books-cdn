To get really good at giving feedback, you need to go beyond simple tricks like the "shit sandwich." You should find a way to give feedback that fits who you are and what you believe in. Here’s what makes feedback work: Be real. It’s super important that you truly believe what you’re saying and don’t just say things to make the other person feel a certain way.

You can’t pretend to care.

Give feedback for the right reasons. You should want the person to do well, not to mess up. If you want someone to succeed, show them you care. If they feel that you’re on their side, they’ll listen to you.

Don’t make it personal. If you have to fire someone, just do it. Don’t get them ready to be fired by giving bad feedback. Instead, help them get better. If they don’t accept your feedback, that’s a different issue.

Don’t embarrass people in front of others. Sometimes it’s okay to give feedback in a group, but never make someone feel ashamed or humiliated in front of their friends or coworkers. If you do, your feedback won’t help and the person will just hate you.

Be clear, but don’t be mean. Don’t beat around the bush. If you think someone’s presentation was bad, don’t say, “It’s pretty good but could use some work at the end.” It’s better to say, “I didn’t understand your point because of these reasons.” Vague feedback can be worse than no feedback because it confuses people. But don’t attack them or act like you’re better. Good feedback is a conversation, not a speech.

FEEDBACK IS A CONVERSATION, NOT A ONE-WAY TALK. You might be the boss and telling someone what you don’t like, but that doesn’t always mean you’re right. Your
