Facebook’s CEO wouldn’t do a good job running Oracle. And Larry Ellison, who is great at Oracle, wouldn’t be the right person to run Facebook either. If you rush to hire leaders who can handle big challenges before you really need them, you might ignore how well they actually do their job now. This could mean swapping good leaders for worse ones.

You still have to decide who’s right for the job when the company actually grows bigger. Even if you avoid hiring too early or slowing down a new leader’s progress, guessing too soon doesn’t really help.

No matter what you think at one time, you have to rethink things later when you have better information.

Running a company by making decisions with little info isn’t smart. Deciding someone who works hard and does great now won’t stay for years can cause problems. It leads to hiding info, lying, bad communication, wrong judgments, and fights inside the team. Don’t let that happen.

So, if you shouldn’t guess who can grow into bigger roles, how do you decide? Check your team at least every three months in all areas. Two tips can help you avoid guessing who will grow too early: Don’t separate “growth potential” from the rest of the review. The real question is whether the leader can do the job right now. Look at everything together to avoid wrong predictions.

Judge people by comparing them to others, not by some perfect standard. Instead of asking if a leader is the best ever, ask: For this company right now, is there someone better I could hire? If a top competitor hires that person, how will it affect us?

Trying to guess who can grow too much messes up managing, isn’t fair, and doesn’t work.
