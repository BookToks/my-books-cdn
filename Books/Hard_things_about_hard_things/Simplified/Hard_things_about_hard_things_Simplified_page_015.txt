The next day, the hiring manager called me to say they wanted me to interview with the cofounder and Chief Technical Officer, Marc Andreessen.

He was only twenty-two years old at the time.

Looking back, it’s easy to think that the Web browser and the Internet were bound to happen. But without Marc’s work, we might be living in a very different world. Back then, most people thought only scientists and researchers would use the Internet. They believed it was too complicated, unsafe, and slow for real business use. Even after the first browser, Mosaic, came out, almost no one thought the Internet would matter outside of science. The biggest tech leaders were busy making their own private systems.

The main companies competing to control the so-called Information Superhighway were big names like Oracle and Microsoft. The business world loved their stories. This made sense because most companies didn’t even use the Internet’s basic software, called TCP/IP. Instead, they used private systems like AppleTalk, NetBIOS, and SNA. In November 1995, Bill Gates wrote a book called The Road Ahead. He said the Information Superhighway—a network connecting all businesses and customers for easy buying and selling—would replace the Internet and rule the future. Gates later changed the book to talk about the Internet instead, but that wasn’t his first idea.

This private system idea wasn’t good for business or customers. People like Bill Gates and Larry Ellison thought the companies controlling the Information Superhighway would charge fees on every transaction. Microsoft’s chief technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold, even called these fees a “vigorish.”

The idea of the proprietary Information Superhighway was very strong. Even after Mosaic, Marc and his cofounder, Jim Clark, first planned a business for video that would run on the private Information Superhighway, not the Internet. It wasn’t until later that they decided to make the browser better—safer, easier to use, and more useful—so the Internet could become the network of the future. That became Netscape’s goal, and they did an amazing job achieving it.
