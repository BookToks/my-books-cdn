SHOULD YOU SELL YOUR COMPANY?

One of the hardest choices a CEO has to make is whether to sell their company. Figuring out if selling is better in the long run than running it alone involves a lot of things, most of which are uncertain or unknown. And if you started the company, the feelings part is even harder than the thinking part.

It would be much easier if emotions didn’t matter. But selling your company always feels emotional and personal.

TYPES OF ACQUISITIONS

For this talk, it helps to think about tech company sales in three types:

1. Talent and/or technology – when a company is bought just for its people or tech. These deals usually cost between $5 million and $50 million.

2. Product – when a company is bought for its product, but not the whole business. The buyer plans to sell the product as it is, mainly using their own sales and marketing. These deals usually cost between $25 million and $250 million.

3. Business – when a company is bought for the whole business, including revenue and profits. The buyer values everything – product, sales, marketing, and more. These deals can be huge, like Microsoft’s $30 billion offer for Yahoo.

What I’m talking about mostly applies to business acquisitions, a bit to product acquisitions, and not much if you’re just selling people or technology.
