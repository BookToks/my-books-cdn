When you are putting together a team, keep two questions in mind: 1. Who can best help you figure out if the candidate meets what you need? These people can be inside or outside the company. They might be board members, other leaders, or experts.

2. Who do you need to support the decision once the new executive starts?

This second group is just as important as the first. Even if the executive is amazing, they will struggle if the people around them don’t support them. The best way to avoid problems is to know about any issues before hiring.

Some people will be in both groups. Both groups’ opinions are important: group one helps you find the best candidate, and group two helps you see how well the candidate will fit into your company. Usually, group two should only interview the final candidates.

Next, give questions to interviewers based on what they are good at. Make sure the person asking questions really understands what a good answer sounds like.

During the interviews, talk with the interviewer about what happened. Use this time to agree on what you are looking for so you get the best information.

For the final candidates, it’s very important that the CEO does the reference checks personally. Check the references using the same criteria you used in the interviews. Backdoor reference checks (talking to people who know the candidate but weren’t given by the candidate) can give you honest opinions. But don’t ignore the front-door references. Even though they want to give a good review, you are not looking just for positive or negative answers. You want to see if the candidate fits your needs. Often, front-door references know the candidate best and can be very helpful.
