Growing up in Berkeley with grandparents who were Communists probably wasn’t the best way to learn how to run a company. But when I saw my friends’ amazing businesses fail or sell for cheap, I realized I wasn’t the only one having a tough time.

As I got deeper into it, I found out that accepting the unusual parts of my background was the key to getting through. Those things gave me a different way to see and handle business. They were the unique skills I brought to the table that no one else had. For example, I used Chico Mendoza’s surprising but powerful style to motivate and focus the team. I also understood people beyond their looks and personalities, which helped me bring Jason Rosenthal and Anthony Wright together to save the company. Even in the super competitive world of business, I used ideas from Karl Marx that actually made sense. On my grandfather’s grave, there’s a quote from Marx he loved: “Life is struggle.” I think this quote holds the biggest lesson in starting a business: Accept the struggle.

When I work with new business owners today, this is what I try to teach them. Accept your weirdness, your background, and your gut feelings. If the answers aren’t inside you, they don’t exist. I understand what they’re going through, but I can’t tell them what to do. I can only help them find their own way. Sometimes, they even find peace where I couldn’t.

Of course, even with all the advice and looking back, hard things will still be hard. So, to finish, I just want to say peace to everyone fighting to make their dreams come true.
