Understand that in any of these situations, the board will be at least a little worried, and you can’t really stop that. But remember, your choices are: (a) make the board worried or (b) let a bad leader stay in their job. Choice (a) isn’t great, but it’s way better than choice (b). If you let a failing leader stay, a whole department in your company will slowly get worse. If that happens, the board will be even more worried.

You should have three main goals with the board: First, get their support and make sure they understand the tough job you’re about to do. Start by explaining the real problem and your plan to fix it. This will help them trust you to hire and manage other leaders in the future.

Second, get their advice and approval for the separation package. This is very important for the next step. Executive packages are bigger than normal severance packages, and that’s fair because it usually takes an executive much longer to find a new job than regular workers.

Third, protect the reputation of the fired executive. The failure probably wasn’t just their fault—it was likely a team effort. It’s better to say it that way. You don’t look good by trashing someone who worked for you. Handling this maturely will keep the board confident in your ability to be CEO, and it’s also the right and fair thing to do.

Finally, news about firing an executive is best shared through personal phone calls instead of dramatic announcements during a board meeting. It takes more time, but it’s worth it. Personal talks are especially important if a board member introduced the executive to the company. Once everyone agrees privately, you can then finalize the details in a board meeting or call.

STEP 3: PREPARING FOR THE CONVERSATION After you understand what went wrong and have told the board, you should tell the executive as soon as you can. Before that meeting, I suggest writing down or practicing what you want to say so you don’t mess up. The executive will remember this talk for a long time, so you need to handle it carefully.
