Here are six steps that should help you a lot. When we look at more advanced ways to organize a company, we also have to think about things like balancing speed and cost, how to introduce changes in the organization, and how often you should rearrange the company structure.

PROCESS means communication. If your company has only five people, you don’t really need a formal process because you can just talk to each other. You can easily pass tasks along, share important information, and keep everything running smoothly without any complicated rules.

But if your company has four thousand people, talking directly to everyone all the time gets really hard. Random, one-on-one communication won’t work anymore. You need something stronger—a system for communication, which is called a process.

A process is a clear and organized way to communicate. It can be a detailed method like Six Sigma or just a regular, well-planned meeting. The size and type of process should match the communication needs you have.

When people in different parts of a company need to communicate, processes help make sure that communication happens and that it’s done well. If you want to start with one process in your company, try the interview process. It usually involves different departments (like hiring teams and HR), people outside the company (the job candidates), and it’s really important for the company’s success.

Who should create these processes? The people who are already doing the work in a more casual way. They know what needs to be shared and who needs the information.

These people are the best ones to make the process official and able to grow.

When should you start using processes? It depends on your situation, but it’s usually easier to add new people to processes you already have than to introduce new processes to people who don’t know them. Make what you’re doing official so it’s simple to bring new people on board.

There’s a lot already written about how to design processes, so I won’t go into more detail here.
