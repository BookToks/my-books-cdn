Swearing is just like any other kind of language. For example, think about the word ‘cupcakes.’ It’s okay for me to say to Shannon, ‘Those cupcakes you baked look delicious.’ But it’s not okay for me to say to Anthony, ‘Hey, Cupcakes, you look really good in those jeans.’ And that was all I said about that.

After that day, I never heard anyone complain about swearing again, and I don’t think we lost anyone because of the rule. Sometimes, a group doesn’t need a fix; it just needs clear rules. Once I made it clear that swearing was okay — as long as it wasn’t used to scare or bother someone — nobody had a problem with it anymore. At least, not that I knew of. In the end, the rule worked well: people felt comfortable at work, few people left, and no one complained.

Sometimes, the best rule is the one the boss can follow.

As a company gets bigger, it will change. No matter how well you build your culture, keep your energy, or control your growth, your company won’t be the same when it has one thousand people as it was when it had ten. But that doesn’t mean it can’t still be a good company with 1,000, 10,000, or even 100,000 employees. It will just be different. Making it good when it grows big means accepting that it has to change and being ready to make the changes needed so things don’t fall apart. This chapter talks about some of the changes you’ll need to make.
