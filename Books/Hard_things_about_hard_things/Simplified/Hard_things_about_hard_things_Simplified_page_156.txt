TAKING THE MYSTERY OUT OF SCALING A COMPANY

If you want to build a really important company, at some point you have to make it bigger.

People often talk about the magic of how just a few people started Google or Facebook. But today, Google has twenty thousand employees, and Facebook has more than fifteen hundred. So, if you want to create something big, you need to learn how to grow a team.

Board members usually give two pieces of advice about growing a company: 1. Get a mentor. 2. Find experienced leaders who already know how to grow a company.

This advice is okay, but it has some problems.

First, if you don’t know anything about growing a company, it will be hard for you to choose the right people for the job. It’s like trying to find a great coder if you’ve never written code yourself. Second, many investors or board members don’t know much about growing companies either, and they might trust people who have experience but not the real skills. If you’ve worked in a big company, you know there are lots of people who have run them but don’t do it well.

The advice is still good, but the best way to pick great mentors and employees is to first learn the basics yourself. Then you can use different ways to grow your company depending on the situation.

THE BASIC IDEA: GIVE GROUND GRUDGINGLY

When a company gets bigger, things that were easy before become hard. Specifically, things that didn’t cause problems when you were small start to become big challenges as you grow.
