I've never seen someone lose the support of their company and then get it back, based on how well they perform and their skills.

But if you hear a complaint that’s new, you should stop the talk right away and tell the person complaining that you don’t agree with what they’re saying. You don’t want to hurt the other person’s chances before you check how well they’re actually doing. You don’t want the complaint to become true just because people believe it.

After stopping the conversation, quickly check how the employee is really doing. If they’re doing a great job, find out why the person complained and fix that problem. Don’t let this kind of serious accusation just sit there and cause trouble. If the employee is doing a bad job, then later you can ask the complaining person for more details, but you should start planning to let the poor worker go.

As the CEO, you need to think about how your words and actions affect the whole company. It might feel good to seem open and ready to act, but be careful not to encourage bad behavior.
