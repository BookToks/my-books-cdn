Making a company successful takes more than just claiming credit for deals. Usually, the people who say they made the biggest deals happen can’t explain how they actually did it. When I checked with others who worked on those deals, they told a very different story.

When I talked to Mark Cranney, it was hard to get him to brag about what he did. Some other interviewers even thought he was a bit rude because he didn’t like certain questions. One interviewer said, “Ben, I know he grew the Nike deal from one million to five million because our contact at Nike told me, but Mark wouldn’t explain how.” When I interviewed Mark, he mostly wanted to talk about how his old company won deals.

He explained in detail how his team found weaknesses in their competitors and how he worked with another leader to improve the product.

He also talked about how he helped the CEO change how the sales team was trained and organized.

When we talked about Opsware, Mark already knew a lot. He had talked to salespeople at our biggest competitor and knew what deals they had. He kept asking me how we planned to win those deals and get new ones. He wanted to know everyone’s strengths and weaknesses on our team and what our plan was to win. He didn’t ask about his pay or promotion until the very end, and then only wanted to make sure his pay was based on performance, not office politics. It was clear Mark cared about the team and making it successful.

While Mark was in charge, sales grew more than ten times, and the company’s value grew twenty times. More importantly, fewer people left the sales team, customers were treated fairly, and the legal and finance teams said Mark always protected the company first.

FINAL THOUGHT: It might work if some employees focus only on their own careers, but expecting senior managers to do the right things just for the wrong reasons is risky.
