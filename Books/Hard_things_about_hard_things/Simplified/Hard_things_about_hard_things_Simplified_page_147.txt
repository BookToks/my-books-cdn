Having experience in a specific area is really important.

For example, if you’re a technical founder, you might not be great at building a worldwide sales team, creating a super strong brand, or making big business deals that can change everything. Getting a top expert in these areas can help your company grow much faster.

One way to decide if you should hire someone from outside or promote someone inside is to think about whether inside knowledge or outside knowledge matters more for the job. For example, for engineering managers, knowing the company’s code and team is usually more important than knowing how to run big engineering groups. So, people inside the company might be better for this role.

But if you’re hiring someone to sell your product to big companies, it’s the opposite. It’s way more important they understand how your customers think, what they like, and how to find the right salespeople in different places. This matters more than knowing your own company well.

That’s why when the head of engineering gets promoted from inside, they usually do well. But when the head of sales is promoted from inside, they often don’t do well. Asking yourself, “Do I need someone who knows our company or someone who knows the outside world better?” will help you pick the right person.

BRINGING SENIOR PEOPLE ON BOARD

Hiring senior people can be tricky, as I talked about in the sections “Why It’s Hard to Bring Big Company Execs into Little Companies” and “Hiring Executives: If You’ve Never Done the Job, How Do You Hire Somebody Good?” (see pages 119 and 124).

It’s also hard to manage them well once they join.

Senior people bring some challenges: They have their own way of doing things. They bring the habits, communication style, and values from their old company. These might not fit perfectly with your company.

They also know how to work the system. Because they come from bigger companies, they usually know how to navigate office politics and processes.
