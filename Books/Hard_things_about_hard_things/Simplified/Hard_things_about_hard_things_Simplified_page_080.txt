NOBODY CARES

“Just win, baby.” —AL DAVIS

Back when things were really tough at Loudcloud, I often wondered: How could I have prepared for this? How could I have known that half our customers would go out of business? How could I have guessed it would be so hard to get money from investors? How could I have predicted that there would be 221 IPOs in 2000 and only 19 in 2001? Could anyone expect me to do well with all that going on?

While feeling sorry for myself, I happened to watch an interview with famous football coach Bill Parcells. He talked about a similar problem he faced when he started as a head coach. In his first season, Parcells’s team, the New York Giants, had a lot of injured players. He worried a lot about how these injuries would hurt the team because it’s hard to win even with your best players, let alone with substitutes.

When his friend and mentor, Raiders owner Al Davis, called to check on him, Parcells explained his injury problems.

Parcells said, “Al, I don’t know how we can win without so many of our best players. What should I do?” Davis replied, “Bill, nobody cares, just coach your team.” That might be the best advice a CEO can get. Because, really, nobody cares.

When things go wrong in your company, nobody cares. The media don’t care, your investors don’t care, your board doesn’t care, your employees don’t care, and even your mom doesn’t care.

Nobody cares.

And they’re right not to care. A good excuse for failing won’t save your investors’ money, won’t keep any employees’ jobs, or get you new customers. It also won’t make you feel better when you have to shut down your company and declare bankruptcy.
