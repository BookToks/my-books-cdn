MANAGEMENT DEBT

Thanks to Ward Cunningham, the programmer who made the first wiki, the idea of “technical debt” is easy to understand now. Sometimes you can save time by writing quick and messy code, but later you have to fix it—and it often takes more work than you expected. This trade-off can be okay sometimes, but you have to remember it or it will cause big problems.

There is a similar idea called management debt, which people don’t talk about as much.

Like technical debt, management debt happens when you make a quick management choice that causes big problems later. Sometimes this trade-off is okay, but often it is not. If you ignore management debt, you could end up with a broken management system.

Management debt can show up in many ways, but here are three common examples in startups: 1. Putting two people in one job 2. Paying too much to keep a key employee 3. Not giving employees feedback or managing their performance.

PUTTING TWO IN THE BOX

What do you do when you have two great employees who both should have the same job? Maybe you have a top architect running engineering, but she can’t grow the team well. You also have a great operations person who isn’t very technical. You want to keep both, but only have one job for them. So you decide to put “two in the box,” which means sharing one position and taking on some management debt. The short-term benefit is clear: you keep both employees and don’t have to train either because they will, in theory, work together.
