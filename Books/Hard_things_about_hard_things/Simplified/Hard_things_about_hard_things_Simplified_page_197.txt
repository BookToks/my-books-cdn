Will the employees feel excited or sad about this promotion?

Great CEOs always find smart ways to gather important information. They look for clues in everything they do, like staff meetings, customer talks, or one-on-one chats. The best plans come from knowing a lot about everyone they work with—employees, customers, partners, or investors.

2. CAN THE CEO MAKE THE COMPANY DO WHAT SHE KNOWS?

If the CEO shares a clear and exciting vision and makes quick, good decisions, can she get the company to follow her plan? The first step is strong leadership, like I talked about in “Follow the Leader.” Also, doing things well needs many skills. Bigger companies need even more skills.

For a company to carry out many decisions and projects, it needs to have the ability to do so. That means the company must have the right people with the right talents in the right jobs.

It also needs to be a place where every employee can get things done. Employees should feel motivated, communication should be good, everyone should know a lot, and the goals should be clear.

Is the CEO building an awesome team?

The CEO is in charge of the top leaders and how the company hires everyone else. She needs to make sure the company finds the best people and picks those with the right talents and skills. Making sure the team is great is a big part of running the company. Great CEOs always check if they’re building the best team.

How good the team is depends on what the company needs at that time and the problems it faces. So, sometimes the top team changes a lot, but it still stays strong.
