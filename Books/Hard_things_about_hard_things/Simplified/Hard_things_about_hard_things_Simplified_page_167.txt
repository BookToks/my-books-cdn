THE MOST DIFFICULT CEO SKILL

The hardest skill I learned as a CEO was managing my own mind. Things like organizing the company, setting up processes, tracking progress, hiring, and firing were easier compared to keeping my thoughts and emotions under control. I thought I was strong before I started, but I wasn’t. I was actually pretty soft.

Over the years, I’ve talked to hundreds of CEOs, and they all say the same thing. But hardly anyone talks about it, and I’ve never read anything about it. It’s kind of like a secret rule: The first rule about a CEO’s mental struggles is not to talk about them.

Even though it’s risky to break this rule, I want to explain what this feeling is like and share some tips that helped me. In the end, this is the most personal and important challenge any CEO will face.

IF I’M DOING A GOOD JOB, WHY DO I FEEL SO BAD?

Usually, someone becomes a CEO because they really care about their work and have a strong purpose. Also, a CEO needs to be skilled or smart enough for people to want to work with them.

No one wants to be a bad CEO, run a messy company, or create a huge, slow-moving bureaucracy. But no CEO ever has an easy path to building a great company. Many things go wrong along the way, and most could have been avoided.

The first problem is that you only learn to be a CEO by being a CEO. No training or previous job really prepares you to run a whole company. The only way to learn is by doing it. This means you’ll face lots of challenges you don’t know how to handle and need skills you don’t have. Still, everyone expects you to know what you’re doing because, well, you are the CEO. I remember when I first became CEO, an investor asked me for the “cap table.” I had a rough idea of what he meant but didn’t know the exact format or what to include or leave out. It was tough at first.
