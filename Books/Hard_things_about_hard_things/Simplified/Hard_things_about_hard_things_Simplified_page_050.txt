Even though that might have been true, changing the design of our product could make us lose our strong position in the market. I struggled with this decision for weeks before realizing that things were moving so fast we had to make big changes to our product to stay on top.

The main question was about the team. Were they ready for another huge challenge, or were they too tired after a long journey? I decided to ask my closest team members what they thought. Everyone, except one person who believed there was still a big chance to grow, wanted to sell. So, now it was just about figuring out the price.

But what price?

After talking a lot with John O’Farrell, I decided we should sell the company for $14 per share, which is about $1.6 billion. I told the board. They thought the price was very high and doubted anyone would offer that much, but they still supported me. I called all the potential buyers and told them we would only accept bids of $14 or more. Nobody agreed.

More than a month went by without any news, so I thought the talks were over. I started focusing again on how to change our product to stay competitive. Then, I got a call from Bob Beauchamp, the CEO of BMC Software. He offered $13.25 per share. I stood firm and said, “Bob, that’s good, but we want $14 per share.” Bob said he needed to think about it.

Two days later, he called back and offered $14 per share. Wow. It felt like we had finally caught something big.

John and I quickly told the other buyers that we had an offer we planned to accept. Hewlett-Packard was still interested and offered $13.50 per share to see if I was serious. I said that as a public company CEO, I couldn’t accept less. HP then offered $14.25 per share, or $1.65 billion in cash. We had a deal.

When it was all over—the long journey from Loudcloud to Opsware—I couldn’t believe I had sold something that took me eight years and all my energy to build.

How did I do it? I was really sick. I couldn’t sleep, I was sweating, I threw up, and I cried. Then I realized it was the smartest thing I’d ever done in my career. We built something from nothing, lost it, and then rebuilt it into a $1.65 billion company.

At that point, it felt like my business life was kind of done. I had hired the best people I could find and had gone through everything from starting the company to selling it. I definitely didn’t feel like doing all that again.
