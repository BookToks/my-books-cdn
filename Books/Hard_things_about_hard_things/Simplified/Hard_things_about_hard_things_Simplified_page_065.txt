GETTING READY TO FIRE AN EXECUTIVE

When you hire an executive, you make the job sound amazing. You explain in detail how great it will be for her to join your company, and how much better it is than working somewhere else. But then, one day, you realize you have to fire her. That can be hard to accept, Ms. CEO.

Actually, firing an executive can be easier than firing other employees. Executives have been in that situation before and usually act very professional. But firing an executive the right way is more complicated and really important. If you don’t learn how to do it properly, you might have to do it again soon.

Like with many things, the key to firing an executive well is being prepared.

Here’s a four-step process that will be fair to the executive and help your company.

STEP 1: FIND THE REAL REASON

Sometimes you fire an executive because of bad behavior, not doing their job, or laziness, but this doesn’t happen often. Usually, if you hired the right way, those won’t be the reasons. At this level, companies check carefully for the right skills, motivation, and past success. So, if you have to fire your head of marketing, it’s probably not because he’s bad; it might be because you made mistakes.

This means you shouldn’t think about firing an executive as their failure. Instead, see it as a failure in your hiring or how you brought them into the company. So, the first step to firing an executive the right way is figuring out why you hired the wrong person.

You might have made mistakes like not clearly defining the job. If you don’t know exactly what you want, you probably won’t get it. Often, CEOs hire executives based on a vague idea of what they think and feel.
