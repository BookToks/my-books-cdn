Jackie was always late, so I wasn’t worried. But after two hours, Claude called to ask what was going on. I was shocked as I looked at the cold fancy dinner we had made. My date, Felicia, said she was “too tired” to come. Wow, that was so rude!

I told Claude to give me the phone. I said, “Hi, this is Ben, your blind date.” Felicia said, “Sorry, I’m tired and it’s late.” I replied, “It’s late because you’re late.” She said, “I know, but I just can’t come.” Then I tried to make her understand.

I said, “I get that you’re tired, but you should have told me before we spent all day cooking. Now, if you don’t come right away, it will seem really disrespectful.” If she was selfish like she seemed, my words wouldn’t matter, and I’d be better off without the date. But if she cared, maybe there was still a chance.

Felicia said, “Okay, I’ll come.” Ninety minutes later, she showed up wearing white shorts and looked really pretty. I had totally forgotten about the fight I had the day before. During a basketball game, a tall guy in camouflage pants threw the ball at my brother Jonathan. Jonathan was a musician with long hair and pretty small. I was used to football and fighting, so I jumped in and fought the guy. I got some good hits but also got punched under my eye, leaving a mark. Maybe the guy just got mad about a foul, but I will never know.

When I opened the door, Felicia’s amazing green eyes saw the bruise right away. Years later, she told me her first thought was, “This guy looks like a thug. Coming here was a mistake.” Luckily, we didn’t trust our first thoughts. We’ve been happily married for almost twenty-five years with three great kids.
