Choices like these give you serious headaches. Here’s a tip for future business owners: If you hate choosing between bad and worse, don’t become a CEO.

Jason asked some of the smartest people in the business for advice, but in the end, he had to make the decision alone. No one had the perfect answer, and whatever he chose, Jason would have to deal with the results. So far, his choice to lay off mostly the newest employees worked out. Ning’s money is up and the team feels good. If things had gone badly, it would have been Jason’s fault, and he’d have to figure out a new plan. When I see Jason, I like to say, “Welcome to the show.” Later, Jason sold Ning to Glam and became CEO of Lytro.

At times like this, it’s important to know that almost every company faces moments where it feels like everything is about to fail. My partner Scott Weiss at Andreessen Horowitz told me this happens so often it has a name: WFIO, which means “We’re Fucked, It’s Over” (said like “whiff-ee-yo”). Every company goes through two to five of these moments, and I’m pretty sure I went through at least a dozen at Opsware. These moments feel way worse than they actually are—especially if you’re the CEO.

WAYS TO CALM YOUR NERVES The thing about feelings is that everyone is different. Still, I’ve learned a few tricks over time to help myself, and I hope they help you too.

Make some friends. Even though it’s really hard to get great advice on tough decisions, it helps a lot just to talk with people who have faced similar hard choices.

Write it down. When I had to tell my board that we should sell all our customers and revenue because we were a public company and needed to change, it stressed me out. Writing down all my reasons helped me separate my feelings from the facts and make the decision faster.

Focus on the road, not the wall. When you learn to drive a race car, one of the first things they teach you is to look where you want to go, not at the wall you want to avoid.
