STAYING GREAT

As a CEO, you know you can’t build an amazing company without having an amazing team. But how do you tell if an executive is really top-notch? And if she was great when you hired her, will she stay great? If she stops being great, can she get back to being great?

These are tough questions, and they get even trickier during the hiring process. Every CEO wants to hire the absolute best person and tries hard to get them. When that person says yes, the CEO feels like they just won the jackpot. If I had a tattoo for every time a CEO said they’d just hired “the best VP in the industry,” I’d look like Lil Wayne.

So, we start off thinking that the person we hired must be amazing, even before they’ve done any work. But here’s the problem: even great executives can get worse over time. If you watch sports, you know that great athletes don’t stay great forever. One day they’re stars, and the next day they’re not. Executives don’t age as fast as athletes, but companies, markets, and technology change way faster than football does. So, an executive who is awesome at a small startup this year might not be so awesome next year when the company is bigger and making a lot more money.

THE STANDARD

First, remember that just because someone interviewed well and got good references doesn’t mean they’ll do a great job in your company. There are two types of work cultures: ones where what you do is important, and ones where who you are is all that matters. You want to be in the first kind, or else you’ll fail.

You have to expect a lot from your people, but what should those expectations be? I talked about this in the “Old People” section. Also, keep these ideas in mind.
