Managing only by numbers is like painting by numbers. Some things you want to encourage can be counted, but some cannot.

If you only focus on goals you can measure and ignore the ones you can’t, you won’t reach the important goals that don’t have numbers. Managing only by numbers is like a beginner’s way to paint—it’s not the best way.

At HP, the company wanted to make a lot of money now and in the future. But by only looking at the numbers, HP made money now by hurting their future.

There were many numbers and other important goals that could have helped, like: Was HP winning more or less against competitors? Was customer happiness going up or down? What did engineers think about the products?

By treating the company like a black box, some parts of HP focused only on the present and hurt their ability to compete later.

The company gave rewards to managers who met short-term goals, even if it was bad for the company later. It would have been better to think about the “white box,” which looks beyond numbers and checks how the company got those numbers. It punishes managers who hurt the future for short-term gains and rewards those who invest in the future, even if it’s hard to measure.

Here’s a final thought: Leaders can easily be misunderstood. To do things right, you must know that whatever you measure will change how employees act. After you decide what result you want, think about how your goal will affect employee behavior. If you don’t, the side effects might be worse than the problem you wanted to fix.
