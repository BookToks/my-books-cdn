I want to thank all the partners and employees at Andreessen Horowitz who put up with my bad moods and swear words while I wrote this. I couldn’t have done it without you. Thanks for helping make the dream of a firm for founding CEOs real.

A special thanks to Margit Wennmachers for believing I had something important to say and helping me find people who would listen. I feel lucky to work with someone so amazing.

Grace Ellis has been with me through the whole process, taking care of every weird little detail. She never once complained. She also gave me great advice and has been a true friend.

Thank you, Ken Coleman, for giving me my first job and being a great mentor for almost thirty years.

Thanks to my brother-in-law, Cartheu Jordan Jr., for being a big part of this book and my life. He’s like Branch Rickey to my Jackie Robinson.

Thank you, John and Loretta Wiley, for always supporting me in everything I do.

Thanks to my brothers and sisters, Jonathan Daniel, Anne Rishon, and Sarah Horowitz, for shaping who I am. Love you always, Sarah.

I thank the late, great Mike Homer for his wisdom, help, and love. I thank Andy Rachleff for being a great friend and gentleman. Thank you, Sy Lorne, for keeping me out of trouble. Thank you, Mike Volpi, for being part of the board of a pretty scary company.

Finally, thank you, Boochie, Red, and Boogie, for being the best kids I could ever imagine.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
