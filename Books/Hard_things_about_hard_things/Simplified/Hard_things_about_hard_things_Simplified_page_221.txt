Back then, companies were mostly just groups of talent agents working separately. Each agent had their own connections and worked only for their own clients. For example, one agent might introduce an actor like Dustin Hoffman to a big studio, but only that agent controlled those relationships. Other agents at the same firm didn’t get automatic access to those connections. This was kind of like how traditional venture capital firms worked, where each investor managed their own contacts and investments.

Ovitz had a new idea: to create a connected network where any agent could use the whole firm's resources to help their clients. This would make the firm way stronger than any single agent at other agencies. To make this happen, Ovitz and his partners agreed to not take salaries for a few years and reinvest their earnings into building what he called “The Franchise.” This included specialists in different areas like book publishing, music, and international markets. His plan worked — in fifteen years, CAA represented 90% of the top Hollywood talent and changed the game, giving artists more control and money.

We decided to copy CAA’s model almost exactly. At Andreessen Horowitz, employees even have the same job title as those at CAA: partner. Michael thought it was a cool idea, but no one else really agreed.

Most people said stuff like, “This is Silicon Valley, not Hollywood. You don’t get the business here.” But with Michael’s support, we went ahead anyway. When applying this idea to venture capital, we built networks in these areas:

Large companies — Every new startup needs to sell to or work with bigger companies.

Executives — If you succeed, you’ll need to hire top managers.

Engineers — In tech, you can never have too many great engineers.

Press and analysts — We have a saying: Show it and sell it; hide it and keep it.
