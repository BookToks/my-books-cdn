WHY IT’S HARD TO BRING BIG COMPANY EXECS INTO LITTLE COMPANIES

So, you’ve made a product that people like and now you’re ready to grow your company. The board tells you to hire experienced executives who know about money, sales, and marketing to help turn your great product into a great business. You find some candidates you like, but the venture capitalist (VC) on the board says, “You can do better. This company will be huge, so we need top talent.” So, you aim high and hire a super-successful head of sales.

This guy has managed huge teams with thousands of people. He has great references and even looks the part. Your VC loves him because his résumé is awesome.

SIX MONTHS LATER . . .

Six months pass and everyone wonders why this sales guy, who hasn’t done much, got such a big stock option deal. Meanwhile, the people actually working hard have way fewer options. Worse, the company is struggling because you’re missing your goals while your expensive executive isn’t delivering. What just happened?

The main thing to understand is that being an executive in a big company is very different from being one in a small company. When I managed thousands of people at Hewlett-Packard after buying Opsware, my time was always taken up by tons of requests. Small companies wanted to partner or sell to us, people in my team needed approvals, other departments needed help, customers wanted my attention, and more. So, I spent most of my time fixing and improving what already existed. Most of my work was “reacting” to things coming at me. In fact, most big company executives will tell you that having more than three new projects in a quarter is too much. Because of this, big company executives get used to constant interruptions.
