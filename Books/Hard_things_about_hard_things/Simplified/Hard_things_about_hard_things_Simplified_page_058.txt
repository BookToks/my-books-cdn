CEOS SHOULD TELL IT LIKE IT IS

One of the most important lessons I learned as a founder and CEO was surprising. The biggest change I made was when I stopped always being too positive.

When I was a young CEO, I felt a lot of pressure. My employees depended on me, I didn’t always know what to do, and I was responsible for millions of dollars. Because of this, I took failures really hard. If we lost a customer, missed a deadline, or shipped a product that wasn’t perfect, it bothered me a lot. I thought if I shared these problems with my team, it would make things worse. So, I tried to stay positive and keep everyone motivated. But I was totally wrong.

I realized my mistake during a talk with my brother-in-law, Cartheu. He worked as a telephone lineman at AT&T, climbing poles and fixing lines. I had just met a senior executive at AT&T, “Fred,” and asked Cartheu if he knew him. Cartheu said, “Yeah, Fred comes by about once every three months just to blow a little sunshine up my ass.” Right then, I understood that being too positive was actually hurting my company.

I thought I was helping by focusing on the good stuff and ignoring the bad. But my team knew things weren’t as great as I said. They saw the real problems, but still had to hear me pretending everything was perfect at meetings.

Why did I make this mistake, and why was it so bad?

THE POSITIVITY DELUSION

As the top person in the company, I thought I could handle bad news best. But the truth was the opposite: I took bad news the hardest. Engineers could easily move on from problems that kept me up all night.
