HIRING EXECUTIVES: IF YOU’VE NEVER DONE THE JOB, HOW DO YOU HIRE SOMEBODY GOOD?

The biggest difference between being a great manager in one area and being a great general manager—or a CEO—is that as a general manager, you have to hire and manage people who are way better at their jobs than you are. Sometimes, you even have to hire people for jobs you’ve never done yourself. How many CEOs have been in charge of HR, engineering, sales, marketing, finance, and legal all at once? Probably none.

So, if you have no experience, how do you hire someone good?

STEP 1: KNOW WHAT YOU WANT Step 1 is the most important step, but it’s also the one people skip the most. Tony Robbins, a famous self-help coach, says, “If you don’t know what you want, the chances that you’ll get it are extremely low.” But if you’ve never done the job, how do you know what to want?

First, you need to admit that you don’t know much and avoid trying to learn everything just by interviewing candidates. Interviews can teach you a lot, but if that’s your only way to learn, it’s risky.

If you only rely on interviews, you might fall into some traps: Hiring based on how someone looks or sounds in an interview. It sounds silly, but many executive hires happen this way. When a CEO doesn’t really know what they want, and the board of directors hasn’t thought much about the hire, this is often what happens.

Looking for someone who seems like they fit a perfect mold. If I had done this, I would never have hired Mark Cranney, and you probably wouldn’t be reading this now. This way of thinking is totally wrong.
