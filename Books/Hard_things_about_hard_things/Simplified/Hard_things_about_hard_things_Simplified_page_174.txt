Organizing a company the right way is really important. But when the founders don’t have the courage to decide who is in charge, every worker has to deal with the hassle of getting approval from two people.

Decisions get even scarier as the company grows. When we decided to make Loudcloud a public company with only $2 million in revenue, it wasn’t a hard choice logically — the other option was going bankrupt. But it was still really scary because most employees, the press, and many investors thought it was crazy.

Sometimes making the right choice needs both smarts and courage. CEOs have different information and views than anyone else in the company. Often, some employees and board members are smarter and more experienced than the CEO. The only reason the CEO can decide better is because she knows more.

It gets even harder when the CEO isn’t sure which choice is better — maybe she thinks 54% to kill a product, but 46% to keep it. If the really smart people on the board and staff disagree, her courage is put to the test.

How can she kill the product when she isn’t even sure she’s right and everyone’s against her? If she’s wrong, she ignored advice from her best advisers. If she’s right, will people even notice?

To make things more complicated, most of the management team and the board thought he should sell. They were way more experienced than Hamlet. Because of this, Hamlet had many sleepless nights wondering if he was right. He realized he couldn’t really know for sure. This didn’t help him sleep. In the end, Hamlet…
