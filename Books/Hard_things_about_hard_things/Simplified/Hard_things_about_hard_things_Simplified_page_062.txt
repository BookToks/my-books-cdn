I got an email from some employees talking to each other. One smart employee said, “Ben is either lying or stupid or both.” When I read that, I thought, “definitely stupid.” It’s hard to think about the future when the past is so overwhelming—but that’s exactly what you need to do.

STEP 2: DON’T WAIT  
Once you decide you have to lay people off, don’t wait too long to do it.

If news leaks out (and it will if you wait), you will have more problems. Employees will ask managers if layoffs are coming. If managers don’t know, they’ll look bad. If managers do know, they might have to lie, cause more leaks, or stay quiet, which will make people more upset. At Loudcloud/Opsware, we messed this up the first time but did better the next two times.

STEP 3: BE SURE WHY YOU’RE LAYING PEOPLE OFF  
Before a layoff, board members might try to make it sound positive. They might say, “This is a good chance to fix performance issues and make the company simpler.” That might be true, but don’t let it confuse your message. You are laying people off because the company didn’t meet its goals. If it was just about performance, you’d handle it differently. The company failed. This is important because the message needs to be clear. Don’t say, “This is great, we’re fixing performance.” Say, “The company failed, and to move forward, we have to let some great people go.” Saying the truth might seem small, but it’s really important. CEOs say “Trust me” to their employees all the time. Trust me: This company will do well. Trust me: This will help your career. Trust me: This will be good for your life. A layoff breaks that trust. To build trust again, you have to be honest.

STEP 4: TRAIN YOUR MANAGERS
