I found the first chapter of Andy Grove’s book, High Output Management, called "The Basics of Production," really helpful. For new companies, here are some important things to remember: Focus on what you want to produce first. For example, in hiring, the goal is to find an amazing employee. If that’s the goal, what steps will help you get there?

Figure out how you’ll know if each step is working. Are you getting enough people applying? Are they the right people?

Will your interview process pick the best person for the job? After you choose someone, will they say yes to the job? Once they start working, will they do a good job? After that, will they stay with the company? How will you check each of these steps?

Make sure you build responsibility into the system. Which team or person is in charge of each step? What can you do to make their work more visible?

Final thought: Growing a company is a lot like growing a product.

Different company sizes need different setups. If you plan for growth too early, your company might feel slow and heavy. If you wait too long, your company could break under pressure. Watch how fast your company is really growing as you add new parts. It’s good to get ready for growth, but don’t prepare too much too soon.
