The most important part of this whole process is training the management team.

If you send managers into this really uncomfortable situation without any training, most of them will mess up.

Training starts with a golden rule: Managers have to lay off their own people.

They can’t just give the job to HR or a meaner manager. You can’t hire an outside company like in the movie Up in the Air. Every manager must lay off their own employees.

Why is it so strict? Why can’t the tougher managers do it for everyone? Because people might forget most days at your company, but they will never forget the day they got laid off. They will remember every little detail, and those details matter a lot.

The company’s and managers’ reputations depend on facing the employees who trusted you and worked hard for you. If you hired me and I worked hard, I expect you to have the courage to lay me off yourself.

Once you make it clear that managers have to lay off their own people, make sure to prepare them for it: 1. They should explain briefly what happened and that it’s about the company, not the person.

2. They should make it clear that the layoff is real and can’t be changed.

3. They must know all the details about benefits and support the company will offer.

STEP 5: TALK TO THE WHOLE COMPANY Before doing the layoffs, the CEO must speak to everyone. The CEO should give a message that explains the situation and supports the managers. If the CEO does this right, it makes the managers’ jobs easier.

Remember what former Intuit CEO Bill Campbell told me—The message is mainly for the people who stay. Those who stay care a lot about how you treat the people who are leaving. Many of the people laid off are closer to the people who stay than you are, so treat them with respect.

Still, the company needs to keep moving forward, so don’t apologize too much.
