She had to threaten to quit just to get a fair raise. On top of that, he was really mad because you gave her too much money. So, he told a few friends about it but didn’t say her name to keep it a secret. Now, everyone in engineering knows that the best way to get a raise is to get an offer from another company and then threaten to quit. It’s going to take a long time to fix that problem.

Your company now has twenty-five people, and you know you should set up a system to manage performance, but you don’t want to deal with the hassle. You worry it will make the company feel too big. Plus, you don’t want to upset your workers because you can’t afford to lose anyone right now. Everyone is happy, so why cause trouble? Why not just ignore the problem for now?

The first real problem will happen when someone isn’t doing their job well: CEO says, “He was good when we hired him; what happened?” Manager says, “He’s not doing what we need.” CEO asks, “Did we tell him clearly?” Manager says, “Maybe not clearly…” The bigger problem is that without feedback, the company won’t work well. Everyone needs to know what’s expected and how to improve. If people don’t get feedback, they won’t know what to fix. Without it, the company will end up performing badly.

In the end, the best CEOs I know choose the tough option. If they have to give everyone the same bonus to keep it easy or reward people based on performance and make some people upset, they choose to upset some people. If they have to cut a popular project because it doesn’t fit long-term plans or keep it just to make people happy, they choose what’s best for the future.
