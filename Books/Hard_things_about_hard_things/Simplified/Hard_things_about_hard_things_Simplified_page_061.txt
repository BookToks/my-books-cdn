THE RIGHT WAY TO LAY PEOPLE OFF

Right after we sold Opsware to Hewlett-Packard, I talked with Doug Leone, a famous venture capitalist from Sequoia Capital. He wanted me to tell the story of how we went from almost failing to making $1.6 billion without needing more money from investors.

I told him all the details—including almost going bankrupt several times, our stock price dropping to 35 cents per share, getting a lot of bad press, and having three layoffs where we lost 400 employees total. He was most surprised by the layoffs. In his 20 years in venture capital, he’d never seen a company bounce back from so many layoffs and still make over a billion dollars. He said he’d always bet against that happening.

Since my experience was different, I asked him why other startups failed after layoffs. He said layoffs usually ruin a company’s culture. When employees see their friends get fired, they stop wanting to work hard and sacrifice for the company. He said surviving one layoff is possible, but doing great after three big layoffs and bad press is almost impossible. He wanted to know how we managed it. After thinking, here’s what I believe.
