I worked up the courage to tell management how messed up their situation was. Management denied there was a problem, then defended the way things were, and finally ignored the problem. Steve said, “Okay.” I asked, “Did you know your manager Tim hasn’t met with any of his employees in the last six months?” Steve said, “No.” I said, “Now that you know, do you realize there’s no way for him to know if his team is doing well or not?” Steve said, “Yes.” I told him, “In short, you and Tim are stopping me from reaching my one and only goal. You’re blocking me from doing what’s most important. So if Tim doesn’t meet with every employee in the next 24 hours, I will have to fire him and you. Clear?” Steve said, “Crystal.” Was that really necessary?

You might say that no matter how well a company is managed, it will fail if the product doesn’t fit the market. You might also say that badly managed companies can still do great if their product fits the market. Both points are true. So was it really needed for me to give such a serious speech and threaten one of my top people?

I think it was, for three reasons: Being a good company doesn’t matter much when things are going well, but it can be the difference between success and failure when things go wrong.

Things always go wrong.

Being a good company is important on its own.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCCESS AND FAILURE When things go well, there are many reasons to stay at a company: Your career can grow because as the company expands, lots of cool jobs naturally open up.
