At Facebook, only Directors or Managers can approve title changes.

Why does this happen? First, it makes sure every new worker is given the right level when they join. This stops new people from getting higher titles than the employees who have been working hard for a long time. This helps keep everyone happy and feels fair. Second, it makes all the managers learn and understand Facebook’s system for ranking jobs, which helps a lot when promoting and paying people.

He also wants job titles to mean something and show who really has power in the company. When a company grows fast, it’s important to keep things clear. This is harder if there are too many people with big titles like VP or Chief.

He also noticed that business people often have bigger titles than engineers. Even though big titles help them get meetings outside the company, he wants the engineers and product people to be the heart of Facebook’s culture, so he tries to keep titles balanced.

Does Facebook ever miss out on hiring someone because their titles are low? Yes, for sure. But maybe they don’t want those people anyway. Facebook’s hiring process is designed to attract the right kind of people and to discourage the wrong ones.

So, which way is better, Andreessen’s or Zuckerberg’s? It depends. Facebook has so many strengths in hiring that being strict about titles doesn’t stop them from getting top talent. Your company might not be the same, so using big titles might help. In both cases, you should have a clear and fair system for leveling and promotions.

FINAL THOUGHT You might think spending a lot of time on titles and promotions is silly. Actually, it’s very important. If you don’t have a good system, employees will get upset about unfairness. But if you do it right, no one will care much about titles except for fun things like Employee of the Month.
