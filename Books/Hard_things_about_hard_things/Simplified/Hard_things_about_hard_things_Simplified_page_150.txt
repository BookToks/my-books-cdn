ONE-ON-ONE

After I first wrote about one-on-ones, a lot of people shared their thoughts with me. About half said one-on-ones are useless and that I shouldn’t make such a big deal out of them. The other half wanted to know how to make one-on-ones better. I think both groups are actually talking about the same thing but from different angles.

Maybe the most important job for a CEO is setting up how people in the company talk to each other. This includes how the company is organized, meetings, emails, chat apps, and even one-on-one meetings between managers and employees. Without good communication, ideas and information get stuck, and the company becomes a bad place to work. While it’s possible to have good communication without one-on-ones, usually they help a lot by letting ideas and info flow up from employees to managers.

Most people who don’t like one-on-one meetings have probably had bad experiences with them. The trick to a good one-on-one is understanding that it’s the employee’s meeting, not the manager’s. It’s a time for the employee to talk about important stuff, cool ideas, or problems that don’t fit in status reports or emails.

If you’re an employee, how do you get feedback on a half-formed idea without sounding dumb? How do you say a coworker is making it hard to get work done without blaming them?

How do you get help when you love your job but your personal life is falling apart? You probably can’t do that in a status report, email, or chat app. For these kinds of talks, one-on-ones are really important.

If you like having a plan for meetings, then the employee should make the agenda. A good idea is for the employee to send the agenda ahead of time. This lets them cancel the meeting if there’s nothing important and shows that the meeting is theirs and can last as long as they need.
