Maybe Cathy thinks you’re leaving because you don’t like her or her company, but she probably won’t see it that way.

People usually leave companies when things aren’t going well, so you should assume Cathy is trying hard to save her company. Losing a great employee hurts her a lot because it makes other workers think the company is failing.

Even worse, Cathy’s employees might see you leaving as a betrayal—like you, her friend, are stealing her workers.

They might think, “Cathy is such a bad boss that even her friends are hiring her employees.” So what started as a simple issue becomes very emotional.

You don’t want to lose Cathy as a friend, so you tell her that Mitchell is the only one who came to you and that he’s the first and last employee from her company to join yours. Usually, she will understand and appreciate that. She’ll forgive you, but she won’t forget.

Remembering Mitchell is important because he’s just the beginning of problems between you and Cathy. Since he’s a great worker, other good employees will probably ask him why he left and where he’s going. He’ll give good reasons, and soon they might want to leave and join your company too. By the time you realize what’s happening, you might have already made promises to these employees or even sent them job offers.

Your employees will tell you that Cathy’s people came to them first and that they had other job offers too, so they were going to leave anyway. But Cathy’s managers will tell a different story. They’ll beg her to stop you from stealing their workers or they won’t be able to do their jobs. This will make Cathy upset and angry. In the end, social pressure is stronger than any good argument you can make.

Here’s an easy way to understand this. If your boyfriend left you, would you want your best friend to date him? It might seem logical he’ll date someone anyway, so why not your friend? But this situation isn’t logical, and you just lost one friend.
