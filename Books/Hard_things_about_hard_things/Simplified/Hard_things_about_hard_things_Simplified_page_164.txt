— CHAPTER 7 — HOW TO LEAD EVEN WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING

“This is for every tough neighborhood out there. Nas the Don, Super Cat the Don Dada, understood.” —NAS, “THE DON”

After selling the Loudcloud business to EDS, we quickly faced a big problem. Our investors couldn’t understand how selling all our money-making parts could leave anything good for them to invest in. Because of this, big investors sold all their Opsware shares, and our stock price dropped to just $0.35 per share. This price was important because it meant the company was worth only half the cash we had in the bank.

This showed that investors thought Opsware had no value, and they expected us to waste half our money before realizing the best thing to do was give the cash back to them. To make things worse, I got a warning from NASDAQ saying if our stock price didn’t go above $1 in the next ninety days, they would remove us from the main market, and we’d be stuck trading as a penny stock.

I told the board this bad news and gave them three choices:  
1. Do a reverse split. We could combine ten shares into one, making the stock price ten times higher but having fewer shares.  
2. Give up and become a penny stock.  
3. Try hard to get more people to buy our stock so the price would go up three times.

The board was very understanding and open to all the ideas. Andy
