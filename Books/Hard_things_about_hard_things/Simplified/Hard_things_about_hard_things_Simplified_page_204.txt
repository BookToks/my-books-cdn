A software engineer finds a big problem in your product’s design that will make it hard to grow later. She says the product launch will need to be pushed back by three months to fix it. Everyone agrees that three months is okay. But the delay actually ends up being nine months. She was right about the problem though. So, do you praise her for being smart and brave, or blame her for the delay?

If you act like a strict lawyer and blame her for not keeping her promise, you’ll probably stop her and others from taking risks next time. If you always do this, don’t be surprised if your team stops working on tough problems because they’ll be too busy protecting themselves.

But if you don’t hold her responsible at all, the people who worked hard to meet their deadlines might feel stupid. They might think, “Why did I stay up all night to finish on time if the boss rewards someone who’s six months late?” If your hardest workers feel this way, look at yourself. You didn’t hold people accountable for what they did.

This is called the Accountability vs. Creativity Paradox.

To fix it, start with a simple question: Do you think your employees are mostly creative, smart, and motivated? Or do you think they are lazy, sneaky, and just waiting to leave work? If you think the second, you won’t get creativity or new ideas. It’s better to believe people mean well unless they show otherwise. But you still need to hold them accountable so others don’t feel like fools. What do you think about that?

Let’s check accountability by looking at promises, results, and effort.
