Andy Grove, a great CEO during tough times, explains how companies switch from “peacetime” to “wartime” in his book Only the Paranoid Survive.

A peacetime mission is like Google trying to make the Internet faster.

Google is so big in search that making the Internet faster helps them because people can do more searches. Since they are the top company, they focus on growing the market instead of fighting their competitors. On the other hand, a wartime mission was when Andy Grove had to get Intel out of the memory business in the 1980s because Japanese companies were a huge threat. This threat was so serious it could have ruined Intel, so they had to leave their main business that employed 80% of their workers.

I learned that peacetime and wartime need very different ways of managing people. Most management books talk about peacetime leadership but not much about wartime. For example, usually, managers don’t embarrass employees in front of others. But Andy Grove once told an employee who came late to a meeting, “All I have in this world is time, and you are wasting my time.” Why are these styles so different?

In peacetime, leaders try to get the most out of current chances. They encourage creativity and ideas from everyone for many goals. In wartime, the company has only one chance and must hit the target no matter what. The company’s survival depends on everyone following the mission exactly.

When Steve Jobs came back to Apple, the company was almost bankrupt, a clear wartime situation. He needed everyone to work exactly how he said, with no room for extra creativity outside the main goal. In contrast, when Google became the leader in search, their management encouraged peacetime creativity by letting employees spend 20% of their time on their own new projects.

Both peacetime and wartime management can work well, but they are very different. The peacetime CEO is not the same as the wartime CEO.
