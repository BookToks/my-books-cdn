Other ambitious people on your team will quickly notice and start asking for raises too. News spreads fast. Keep in mind, these raise requests don’t always have to be based on how well someone is actually doing their job.

You’ll end up spending more time handling office politics instead of focusing on real work problems. Also, if your company’s board is smart, you won’t be able to give raises to everyone whenever they ask. So raises will be given out in the order people ask for them.

You also say he has to be a strong leader so other top people want to work with him. 

A week later, another executive comes to you stressed out. She says the CFO asked her if she’d work for him. She also says he told her you’re preparing him to be the COO, and that’s his final goal. Did that really happen?
