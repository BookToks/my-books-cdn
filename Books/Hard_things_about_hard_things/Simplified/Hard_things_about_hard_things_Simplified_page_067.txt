You didnâ€™t succeed in fitting the new executive into the company. Bringing someone new into an important position is hard.  

Other workers will judge her quickly, she might expect different things than you do, and the job might not be very clear.  

Make sure you look over and fix your plan for bringing someone new on board after you let an executive go.
