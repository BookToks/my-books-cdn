Sometimes, you have to make the best choice even when there are no good options. When you feel like hiding or giving up, those are the moments you can actually make the biggest difference as a CEO. In the rest of this chapter, I’ll share some tips on how to get through tough times without quitting or feeling sick.

Most management books teach you how to do things the right way so you don’t mess up. But these lessons show you what to do after you’ve already messed up. The good news is, I’ve made plenty of mistakes, and every other CEO has too.

I put this part first even though it talks about serious stuff like firing executives and laying people off. This follows an old warrior’s rule called Bushido: always remember that death is possible. If a warrior thinks about death every day, he will act in the right way.

In the same way, if a CEO remembers these lessons, she will stay focused on hiring, training, and building the right company culture.
