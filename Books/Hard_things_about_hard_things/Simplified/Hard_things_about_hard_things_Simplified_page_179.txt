Most CEOs are usually Ones, which means they like making clear and efficient decisions. If the CEO doesn’t like making really tough choices, the company’s processes will become slow and messy.

If you’re a One, having another One on your team can cause problems because they want to lead their own way instead of following yours. This can confuse the company and make employees work in different directions. That’s why many great One CEOs hire mostly Twos and Functional Ones to help them.

Now, what happens when it’s time to replace the CEO?

Since most companies have Ones as CEOs and Twos working under them, choosing a new CEO can be tricky. Should the company promote someone from the current team who is probably a Two? Microsoft did this in 2000 when they replaced Bill Gates, a classic One, with Steve Ballmer, his number two. Or should they pick a One from lower in the company? General Electric did this in 1981 when they promoted Jack Welch, who was two levels below his bosses. This was a bold move because he became the youngest CEO in GE’s history.

Most board members find it hard to believe that there could be a One deep in the company who’s better qualified than the top executives.

Both choices have problems. Promoting a Two means decision making might slow down, and the company could lose its edge. Also, top Ones like Paul Maritz and Brad Silverberg might leave, as happened at Microsoft.

If you promote a One from below, like GE did with Welch, many executives may quit because they were passed over. At GE, almost all the old executives left quickly. This kind of change works for big companies like GE, but in fast-changing tech companies, losing a lot of leaders at once can be very risky.
