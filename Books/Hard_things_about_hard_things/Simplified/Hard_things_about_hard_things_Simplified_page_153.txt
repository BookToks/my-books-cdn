CREATING A COMPANY CULTURE

When I talk about company culture, I’m not talking about things like company values or how happy employees are. I’m talking about creating a way of working that will:

- Make you different from other companies  
- Make sure important values last, like making customers happy or creating great products  
- Help you find employees who really fit with your goals  

Culture can mean many things, but this is what I want to focus on here.

When you start building your culture, remember that most of what people call your company’s culture will actually grow over time from how you and your first employees act. So, it’s smart to focus on just a few key culture ideas that will shape lots of behavior for a long time.

In his popular book Built to Last, Jim Collins said that companies that last a long time often have a “cultlike culture.” This sounds confusing because it might make you think that if your culture is weird enough and you are super obsessed with it, you will succeed.

That’s kind of true, but not exactly. What Collins really meant is that if your culture is designed well, it might look cultlike later on, but that’s not what you aim for at first. You don’t have to try to make your company seem strange to outsiders. Instead, you should think about how to change what people do every day in a big way.

A good culture idea should be easy to do but change lots of behavior. The secret is shock value. If you add something to your culture that’s so surprising it always gets people talking, it will change how they act. Like in The Godfather, if you want a Hollywood boss to give someone a job, he might say no. But if you put a horse’s head in his bed, the person won’t be unemployed anymore. Shock works great to change behavior.

Here are three examples:
