THE STRUGGLE Every entrepreneur starts their company with a clear dream of success. You want to create an awesome place and hire the smartest people to work with you.

Together, you will make a cool product that makes customers happy and makes the world a little better. It’s going to be amazing.

But after working day and night to make your dream come true, you wake up and see that things didn’t go as planned. Your company isn’t like the perfect story you heard when you started. Your product has problems that are hard to fix. The market isn’t where you expected it to be. Your employees are losing hope, and some have quit. Some of those who left were really smart, making the others wonder if they should stay. You’re running low on money, and your investor tells you it will be tough to get more cash because of a big economic problem in Europe. You lose a fight with a competitor. You lose a loyal customer.

You lose a great employee. It feels like everything is closing in. Where did you mess up?

Why didn’t your company work out like you hoped? Are you good enough to do this? As your dreams turn into nightmares, you find yourself in the Struggle.
