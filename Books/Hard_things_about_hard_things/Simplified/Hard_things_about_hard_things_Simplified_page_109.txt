STEP 2. RUN A PROCESS THAT FINDS THE RIGHT PERSON

To find the right executive, you need to take the info you have and turn it into a plan that helps you pick the best candidate. Here’s the plan I like to use.

First, write down the strengths you want and the weaknesses you can accept.

To make sure you cover everything, include these questions when hiring executives: Will the person be really good at their job? Are they great at handling day-to-day work? Will they help shape the company’s future? This means, are they smart enough? Will they work well with the team? Being effective is important. Someone can be liked but not helpful, or they can be disliked but really get things done. The second is better.

Not all these points matter the same for every job. Make sure you balance them right. Usually, being great at operations matters more for a VP of engineering or sales than for a VP of marketing or CFO.

Make questions that check these points (see the appendix).

Writing these questions is important, even if you don’t ask them directly. It helps you get clear on what you want. (See the appendix for sample questions about sales and operations.)

Put together the right interview team and do the interviews.

Build your interview team carefully.
