In the meeting, since it’s the employee’s meeting, the manager should talk only 10% of the time and listen 90% of the time. This is different from most one-on-one meetings.

The manager’s job is not to set the agenda or do most of the talking, but to help the employee share the important issues. This is even more important if the employee is shy. If you manage engineers, learning to get these issues out is a big skill to have.

Here are some good questions to ask in one-on-ones: If we could get better at anything, how would we do it? What is the biggest problem in our company? Why? What do you not like about working here? Who is doing a great job in the company? Who do you look up to? If you were me, what would you change? What don’t you like about the product? What is the biggest chance we are missing? What should we be doing that we are not? Are you happy working here?

In the end, the most important thing is to make sure the best ideas, biggest problems, and the hardest employee issues reach the people who can fix them. One-on-ones are a great way to do this, but if you have a better method, go for it!
