“Bankruptcy.” To someone listening without emotion, it might sound like Bill was just wisely telling me to have a backup plan. But something in his voice and eyes said something else. He believed the backup plan was actually the real plan.

The conversation reminded me of a story a friend told me about his brother, a young doctor. A 35-year-old man came to see the doctor. The man looked terrible. His eyes were sunken and his skin was pale.

The young doctor knew something was wrong but couldn’t figure out what. So, he asked an older doctor to help. The older doctor checked the man and then sent him home. After that, he told the young doctor, “He’s dead.” The young doctor was shocked. “What do you mean? He just walked out alive!” The older doctor said, “He doesn’t know it yet, but he’s dead. He had a heart attack, and at his age, his body can’t recover. He won’t make it.” Three weeks later, the man died.

I felt like Bill was telling me the same thing. Even though I was trying hard to finish the deal, he thought I was already dead and didn’t realize it. It was really hard for him to say that, and only a true friend would be brave enough to tell me something so bad. It was even harder for me to hear. He wanted me to get ready, both emotionally and financially, for the company’s end. The chances of saving the company during the tech industry’s tough time were almost zero. Most likely, I was dead.

I never made that backup plan. During the tough Loudcloud Series C and IPO times, I learned something important: Startup CEOs shouldn’t think about the odds. When you build a company, you must believe there’s a way to succeed, and you can’t care about how likely it is. You just have to find that way. It doesn’t matter if your chances are 9 out of 10 or 1 out of 1000; your job is the same.

In the end, I did find the answer. We finished the deal with EDS, and the company didn’t go bankrupt. I wasn’t mad at Bill. Even now, I’m thankful he told me the truth about the odds. But I don’t believe in statistics.

I believe in calculus.

People always ask me, “What’s the secret to being a successful CEO?” Sadly, there is no secret, but if there is one skill that really stands out, it’s the ability to focus.
