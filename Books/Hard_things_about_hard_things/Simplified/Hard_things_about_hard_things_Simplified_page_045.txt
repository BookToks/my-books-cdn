BladeLogic had come up and was winning important customers from us. We lost several deals to them and missed our sales goals for the quarter. Our stock price dropped back down to $2.90.

Here we go again.

With a product that wasn’t doing well, a falling stock price, and a tired team, I knew we were in big trouble. To make things worse, Marc, who had been working full-time with me on Loudcloud and Opsware as the chairman of the board, decided to start another company called Ning. The success or failure of Opsware was really up to me and the team now, but the timing was awful.

Not only was the company struggling, but our most visible leader was moving on to something else. Damn. After everything we had been through, how could I ask the team to take on another huge challenge? How could I find the strength to do it myself?

I felt like I had no more stories, no more speeches, and no more energy to pump everyone up. So, I decided to be honest with the team and see what would happen. I called a meeting with all the engineers and said: “I have some bad news. BladeLogic is beating us, and it’s because of our product. If this keeps up, I’ll have to sell the company for cheap. We can’t survive without a winning product. So, I need every one of you to do something. Tonight, talk seriously with your wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, or whoever cares most about you and tell them, ‘Ben needs me for the next six months.’ I need you to come in early and stay late. I’ll buy you dinner, and I’ll stay here with you. We have one last chance, and we have to nail it.” At the time, I felt awful asking the team for such a big sacrifice.

Surprisingly, while writing this book, I realized I probably should have felt proud. Here’s what Ted Crossman, one of my best engineers, said about that time and the project called the Darwin Project many years later: Of all the times I remember at Loudcloud and Opsware, the Darwin Project was the hardest but also the most fun. I worked seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. for six months straight. It was intense. Once a week, I had a date night with my wife where I gave her my full attention from 6 p.m. to midnight. The next day, even if it was Saturday, I’d be back at the office at 8 a.m. and stay through dinner. I got home between 10 and 11 p.m.

Every night. And it wasn’t just me. Everyone in the office was doing the same.
