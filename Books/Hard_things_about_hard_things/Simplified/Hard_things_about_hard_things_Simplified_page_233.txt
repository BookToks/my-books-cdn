Does she think in a planned way or just react sometimes?

Would I want to work with her?

Is she completely honest or does she sometimes lie?

Does she ask me sharp and sudden questions or just the ones she prepared before?

Can she understand and talk to different kinds of people?

Is she really good at explaining things?

Has she learned about the company before this?

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
