Scott told me what happened, saying, “Can you believe they approved the deal and didn’t notice the cash was restricted until now? We gave them all the papers.” Right before we were about to leave for the IPO road show, I called a meeting for the whole company to share two pieces of news: First, we were going public, or at least we were going to try. Second, the company’s value had dropped so much that we had to do a reverse stock split, two shares for one.

I thought the first part would be okay, but I was worried about how people would react to the second part. We had to reverse split the stock to raise the price per share high enough to go public. In theory, a reverse split shouldn’t change anything. Each employee owned a certain percentage of the company. The company had a total number of shares. Multiply the total shares by the percentage, and you get how many shares each employee owns. If you cut the number of shares in half, employees would have half the shares but still own the same percentage of the company. Nothing changed.

But it did. As we grew from zero to six hundred employees in less than eighteen months, things got crazy fast. Some excited managers made the dream sound even bigger. They only talked about shares, not percentages, and told stories about a possible $100 per share price.

Employees started imagining how much money they could make based on that price. I knew this was happening, but I never thought we would have to reverse split the stock, so I didn’t worry about it. Like many other mistakes I made back then, I should have worried.

My wife, Felicia, came to the all-company meeting like she always did. This time her parents were visiting, so they came too. The meeting did not go well.

People didn’t realize how close we were to failing, so the news about the IPO didn’t make them happy. The news about the reverse split made them even more upset—in fact, it made them really angry. I had literally cut their fantasy number in half, and they didn’t like it. Nobody said mean things to me directly, but my in-laws heard everything. As my father-in-law said, “it wasn’t nothin’ nice.” My mother-in-law, Loretta, asked my wife, “Why does everybody hate Ben so much?” Felicia, who is usually very lively and outgoing, was just recovering from surgery, so she wasn’t her usual bubbly self.

She felt down. My in-laws were sad. The employees were mad. I had no idea if I could raise the money. What a way to start a road show.
