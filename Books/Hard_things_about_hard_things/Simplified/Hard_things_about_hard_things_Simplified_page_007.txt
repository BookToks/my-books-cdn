I’ve been through tough times and learned a lot from them. Even though situations might be different, the important lessons stay the same.

For the last few years, I’ve shared these lessons in blog posts that millions of people have read. Many readers asked me about the stories behind those lessons. This book tells those stories for the first time and includes the lessons from the blog.

I’ve also been inspired by friends, advisors, family, and hip-hop/rap music. Hip-hop artists want to be great and successful, and they see themselves as business people. Their themes about competing, making money, and being misunderstood help explain the hard parts of life.

I share my experiences to give clues and hope to others who are trying to build something from nothing.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
