WHAT SHOULD YOU DO FIRST?

The best place to start is with the topic that matters most to your employees: the knowledge and skills they need to do their job. This is called functional training. Functional training can be simple, like teaching a new employee what you expect from them, or it can be more complex, like a multiweek engineering course to help new workers learn all the details about your product. The training should fit the specific job. If you choose the more detailed course, make sure to get the best experts and the manager involved. A cool bonus is that this kind of training helps build a strong, positive company culture way more than any big company meetings about culture.

Another important part of a company’s training is management training. This is a good way to set clear rules for your managers. Do you want them to have regular one-on-one meetings with their team? To give feedback on performance? To train their employees? To agree on goals with their team? If yes, you need to tell them, because many tech companies don’t do this well. After setting these expectations, the next training courses should teach managers how to do these things, like writing a review or holding a one-on-one meeting.

Once you have management training and functional training ready, you can do more. One great thing about building a tech company is the chance to hire amazing people. Encourage your best workers to share their top skills. Training in things like negotiating, interviewing, and finance will make your company stronger and boost employee happiness. Teaching can also be a proud achievement for employees who become experts.
