He made the best and bravest choice he could and didn’t sell the company. I think this will be the most important moment in his career.

Right after Hamlet decided, the whole board and executive team quickly supported him. Why? If they really wanted to sell the company enough to tell the CEO to give up his dream, how could they change their minds so fast? It turns out they wanted to sell because Hamlet seemed unsure—the team just followed what they thought the CEO wanted.

Hamlet didn’t know this and thought their wish to sell was based on careful thinking. Luckily, he had the guts to make the right choice.

The problem is like this: Social pressure makes it seem better to follow the crowd than to do what you believe is right. If you are right but go against the crowd, few people remember you made the decision, but the company does well. If you are wrong and go against the crowd, you get blamed and maybe even lose your job.

If you follow the crowd and are right, everyone remembers your choice and the company does well. But if you follow the crowd and are wrong, you don’t get much blame, but the company suffers.

It might look safer to just go along with the crowd when the choice is hard. But if you fall for this, the crowd will mess with your thinking and make a clear decision seem uncertain. That’s why having courage is so important.

Courage, like good character, can be built. When I made tough choices running Loudcloud and Opsware, I never felt brave. I was often really scared. I never stopped feeling scared, but after practicing, I learned to ignore those feelings. That’s what building courage is about.

In life, everyone has to choose between doing what’s popular, easy, and wrong, or what’s lonely, hard, and right. These choices get harder all the time.
