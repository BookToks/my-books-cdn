THE FREAKY FRIDAY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE

A long time ago, I faced a really tough problem at work. Two great teams, Customer Support and Sales Engineering, started fighting with each other. The sales engineers complained that Customer Support was slow to respond, didn’t fix product problems, and made it hard to make sales and keep customers happy. On the other hand, Customer Support said the sales engineers sent in too many bug reports without checking if they were real problems, ignored good ideas to fix things, and acted like every issue was a huge emergency.

Besides the complaints, the teams just didn’t like each other. To make things worse, they had to work together all the time for the company to run well. Both teams had amazing people and great bosses, so no one could be fired or moved down. I didn’t know what to do.

At that time, I happened to watch the movie Freaky Friday. It stars Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster. (There’s also a good remake with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan.) In the story, a mother and daughter get really frustrated with each other and wish they could switch places. Then, magically, they do.

During the movie, by living in each other’s bodies, they start to understand what the other person goes through. When they switch back, they become really good friends. After watching both versions, I realized I had found the answer: I would try a Freaky Friday management technique.

The next day, I told the heads of Sales Engineering and Customer Support that they would switch jobs. I said that, like in the movie, they would keep their own minds but get new bodies.

Permanently. At first, they reacted like Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan in the remake—screaming in horror.
