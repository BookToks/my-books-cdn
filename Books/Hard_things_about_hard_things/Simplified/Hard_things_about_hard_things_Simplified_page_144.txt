You don’t have to be bipolar to act flaky, but flaky behavior usually has a serious problem behind it. It can come from self-destructive habits, drug use, or working extra jobs without telling anyone. A company works as a team, and no matter how talented someone is, they won’t help the team if you can’t trust them to do their work properly.

EXAMPLE 3: THE JERK This type of bad employee can be found anywhere in a company but is worst when they are a boss. Most bosses can be rude sometimes to make a point or get attention. That’s not what I mean.

If someone is always acting like a jerk, it can really hurt the company. As a company gets bigger, communicating with lots of people is a big challenge. If one person is mean or aggressive, people might stop talking when that person is around. For example, if the marketing boss always yells at anyone who brings up problems, no one will want to talk about marketing issues. This can make communication between leaders stop, and the whole company starts to fall apart. This only happens if the jerk is really smart and important.

If the jerk isn’t important, people won’t care when they are rude. Their words only matter if they have power. If one of your important people is ruining communication, you need to get rid of them.

WHEN DO YOU HOLD THE BUS?

Famous football coach John Madden was once asked if he would keep a player like Terrell Owens on his team. Owens was super talented but also a big jerk. Madden said, “If you wait for everyone on the team, you’ll be so late you’ll miss the game, so you can’t do that. The bus has to leave on time.

But sometimes, you’ll have a player so good that you wait for him, but only him.”
