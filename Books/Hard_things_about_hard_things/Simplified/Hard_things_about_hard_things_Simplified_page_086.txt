IBM.” Marc answered quickly: “Got it. Let’s hire him!” That’s how I took an important step to build a top software team from the mess left by Loudcloud. As I got to know Mark over the years, everything I learned during the interview and reference check was true. He wasn’t easy to fit in with the team, but he was a genius. I needed his genius and helped him fit in. I don’t think every team member ever felt totally comfortable with Mark, but in the end, they all agreed he was the best person for the job.

My old boss Jim Barksdale used to say, “We take care of the people, the products, and the profits—in that order.” It’s a simple phrase, but it means a lot.

“Taking care of the people” is the hardest part, and if you don’t do it, the other two don’t matter. Taking care of the people means making your company a good place to work. Most workplaces are not good. When companies get big, important work can get ignored, the hardest workers might be passed over by the best office politicians, and boring rules can kill creativity and fun.

When everything went wrong—from the dot-com crash to NASDAQ almost removing the company—the things we learned in this chapter saved us. If your company is a good place to work, you might also last long enough to reach your big success.
