We looked into the possibility of buying the company and did a quick check to see how interested people were in the market for mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

During that check, eleven companies made offers to buy us. This showed me that we had reached the highest local price for Opsware. Basically, the buyers believed the market was very important, and we couldn't expect to get a better price by trying harder. After thinking a lot and analyzing the situation, I decided that this highest price was better than what we could get in the next three to five years. So, I sold the company to Hewlett-Packard for $1.65 billion. I believe that was the right choice.

The emotional side of this decision is really confusing.

How can you sell your company when you personally hired every employee and shared your big dream of a successful, independent business? How can you give up on your dream?

How can you walk away from complete financial freedom for yourself and your family? Aren’t you in business to make money? How much money does one person really need?

How do you deal with the part of you that wants to stay and the part that wants to sell? They seem totally opposite, but the trick is to quiet both feelings.

Here are some tips for calming those emotions: Get paid a salary. Most investors like founders who put everything into their company and have little to gain if it fails. Because of this, they usually want the CEO to have a low salary at first. This is good because it stops the CEO from quitting when things get tough. But once the company grows and becomes a real business, it makes sense to pay the CEO a normal salary.

More specifically, once the company is successful and attractive to buyers, it’s smart to pay the CEO well. That way, the choice to keep or sell the company won’t depend on the CEO’s personal money problems, like living in a tiny apartment and needing to sell just to improve their own situation.
