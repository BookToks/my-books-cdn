WHY STARTUPS SHOULD TRAIN THEIR PEOPLE

I learned why startups should train their people when I worked at Netscape. People at McDonald’s get training for their jobs, but people with much harder jobs often don’t. That doesn’t make sense. Would you want to stand behind someone at McDonald’s who wasn’t trained? Or use software made by an engineer who was never told how the rest of the code worked? Many companies think their workers are so smart they don’t need training. That’s just silly.

When I first became a manager, I wasn’t sure about training. 

It made sense for tech companies, but my experience with training programs before was not great. They were run by outside groups who didn’t really know our business and taught stuff that wasn’t useful. Then I read chapter 16 of Andy Grove’s book, High Output Management. The chapter is called “Why Training Is the Boss’s Job,” and it changed how I thought.

Grove said, “Most managers think training employees should be left to others. I believe the manager should do it himself.” When I was director of product management at Netscape, I was frustrated because many product managers didn’t help the business much.

Following Andy’s advice, I wrote a short paper called “Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager” to explain what I expected from the team. (You can see that paper on page 111.) What happened next surprised me. My team’s performance got better right away. Product managers I almost gave up on became really good. Soon, I led the best team in the company. After this, when I started Loudcloud, I put a lot of effort into training. I believe that helped us succeed. And it all began with a simple choice to train my people and a simple training paper. Now, I want to share what I learned from Andy Grove and explain why, what, and how.
