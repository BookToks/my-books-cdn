Competition changes, the market changes, and people change. So, like playing a super tricky game of chess in Star Trek, there’s always a move to make. Think you have no options? How about taking your company public with only $2 million in past sales and 340 employees, planning to make $75 million next year? I did that. I did it in 2001, which was one of the worst times ever for a tech company to go public. I had only six weeks of money left. There is always a move.

If you keep playing, you might get lucky. In tech, tomorrow is never like today. If you survive long enough to see tomorrow, it might bring the answer that seems impossible right now.

Don’t take it personally. The trouble you’re in is probably your own fault. You hired the people. You made the choices. But you knew the job was risky when you took it. Everyone makes mistakes. Every CEO makes thousands of mistakes. Giving yourself a bad grade won’t help.

Remember, this is what separates grown-ups from kids. If you want to be great, this is the challenge. If you don’t want to be great, you shouldn’t have started a company.

THE END. When you’re struggling, nothing feels easy or right. It feels like you’ve fallen into a deep hole and might never get out. From my own experience, if it weren’t for some unexpected luck and help, I would have been lost.

So to all of you going through it, I hope you find strength and peace.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
