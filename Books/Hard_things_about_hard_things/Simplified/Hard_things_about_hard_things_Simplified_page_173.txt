THE FINE LINE BETWEEN FEAR AND COURAGE

“I tell my kids, what’s the difference between a hero and a coward? What’s the difference between being scared and being brave? There’s actually no difference.

They both feel the same thing. They’re both afraid of getting hurt or dying. The coward just won’t face what they need to face. The hero, on the other hand, fights those feelings and does what needs to be done. But both the hero and the coward feel fear. People judge you by what you do, not by how you feel.” —CUS D’AMATO, LEGENDARY BOXING TRAINER

When my partners and I meet with business owners, the two main things we look for are smart ideas and courage. From my time as a CEO, I learned that making the right choice often tests your courage more than your brainpower.

Usually, the right choice is clear, but the pressure to choose wrong can feel huge. It starts with small stuff.

When founders come to pitch our firm—one is the CEO and the other is the president—the talk often goes like this: “Who’s running the company?” “We are,” they say.

“Who makes the final call?” “We do.” “How long will you keep it that way?” “Forever.” “So you’ve decided to make it harder for every worker to get things done just so you don’t have to pick who’s really in charge, right?” That usually leads to silence.

It should be obvious that it’s easier for employees to go to one boss instead of two. It’s not really that complicated. But sadly, the social pressure right now often beats the long-term benefits.
