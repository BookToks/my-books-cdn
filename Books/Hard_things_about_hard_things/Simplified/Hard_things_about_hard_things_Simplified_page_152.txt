PROGRAMMING YOUR CULTURE

If you ask ten founders what company culture means, you’ll get ten different answers. Some say it’s about how the office looks, others say it’s about choosing the right employees. Some think it’s about values, fun, teamwork, finding people who think alike, or even being a little cult-like.

So, what exactly is culture? Does it really matter? And if it does, how much time should you spend on it?

Let’s start with the second question. The most important thing for any tech startup is to build a product that’s at least ten times better than what’s already out there. Being two or three times better won’t make enough people switch to your product fast enough or in big enough numbers. The second thing is you have to take the market quickly. If you can do something ten times better, other companies might figure it out too. So, you have to act fast and grab the market before they do. It’s really hard to beat a new market leader because very few products are that much better than the competition.

If you don’t do these two things, your company culture won’t matter at all. There are many companies with amazing cultures that still went bankrupt. Culture alone can’t make a company successful.

So, why care about culture? There are three reasons: First, culture matters if it helps you reach the goals above.

Second, as your company grows, culture helps keep your important values, makes your company a nicer place to work, and helps it do better in the future.

Third, and maybe most important, after you and your team work so hard to build a successful company, it would be a huge disappointment if the culture is so bad that even you don’t want to work there.
