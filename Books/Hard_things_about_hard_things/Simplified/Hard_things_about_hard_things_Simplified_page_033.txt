Some people made a slide deck explaining why starting Oxide was a crazy, bad, and stupid idea. They said it would take important resources away from our main business and that the product would definitely fail.

I let them show all forty-five slides without asking a single question.

When they finished, I said, “Did I ask for this presentation?” That was the first time I switched from being a calm CEO to a CEO ready for a fight.

Because of my role and the fact that we were a public company, only I had the full picture. I knew we were in big trouble.

No one else could fix the problem except me, and I was done listening to advice from people who didn’t understand everything. I wanted all the facts, but I didn’t want anyone telling me what to do next. This was serious.

Because of how things were going in the market, raising money was almost impossible, and the only way was through something called a private investment in public equity (PIPE). We worked with Morgan Stanley to find investors and raise $50 million.

It was Monday morning, and we were ready to start raising the PIPE on Tuesday when I got a call. “Ben, the CEO of Atriax is on the phone; should I put him through?” Atriax, an online foreign currency exchange backed by big banks, was our biggest customer. Atriax paid us more than...
