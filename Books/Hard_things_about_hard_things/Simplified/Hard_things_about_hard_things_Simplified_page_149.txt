Nobody thought it was possible—that’s exactly why you hired them.

Finally, your new executive needs to be more than just someone who meets goals.

She should be well-rounded and a real part of the team. Bill Campbell created a great way to measure executives in a balanced way that can help you with this. He breaks performance into four parts:

1. Results against objectives. Once you set a high standard, it’s easy to check if your executive meets it.

2. Management. Even if an executive does a great job reaching goals, it doesn’t mean she is building a strong and loyal team. It’s important to see how well she manages people, not just if she hits her goals.

3. Innovation. An executive might reach her goals for the quarter but ignore the future. For example, an engineering manager could meet deadlines by building a bad system that won’t work for the next project. This is why you need to look beyond the final results and see how things are actually made.

4. Working with peers. This might not be obvious, but executives must be good at talking to, supporting, and getting what they need from other staff. You should check how they do in this area.

Aw man, hiring your first senior people might feel like you’re giving up something important. If you’re not careful, you might lose the soul of your company. But to create something from nothing, you have to take risks and beat the clock. That means hiring the best talent, knowledge, and experience, even if it means working with people of very different ages.
