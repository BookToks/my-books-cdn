Why would you do this? You’re not perfect at your job either. How can you be so okay with betraying me?

These are strong feelings, so get ready for a serious talk.

Funny enough, the best way to have an emotional talk is to stay calm. To do that, you need to be sure about what you’ve decided and what you want to do.

The most important thing is to be sure you really want to do this. If you go into a talk about a demotion without being sure, you’ll end up with a big mess: a messy situation and a messed-up relationship. You also have to accept that the employee might quit. Because of all the strong feelings, there’s no promise they’ll want to stay. If you can’t afford to lose them, you shouldn’t make this change.

Lastly, you need to decide the best role for them in the company. The obvious choice is to have them work under their new boss, but that might not be best for them, the boss, or their career. Your loyal employee knows a lot about the company, competitors, customers, and the market, which the new boss might not know. This can be good because they can help the new boss learn fast. But with feelings of embarrassment and betrayal, this could cause big problems.

Another problem is that moving them under the new boss clearly looks like a demotion to their career. A better option might be to move them to another part of the company where their skills can help. This move can help them learn new skills and help the company at the same time. For younger workers, learning about different parts of the company is really useful.

But this might not solve everything. They might not want a new job; they might be dead set on keeping their current one, so be ready for that too.

Once you’ve decided to hire someone above your friend and picked the other options you want to offer, you can have the talk. Remember, you can’t let them keep their old job, but you can be fair and honest. To do that, use the right words and make it clear that you’ve...
