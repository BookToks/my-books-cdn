Your own staff should be involved. Usually, different managers who know the employee’s work will take part, and the top leaders or board of directors should be included too. The goal of this process is two things. First, it shows the company tried to pick the best person for the promotion. Second, it helps your team explain why you made those promotion choices.

Be careful with “he said, she said.” When your company gets bigger, team members will sometimes complain about each other. Sometimes these complaints can be really harsh. Be careful how you listen and what message you send. If you just listen without defending the person being talked about, people might think you agree with the criticism. If that happens, word will spread fast, and the person being criticized might lose respect and stop being effective.

There are two kinds of complaints you’ll get: 1. Complaints about how an executive acts, and 2. Complaints about how well an executive does their job. The best way to handle the first kind is to get both people—the one complaining and the one being complained about—together to talk it out. Usually, this meeting will fix the problem, improve behavior, and help their relationship if it was broken. Don’t try to fix behavior problems without both people there because it can cause more drama and politics.

The second kind of complaints—about job skills or performance—are rarer and more complicated. If an executive complains about a peer’s ability, it probably means there is a serious problem with one of them. When you hear this, you’ll usually find out one of two things: either you already knew about the problem, or you’re hearing something surprising.

If you already knew, it means you waited too long to fix the issue. No matter your reasons for trying to help the struggling executive, you took too much time, and now the company has lost trust in them. You need to fix this fast. Most of the time, this means you have to fire the executive. While I’ve seen some executives improve,
