You should do the same in your company.

WHY YOU SHOULD TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE

Almost everyone who starts a tech company knows that people are the most important part. Good startups spend a lot of time hiring the right people. But many stop investing in their employees after hiring them. There are four big reasons why you shouldn’t do that.

1. Productivity  
I often see startups keeping track of how many people they interview and hire. But the most important thing they don’t track is how many new employees actually become productive. Without this, they miss how valuable training really is. If they measured productivity, they might find out that all their hiring efforts aren’t paying off. Even if CEOs see that new workers aren’t doing well, they often think they don’t have time to train them.

Andy Grove shows that this is wrong. Training is one of the best things a manager can do. Imagine you give four lectures to your team. If you spend three hours preparing for each hour of teaching, that’s twelve hours total. If you have ten people in your class, next year they will work about twenty thousand hours for your company. If your training improves their work by just 1%, your company gets two hundred extra hours of work from just those twelve hours you spent.

2. Performance management  
When people ask managers questions, they often want to know if the manager has ever fired anyone.
