The CEO has to set the background for how everyone in the company works.

This background helps people understand why their work matters, brings everyone together, helps make choices, and keeps people motivated. Clear goals help, but they don’t tell the whole story.

The real story is more than just goals. It answers the big question: why? Why should someone want to work here? Why get excited about the company? Why buy its products? Why invest money? How does the company make the world better?

When a company explains its story well, everyone—workers, partners, customers, investors, and reporters—understands it. If the story isn’t clear, you’ll hear people say things like, “The reporters don’t get it,” or “Who’s in charge of the company’s plan?” or “We have great technology, but need help with marketing.”

The CEO doesn’t have to come up with the company’s vision or story. But they have to keep it safe and make sure it stays clear.

The CEO makes sure the company’s story is interesting and easy to understand.

The story isn’t just a short mission statement. It can be long and detailed, but it has to be told and it has to be strong. A company without a story usually doesn’t have a good plan.

Want to see a great company story? Read the letter Jeff Bezos wrote to Amazon’s shareholders in 1997. Instead of a short mission, he explained everything in detail, so everyone knew what Amazon was all about.
