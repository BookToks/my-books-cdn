INTRODUCTION  
“This is the real world, dude, school’s over. They stole your dreams, and you don’t even know who did it.” —KANYE WEST, “GORGEOUS”  

Every time I read a management or self-help book, I think, “That’s okay, but that’s not the really hard part.” The hard part isn’t setting a big, crazy goal. The hard part is firing people when you don’t reach that goal. The hard part isn’t hiring great people. The hard part is when those great people start acting like they deserve everything and ask for too much. The hard part isn’t making an organizational chart. The hard part is getting people to actually talk to each other in the group you just set up. The hard part isn’t dreaming big. The hard part is waking up scared in the middle of the night when your dream turns into a nightmare.  

The problem with these books is that they try to give you a step-by-step guide for challenges that don’t have guides. There’s no guide for really tricky, changing situations. There’s no guide for building a high-tech company; no guide for leading a group out of trouble; no guide for making hit songs; no guide for playing NFL quarterback; no guide for running for president; and no guide for getting your team motivated when your business is failing. That’s what makes hard things hard—there’s no one way to handle them.  

Still, there are some tips and lessons that can help with the hard stuff.  

I’m not trying to give you a formula in this book. Instead, I’m sharing my story and the problems I’ve faced. As a business owner, a CEO, and now as someone who invests in new companies, I still use these lessons—especially when I work with new founders who are CEOs. Building a company always comes with tough times.  

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
