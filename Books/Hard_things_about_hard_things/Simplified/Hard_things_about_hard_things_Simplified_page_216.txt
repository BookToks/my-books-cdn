I live with my husband and two kids, and it’s either that or divorce. Be honest with the company. One question every startup CEO gets from employees is, “Are you selling the company?” This is a really hard question. If she says nothing, employees might think the company is for sale. If she says “at the right price,” employees will wonder what that price is and might even ask. If the company ever reaches that price, employees will assume it will be sold.

If she avoids the question by saying “the company is not for sale,” employees might feel upset if it ever is sold. Even more, the CEO might feel like she is letting employees down, and that feeling could affect her choices. One way to avoid these problems is to explain what was talked about before: If the company finds a product people love in a big market and has a good chance to be number one, then it will probably stay independent. If not, it will probably be sold. This is a good way to explain what the investors want without going against what employees want, and it’s true.

FINAL THOUGHT When you have to decide whether to sell your company, it’s never an easy choice. But getting ready both in your mind and feelings will help.
