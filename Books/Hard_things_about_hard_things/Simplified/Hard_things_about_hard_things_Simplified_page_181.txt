FOLLOW THE LEADER There is no one perfect way to be a CEO. Different styles—like those of Steve Jobs, Bill Campbell, and Andy Grove—can all work well.

Maybe the most important thing a CEO needs is leadership. But what is leadership, and how do we think about it for a CEO? Are great leaders born with it, or do they learn it?

Most people say leadership is like what Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart said about pornography: “I know it when I see it.” For us, this means a leader’s quality is shown by how many, how good, and how different the people are who want to follow them.

So, why do people want to follow a leader? We look for three main traits: The ability to explain the vision The right kind of ambition The ability to make the vision happen Let’s look at these one by one.

THE ABILITY TO EXPLAIN THE VISION: THE STEVE JOBS TRAIT Can the leader explain a vision that is exciting, clear, and powerful?

Even more, can the leader do this when things are really hard? Like when the company isn’t making money and it doesn’t make sense for anyone to keep working there, can the leader still explain a vision that makes people want to stay?

I think Jobs’s best skill as a visionary leader was getting very talented people to keep following him at NeXT, even when the company was struggling. Also, he got Apple employees to believe in his vision when the company was almost bankrupt. It’s hard to imagine any other leader being so convincing to do these things one after another. That’s why we call this the Steve Jobs trait.
