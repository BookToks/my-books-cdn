If you’re a professional boxer, you will get hit hard. Pro boxers train for years to spot tiny mistakes in how someone moves. If you lift your front foot first to step backward, you’ll be a little off balance for just a moment, and that’s all your opponent needs to hit you.

The same idea applies if you manage a junior employee and they ask about their career growth. You can usually answer naturally and be fine. But when you deal with very ambitious, experienced people, things change. To avoid getting hurt by office politics, you need to improve how you handle things.

THE TECHNIQUE When I became a CEO, I found two important ways to reduce office politics.

1. Hire people with the right kind of ambition. Sometimes people want to succeed but aren’t very political. Not all cases are like that. The fastest way to turn your company into a political mess is to hire people with the wrong kind of ambition. According to Andy Grove, the right kind of ambition means they want the company to succeed first, and their own success happens because the company wins. The wrong kind of ambition means they only care about their own success, no matter what happens to the company.

2. Set strict rules for things that can cause politics and don’t break them.

Some things attract political behavior, like performance reviews and pay, how the company is organized, and promotions. Let’s look at each and how you can create and follow rules that protect the company from bad behavior and political games.

Performance reviews and pay: Many companies wait too long to set up clear ways to review work and decide pay. That doesn’t mean they don’t review people or give raises; it just means they do it in a random way that lets politics take over.
