SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?

First, remember that employees are either really great or you probably wouldn’t want them working for you. So, you’ll either be hiring top-quality people from your friend’s company or just average ones. Don’t think the people you take won’t be missed.

A good rule to follow is my Reflexive Principle of Employee Raiding. It says, “If you’d be shocked and upset if another company hired your employees, then you shouldn’t hire theirs.” There probably aren’t many companies like that, maybe none at all.

To avoid problems, many companies have rules, written or not, that say you need permission from the CEO or a top boss before hiring from certain companies. This way, you can give your friend a chance to keep their employee or say no before you hire them.

The best way to handle this is to be open and honest. When you find out there’s a conflict between hiring a great employee and upsetting your friend, tell the employee you have a business relationship with their current company. Let them know you need to check with the CEO before offering the job. If they don’t want that, you’ll stop the process and keep everything private. Talking to your friend first helps you see how hiring their employee might affect your relationship. It also helps you avoid bad hires because sometimes people who do well in interviews don’t turn out to be good employees.

CLOSING THOUGHTS

In the movie The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Clint Eastwood’s character “The Good” and Eli Wallach’s character “The Ugly” are partners in crime. Wallach is a criminal with a bounty on his head, and they trick people to get the reward money. Eastwood turns Wallach in and collects the money. Wallach is sentenced to be hanged. But just before that happens, Eastwood shoots the rope and frees Wallach, and they share the money. This plan works well until one day Eastwood frees Wallach but tells him, “I don’t think you’ll ever be worth more than three thousand.”
