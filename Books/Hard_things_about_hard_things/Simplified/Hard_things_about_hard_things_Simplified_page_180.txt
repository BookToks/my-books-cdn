The main point might be disappointing for anyone hoping for a simple solution.  

The truth is, there is no easy answer. Changing CEOs is tough. If you hire someone from outside the company, your chances of success go down. If you promote someone from inside, you have to handle the One-Two problem.  

In a perfect world, you’d pick a One, and the rest of the executive team would be happy with your choice. But, unfortunately, things don’t usually work out that smoothly.
