BEING A CEO

The other day, a friend asked me if CEOs are born that way or if they become CEOs over time. I said, “That’s like asking if Jolly Ranchers grow on trees or if they’re made in a factory. Being a CEO isn’t natural.” My friend looked surprised, so I realized it might not be as obvious as I thought.

Most people actually believe the opposite—that CEOs are born, not made. I often hear other investors and board members quickly decide that a founder isn’t “CEO material.” I don’t know how they decide so fast.

But other skills, like boxing, take much longer because they need lots of unnatural moves and special techniques. For example, when moving backward in boxing, you have to lift your back foot first. If you lift your front foot first, you might get hit hard. Making this unnatural move feel natural takes a lot of practice. If you act naturally as a CEO without learning new skills, you might fail badly.

You messed up the buildup and punch line. Go fix it and tell me again tomorrow.” But giving feedback and judging how people do is exactly what a CEO has to do. If she doesn’t, the...
