A common reason companies fire an executive is because when the company gets four times bigger, the executive can’t do the job well anymore. This happens because managing a bigger company is a totally different job. Everyone has to prove they can do the new job since it’s not the same as the old one.

Running a sales team of 200 people across the world is very different from running a small local team of 25 people. Sometimes, the person who managed the small team learns how to handle the big team. If not, you have to hire someone new who can do the bigger job. This doesn’t mean the executive or the system failed; it’s just how things work when a company grows. Trying to ignore this will only cause more problems.

If you make an awesome product and lots of people want it, your company will need to grow really fast. The best way to succeed is by hiring an executive who has already grown a company quickly and successfully before. This is different from just managing a big company or working your way up in a big company. You need someone who knows how to grow fast.

Also, don’t hire this person if you’re not ready to give them a big budget to grow the company. They need resources to do their job. These fast-growth executives are so important that recruiters and investors often tell CEOs to hire them even before the company is ready.

Once you figure out the problem, you can plan what to do next.

STEP 2: TELLING THE BOARD  
Telling the board can be tricky and there are many things that make it harder, like:

This is the fifth or sixth executive you had to fire.

This is the third executive you fired for this same role.

The candidate was recommended by a board member who said they were a superstar.
