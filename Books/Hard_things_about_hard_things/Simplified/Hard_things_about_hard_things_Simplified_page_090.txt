Your friends and family think you're super smart for choosing to work at the “it” company before anyone else knew it was cool. Your résumé looks better because you work at a top company when it's doing really well.

Oh, and you're making a lot of money.

But when things start going badly, all those good reasons to stay turn into reasons to leave. Actually, the only thing that keeps someone working at a company when everything is going wrong—besides needing a paycheck—is if they really like their job.

THINGS ALWAYS GO WRONG  
No company in history has had a stock price that only goes up all the time. In bad companies, when the money stops coming in, the workers leave too. In tech companies, when employees leave, the company’s value drops even more, then more good workers quit, and the whole thing gets worse and worse. These downward spirals are really hard to fix.

BEING A GOOD COMPANY MATTERS  
When I first met Bill Campbell, he was the head of Intuit, on Apple’s board, and a mentor to many top CEOs. But what impressed me most was when he ran GO Corporation back in 1992. The company raised a huge amount of money but lost almost all of it before selling itself for almost nothing to AT&T in 1994.

That probably sounds like a total failure. But I had met many GO employees during my career, like Mike Homer, Danny Shader, Frank Chen, and Stratton Sclavos.

What was amazing is that every one of those employees said GO was one of the best places they ever worked. The best work experience ever, even though their careers didn’t move forward, they didn’t make money, and the company was a big failure. GO was just a good place to work.

This showed me how great a CEO Bill was. John Doerr thought so too, because when Scott Cook needed a CEO for Intuit, John recommended Bill—even though Bill lost a lot of John’s money at GO.
