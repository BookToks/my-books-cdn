She feels powerless. She thinks she can't reach the people in charge, so complaining is the only way she can try to get the truth out.

She is basically a rebel. She won’t be happy unless she’s going against the rules or authority; this can be a deep part of who she is. Sometimes, rebels like her actually make better CEOs than regular workers.

She is immature and doesn’t understand that the people running the company don’t know every little detail, so they aren’t responsible for everything that’s wrong.

It’s often really hard to change situations like this. Once someone speaks out publicly, there’s a lot of pressure to stick to what they said. If he tells fifty of his closest friends that the CEO is the dumbest person ever, changing his mind later will make him lose a lot of trust. Most people don’t want to lose that trust.

Example 2: The Flake. Some really smart people can be totally unreliable. At Opsware, we hired a genius—let’s call him Arthur. Usually, new engineers take three months to get fully productive, but Arthur was ready in two days. On his third day, we gave him a project that should take a month. Arthur finished it in three days, almost perfect. He worked nonstop for seventy-two hours straight—no breaks, no sleep, just coding. In his first three months, he was our best employee and we promoted him right away.

Then Arthur changed. He started missing work without telling anyone. Then he missed weeks. When he came back, he apologized a lot, but kept doing the same thing. His work got worse—sloppy and unfocused. I couldn’t understand how such a great employee could mess up so badly. His manager wanted to fire him because the team couldn’t rely on him anymore. I didn’t want to give up. I believed the genius was still there and wanted us to find it. We never did. Arthur was bipolar and had two big drug problems: he didn’t like taking his bipolar medicine and he was addicted to cocaine. In the end, we had to fire Arthur, but it still hurts to think about what could have been.
