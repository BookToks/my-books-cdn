All these ideas just showed me that the problem wasn’t with the market. Customers were buying things; they just weren’t buying our product. This wasn’t the time to change direction. So, I told everyone the same thing: “There are no easy solutions, only tough ones.” They didn’t want to hear that, but it made things clear: We had to make a better product. There was no other way. No shortcuts, no hiding, no escape. We had to face the problem head-on. Tough solutions.

After nine months of hard work on a really strong product, we took the lead again and built a company worth $1.6 billion. Without those tough solutions, I think we would only be worth about one-tenth of that.

Nothing in business is scarier than facing a threat that could end everything. It’s so scary that many people try to avoid it. They look for any other way out or excuse not to face the challenge. I see this a lot with startups. The talks go like this: Entrepreneur: “Our product is the best by far. Customers love it more than competitor X.” Me: “Then why does competitor X make five times more money?” Entrepreneur: “We use partners because we can’t sell directly like competitor X.” Me: “Why not? If your product is better, why not fight for it?” Entrepreneur: “Ummm.” Me: “Stop looking for an easy fix.” Every company has a time when it must fight to survive. If you’re running away when you should be fighting, ask yourself, “If our company isn’t good enough to win, do we even need to exist?”
