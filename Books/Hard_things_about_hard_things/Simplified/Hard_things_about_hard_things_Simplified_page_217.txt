— CHAPTER 9 — THE END OF THE BEGINNING

“We walk the same path, but got on different shoes  
Live in the same building, but we got different views.”  
—DRAKE, “RIGHT ABOVE IT”

After selling Opsware, I spent a year at HP running most of their software business. Then I started thinking about what to do next. Should I start another company? Should I be CEO of someone else’s company? Should I retire?

Should I do something totally different?

The more I thought about my future, the more I thought about my past. What if I had never met Bill Campbell? How would I have handled all the challenges I faced? Why did starting a business seem like such a mystery? Did everyone have the same problems I had? If so, why didn’t anyone write about it? Why did so few startup advisors and investors have real experience starting companies?

While I was thinking about this, I sent Marc Andreessen a quick message: “We should start a venture capital firm. Our rule for partners would be ‘some experience required,’ meaning you need to have started and run companies to help others who are doing the same.” To my surprise, he replied, “I was thinking the same thing.”

SOME EXPERIENCE NECESSARY

Thinking more about this took me back to one of my first real experiences with venture capital.

In 1999, after raising our first round of money for Loudcloud, my cofounders and I went to visit our new venture capital firm and meet their full team.
