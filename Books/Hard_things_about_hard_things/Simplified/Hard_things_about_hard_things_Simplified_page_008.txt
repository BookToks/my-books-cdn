— CHAPTER 1 — FROM COMMUNIST TO VENTURE CAPITALIST

“This here is all about my wife, my kids, the life that I live.  
Through the night, I was his, it was right, but I did  
My ups, and downs, my slips, my falls  
My trials and tribulations, my heart, my balls.”  
—DMX, “WHO WE BE”

The other day, I threw a big barbecue at my house and invited a hundred of my closest friends.  
These kinds of parties aren’t unusual. My brother-in-law, Cartheu, and I have been barbecuing for years, and I’m so good at it that my African American friends call me “the Jackie Robinson of Barbecue.” I broke the color barrier.

At this barbecue, the talk turned to the famous rapper Nas.  

My friend Tristan Walker, a young African American businessman, proudly said that Nas was from his home project, Queensbridge, New York—one of the biggest public housing projects in the U.S.  

My seventy-three-year-old Jewish dad jumped in and said, “I’ve been to Queensbridge.”  

Tristan couldn’t believe it and said, “You must mean Queens. Queensbridge is actually a housing project in a really tough neighborhood.”  

But my dad insisted he meant Queensbridge.  

I told Tristan that my dad grew up in Queens, so he wasn’t mixing things up. Then I asked my dad, “What were you doing in Queensbridge?”  

He said, “I was handing out communist flyers when I was eleven years old. I remember it clearly because my mom got really worried that the Communist Party sent me into the projects. She thought it was too dangerous for a little kid.”
