— CHAPTER 2 — “I WILL SURVIVE”

“Did you think I’d fall apart?  
Did you think I’d give up and die?  
Oh no, not me—I will survive.”  
—GLORIA GAYNOR, “I WILL SURVIVE”

After Netscape’s success, Marc knew all the top investors in Silicon Valley, so we didn’t need any introductions. But Kleiner Perkins, the company that backed Netscape, had already invested in a possible rival. We talked to all the other big firms and decided to work with Andy Rachleff from Benchmark Capital.

If I had to pick one word for Andy, it would be gentleman. He was smart, polite, and very thoughtful. Andy could explain complicated ideas in short, clear sentences. Benchmark agreed to invest $15 million before the company got the cash, and the company was valued at $45 million. Marc put in another $6 million, making the total company value $66 million with the cash included. Marc would be our “full-time chairman of the board.” Tim Howes would be the chief technology officer, and I would be the CEO. Loudcloud was just two months old.

The money and company value showed how things were back then and pushed us to grow fast and beat other well-funded competitors. Andy told me, “Ben, imagine how you’d run the business if money was free.” Two months later, we got another $45 million from Morgan Stanley as a loan, with no rules or payments for three years, so Andy’s idea really made sense.
