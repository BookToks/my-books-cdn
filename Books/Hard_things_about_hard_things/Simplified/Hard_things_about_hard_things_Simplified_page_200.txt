— CHAPTER 8 — FIRST RULE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THERE ARE NO RULES

“That that that that don’t kill me  
Can only make me stronger  
I need you to hurry up now  
’Cause I can’t wait much longer  
I know I got to be right now  
’Cause I can’t get much wronger  
Man I been waitin’ all night now  
That’s how long I been on ya.”  
—KANYE WEST, “STRONGER”

When we were trying to sell Opsware, HP first offered $14 per share. Then BMC offered $14.05. HP responded with $14.25. John O’Farrell and I made a plan to finish the bidding. We thought if we did it right, the winning offer would be $15 per share or more. Everyone was really excited.

Then something bad happened. Our auditor, Ernst & Young, almost ruined the deal.

During BMC’s check of the company, they found that we had counted three deals differently than they did. Each of those deals had something called the “CA clause,” named after a software company called Computer Associates, or CA for short. The CA clause came from some tricky business CA did. CA had fooled customers by selling maintenance contracts that gave them free upgrades forever.
