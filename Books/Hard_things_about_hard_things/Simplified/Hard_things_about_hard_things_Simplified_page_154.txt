Desks made out of doors

A long time ago, Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, wanted to build a company that made money by helping customers, not by taking from them. To do that, he aimed to be the best at both low prices and great customer service for a long time. You can’t do that if you waste a lot of money.

Instead of spending years checking every expense and scolding people who spent too much, Jeff decided to make saving money part of Amazon’s culture. He did this in a simple way: all Amazon desks would be made by buying cheap doors from Home Depot and adding legs to them. These door desks aren’t very comfortable or fancy, especially for such a huge company. But when new employees ask why they have to use these makeshift desks, the answer is always the same: “We try to save money everywhere so we can offer the best products at the lowest prices.” If you don’t like sitting at a door, you probably won’t last long at Amazon.

Ten dollars per minute

When we started Andreessen Horowitz, Marc and I wanted to treat entrepreneurs with a lot of respect. We knew how hard and stressful it is to build a company. We wanted to show we respected that by always being on time for meetings with entrepreneurs. Unlike other venture capitalists who make entrepreneurs wait, we wanted to be on time, ready, and focused.

But staying on time is harder than it sounds. To make sure everyone took it seriously, we created a strict rule: if you’re late to a meeting with an entrepreneur, you have to pay ten dollars for every minute you’re late. So, if you’re ten minutes late, you bring one hundred dollars to the meeting as a fine.

New employees find this surprising, which gives us a chance to explain why we respect entrepreneurs so much. If you don’t think entrepreneurs are more important than venture capitalists, then you won’t fit in at Andreessen Horowitz.
