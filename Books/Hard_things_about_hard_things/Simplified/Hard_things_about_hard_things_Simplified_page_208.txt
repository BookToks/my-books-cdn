After only one week of walking in each other’s shoes, both bosses quickly figured out the main problems causing the fight.  

They then quickly put in some easy steps that stopped the fighting and helped the teams work well together.  

From that day until we sold the company, the Sales Engineering and Customer Support teams worked better together than any other big groups in the company—all because of Freaky Friday, maybe the smartest management training movie ever made.  

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
