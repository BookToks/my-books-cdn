I guess we’re not going to wait until the 5th to launch the strategy.

You don’t seem to get how serious this is. We are getting totally crushed out there. Our product is way worse than the competition. We haven’t said anything useful in months. Because of that, we’ve lost over $3 billion in market value. We might even lose the whole company, and it’s all server product management’s fault.  

Next time, do the damn interview yourself.  

Screw you, Marc.  

I got this email the same day Marc was barefoot and sitting on a throne on the cover of Time magazine. At first, I was super excited. I had never met anyone who was on the cover of Time before.  

Then I felt really sick. I took the magazine and the email home to Felicia to get her opinion. I was really worried. I was twenty-nine, had a wife and three kids, and needed my job. She read the email and saw the magazine cover and said, “You need to start looking for a job right now.”  

In the end, I didn’t get fired, and over the next two years, SuiteSpot grew from nothing to a $400 million a year business. Even more surprising, Marc and I eventually became friends; we’ve been friends and business partners ever since.  

People often ask how we’ve worked well together across three companies for eighteen years. Most business relationships either get too tense to handle or too easy to be useful after a while. Either people argue so much they hate each other, or they stop pushing each other and don’t improve.  

With Marc and me, even after eighteen years, he still annoys me almost every day by pointing out what’s wrong with my ideas, and I do the same to him. And it works.
