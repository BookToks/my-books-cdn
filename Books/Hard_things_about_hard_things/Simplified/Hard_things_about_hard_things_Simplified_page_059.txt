I was the first CEO and really connected to the company. If things went really bad, others could just leave, but I couldn’t. Because of that, the employees dealt with losses much better.

I also made a dumb mistake. I thought it was only my job to worry about the company’s problems. If I had thought more clearly, I would have known it didn’t make sense for me alone to worry about things like the product not being perfect—especially since I wasn’t the one fixing it.

A way better idea would have been to give the problem to the people who could actually fix it and who would be excited and motivated to do so. For example, if we lost a big potential customer, everyone in the company needed to know why. That way, we could all work together to fix what was wrong with our products, marketing, and sales. If I kept all the bad news to myself, it was impossible to start fixing things.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT TO BE HONEST ABOUT PROBLEMS

There are three main reasons why being honest about your company’s problems is smart:

1. Trust.

Without trust, communication breaks down. Basically, the more you trust someone, the less you need to explain things.

Think about it like this: If I trust you completely, I don’t need you to explain what you’re doing because I know you’re acting in my best interest. But if I don’t trust you, no amount of talking or explaining will convince me because I won’t believe you.

In a company, this is very important. As a company grows, communication gets harder. If employees trust the CEO, communication is way easier. Being honest about what’s really going on helps build that trust. A CEO’s ability to build trust often decides if a company works well or is a mess.

2. The more people thinking about hard problems, the better.
