Just like you did when you updated the board, keep your message positive and don’t blame the executive. The best workers are probably the ones who work closely with her. If you badmouth her, those good employees will think they might be next. Is that the message you want to send?

When you tell the company what’s going on, you might worry that employees will misunderstand and think the company is in trouble. Don’t try to avoid this reaction. When you treat your employees like adults, they usually act like adults. But if you treat them like kids, your company will feel like a big kids' show.

IN THE END, every CEO likes to say they run a great company. It’s hard to know if that’s true until the company or the CEO faces something really tough.

Firing an executive is a good way to test that.
