DEDICATION This is for Felicia, Sophia, Mariah, and the Boocher, my family, for putting up with me while I was learning all of this.

All the money I make from this book will go to help women in poor countries get basic rights through the American Jewish World Service. They really deal with tough stuff.

My name is Sandeep Gautam
