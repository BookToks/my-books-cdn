MANAGEMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE

Everyone in the tech world agrees that people are the most important. But no one agrees on what the human resources (HR) team should actually be like.

The problem is that most CEOs don’t really know what they want from HR. They want a company that’s well-run and has a great culture.

They kind of know that HR alone can’t make that happen. So, CEOs usually just pick something okay or even useless.

Funny enough, when you manage an engineering team, you learn that quality assurance (QA) can’t build a great product, but QA can tell you if the product is bad. The same goes for HR. A good HR team can’t make your company perfect, but it can tell you when your managers aren’t doing a good job.

THE EMPLOYEE LIFE CYCLE

The best way to check how good management is, is by looking at the employee life cycle. From when someone is hired to when they retire, how good is your company? Is your management team great at every step? How do you know?

A strong HR team will support, measure, and help make your management better. Some questions they help answer are: Recruiting and Hiring

Do you really understand what skills and talents are needed for every job?

Are your interviewers ready and prepared?

Do your managers and employees do a good job convincing new people to join your company?

Do interviewers show up on time?
