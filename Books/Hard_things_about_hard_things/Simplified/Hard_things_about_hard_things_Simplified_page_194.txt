HOW TO EVALUATE CEOs

No job in a company is more important than the CEO, so they get watched very closely. The job isn’t clearly defined, so sometimes CEOs end up doing strange things, especially if they listen to people who say things like “the CEO should be the number-one salesperson.”

Unfortunately, most of the talks about CEOs happen without them knowing. I want to change that by explaining how I judge CEOs. This also shows what I think a CEO’s job really is. Here are the main questions we ask:

1. Does the CEO know what to do?

2. Can the CEO get the company to do what she knows?

3. Did the CEO reach the goals set for the company?

1. DOES THE CEO KNOW WHAT TO DO?

This question should be understood in a very broad way. Does the CEO know what to do in all situations, all the time? This means handling staff, money, product plans, setting goals, and marketing. At a big-picture level, does the CEO create the right plan for the company and understand how it affects every part of the business?

I look at two parts of knowing what to do:

Strategy: In good companies, the story and the strategy are the same. So, the main result of all the strategy work is the story the company tells.

Decision making: On a detailed level, knowing what to do shows in how fast and well the CEO makes decisions.
