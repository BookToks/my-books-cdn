Make sure new executives start producing results right away. Everyone in the company will be watching, and this is very important for them to fit in.

They need to really understand the product, technology, customers, and market. Executives who don’t know these things aren’t useful in startups. Make your new executive learn all this.

Try having a daily meeting with the new executive. Make them bring a list of questions about anything they didn’t fully understand that day. Answer their questions in detail, starting from the basics. Help them catch up quickly. If they don’t have any questions, think about firing them. If after 30 days they still aren’t getting up to speed, definitely fire them.

Get them involved with others. Make sure they reach out and talk to their coworkers and important people in the company. Give them a list of people to meet and learn from. Afterward, ask them to report what they learned from each person.

FINAL THOUGHTS Hiring someone who has experience building a similar company on a bigger scale can really speed up your company’s growth. But it can also be risky. So, watch closely for signs of success or failure.
