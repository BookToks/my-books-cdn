ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

First and most important, I want to thank my amazing wife of twenty-five years, Felicia Horowitz. It feels a bit strange to thank her because she has been such a big part of this story that she should really be called a coauthor. She has always been my biggest supporter, and her belief in me and this book has meant everything. There wouldn’t be a book without her, and I wouldn’t be who I am without her. She is my partner in life and the love of my life, and I owe her everything I have and everything I am. I don’t have the right words to show how grateful I am. Felicia, I love you and thank you.

I am also really thankful to all the people who helped me through the tough times and to those who helped me explain what those times were like.

I hope this book can give back some of that help.

Next, I want to thank my mom, Elissa Horowitz. She always encouraged me to go after whatever I wanted to do—from playing football to writing this book. She believed in me when no one else did and understood me like no one else ever could. Thanks, Mom!

I also want to thank my dad, David, who convinced me that writing this book was a good idea and then spent a lot of time helping me edit it.

None of this would have happened without my longtime business partner, Marc Andreessen. He saw things in me that nobody else did. It’s been amazing to work with him for the past eighteen years. He has inspired me in everything I do. He was the main editor of the first dozen blog posts I wrote and helped a lot with editing this book. It’s a real honor to work with someone as great as him every day.

I thank my friend Bill Campbell for teaching me so much about how to get through hard times. Very few people went through what he did, and almost nobody is willing to talk about it. Bill, thank you for being honest and brave.

Michael Ovitz helped me rewrite the ending of the book and made it way better. Before that, he did everything he could to support me in my impossible journey—even buying Opsware stock when nobody else would. He
