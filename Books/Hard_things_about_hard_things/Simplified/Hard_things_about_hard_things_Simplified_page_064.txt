STEP 6: BE VISIBLE, BE PRESENT

After you give the speech saying you will be letting many people go, you might not want to hang out or talk to anyone. You might feel like going to a bar and drinking a lot of tequila. Donâ€™t do that.

Be there. Show up. Be friendly. People want to see you and know if you care. Those you laid off will want to know if they still have a connection with you and the company. Talk to them. Help them carry their stuff to their cars. Let them know you appreciate what they did.
