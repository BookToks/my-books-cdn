If anyone got stuck on something for any reason, it couldn’t last more than twenty-four hours—the time between meetings.

Meanwhile, Anthony worked hard to find something exciting we could offer EDS. We started with small things that didn’t change much, but gave us important clues. We flew our main EDS executive, Frank, out to meet with our top engineers and architects. When Anthony booked the trip, he said Frank wanted the longest layover possible in the connecting airport. I thought I heard wrong. “What, he wants a long layover?” Anthony said, “Yep.” I asked, “Why would anyone want a long layover in an airport?” Anthony said, “Apparently, he likes to hang out in the airport bar between flights.” I asked, “Why does he like to do that?” Anthony said, “I asked him the same thing. Frank said, ‘Because I hate my job and I hate my family.’” Wow. I didn’t know who I was dealing with until then. Understanding how Frank saw things so differently from the people at Opsware helped me understand better. Frank expected to get tricked by us. That’s what always happened to him at work and maybe at home too. We needed something big to change how he thought. We needed him to think about the airport bar, not his job or family.

At the same time, Jason led the team through the deployment with exact focus. A month into the plan, the Southwest Airlines crew working the San Jose–Dallas flight knew Jason and his team by name. They made steady progress, but it wasn’t enough. We wouldn’t get EDS fully done in sixty days—so now we really needed Anthony to find something exciting.

As I sat in my office hoping for a breakthrough, my cell phone rang. It was Anthony.

Anthony said, “Ben, I think I’ve got it.” I asked, “Got what?” He said, “The exciting value is Tangram.” I asked, “What?” Anthony said, “Tangram. EDS uses a product from a company called Tangram that keeps track of their hardware and software. Frank really loves it, but the buying team will make him switch to a product from Computer Associates because it’s free as part of EDS’s deal with CA. Frank hates the CA product. Frank is getting tricked again.”
