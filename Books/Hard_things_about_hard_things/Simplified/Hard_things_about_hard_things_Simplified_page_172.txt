Don’t look at the wall; look at the road. If you stare at the wall, you’ll crash into it. But if you keep your eyes on the road, you’ll stay on track. Running a company is just like that. There are always lots of problems that can mess things up. If you focus too much on those problems, you’ll stress out and probably mess up your company. Pay attention to where you’re going, not what you’re trying to avoid.

DON’T GIVE UP AND DON’T BACK DOWN. As a CEO, you’ll often feel like quitting. I’ve seen CEOs handle stress by drinking too much, checking out, or just quitting altogether.

Each of them has a good excuse for why quitting was okay, but none of them became great CEOs.

Great CEOs face the hard times. They handle sleepless nights, worry, and what my friend Alfred Chuang calls “the torture.” When I ask successful CEOs how they made it, average ones talk about smart plans or good instincts. But great CEOs give a simple answer.

They all say, “I didn’t quit.”
