HOW TO SPOT IF THE FIT IS WRONG

How can you tell if someone won’t fit in because they work at a different speed or don’t have the right skills? Here are some interview questions that helped me:

What will you do in your first month on the job?

Be careful if they spend too much time saying they need to learn a lot. This might mean they think your company is more complicated than it really is. They might believe your company is as complex as where they work now.

Watch out if they seem like they need people to tell them what to do all the time. At your company, you won’t always get interruptions to guide you.

Look for people who want to start lots of new projects right away. That’s a good sign.

How will your new job be different from your current job?

Look for people who understand the differences clearly. If they have the right experience, they can explain this well.

Be careful if they think most of their experience applies perfectly right away. It might help later, but probably not immediately.

Why do you want to join a small company?

Be cautious if their main reason is to get stock or shares. A tiny part of nothing is still nothing. Big company leaders sometimes don’t get this.

It’s better if they want to be more creative. The biggest difference between big and small companies is that small ones spend more time making things happen instead of just running things. Wanting to create more is the right reason to join your company.

HELP THEM FIT IN QUICKLY

One of the most important things is to help the new person fit in fast. You should spend a lot of time helping any new leader get comfortable. Here are some tips:

Make sure they start creating right away. Give them goals to work on every month, week, and even day.
