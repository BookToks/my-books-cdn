Taking risks can be dangerous, but sometimes the reward isn’t worth it. If someone didn’t get the result they wanted, did they take really bad risks they didn’t think through, or were the risks smart but just didn’t work out?

Let’s think about the problem from the start. First, how experienced is she? If she’s the main architect, she needs to get better at planning her work or she could mess things up. If she’s less experienced, this should be a chance to teach her, not just blame her.

Second, how hard was the project? If it was amazing that the project even worked at all, don’t get mad—actually, thank her. But if it was an easy project that just took too long, then you need to fix that.

Third, was the risk the right one to take? Would the product really have stopped working well soon? If yes, then whether it took three months or nine months, it was still the right choice. You shouldn’t stress about it or change what you did.

In tech, you almost never know everything from the start. The difference between being okay and being awesome is often about letting people try creative things and not holding them too tightly accountable.

Being responsible is important, but it’s not the only thing that matters.
