Sometimes, people keep doing their old job instead of moving on to their new one.

But what about being loyal to the team that helped you get to where you are now? If your current executive team helped you grow your company a lot, can you just ignore them if they struggle to manage the big company they built? The answer is that your loyalty should be to your employeesâ€”the people who work under your executives. Your engineers, marketing team, salespeople, and finance and HR staff who actually do the work. They deserve the best management team possible.

That should be your main focus.
