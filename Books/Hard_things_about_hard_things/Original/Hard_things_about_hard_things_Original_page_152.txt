PROGRAMMING YOUR CULTURE Ask ten founders about company culture and what it means and you’ll get ten different answers. It’s about office design, it’s about screening out the wrong kinds of employees, it’s about values, it’s about fun, it’s about alignment, it’s about finding like-minded employees, it’s about being cultlike.
 
 So what is culture? Does culture matter? If so, how much time should you spend on it?
 
 Let’s start with the second question first. The primary thing that any technology startup must do is build a product that’s at least ten times better at doing something than the current prevailing way of doing that thing. Two or three times better will not be good enough to get people to switch to the new thing fast enough or in large enough volume to matter. The second thing that any technology startup must do is to take the market. If it’s possible to do something ten times better, it’s also possible that you won’t be the only company to figure that out. Therefore, you must take the market before somebody else does. Very few products are ten times better than the competition’s, so unseating the new incumbent is much more difficult than unseating the old one.
 
 If you fail to do both of those things, your culture won’t matter one bit. The world is full of bankrupt companies with world-class cultures. Culture does not make a company.
 
 So, why bother with culture at all? Three reasons: 1. It matters to the extent that it can help you achieve the above goals.
 
 2. As your company grows, culture can help you preserve your key values, make your company a better place to work, and help it perform better in the future.
 
 3. Perhaps most important, after you and your people go through the inhuman amount of work that it will take to build a successful company, it will be an epic tragedy if your company culture is such that even you don’t want to work there.
