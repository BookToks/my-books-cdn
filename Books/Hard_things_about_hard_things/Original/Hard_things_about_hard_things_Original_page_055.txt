THE STRUGGLE Every entrepreneur starts her company with a clear vision for success. You will create an amazing environment and hire the smartest people to join you.
 
 Together you will build a beautiful product that delights customers and makes the world just a little bit better. It’s going to be absolutely awesome.
 
 Then, after working night and day to make your vision a reality, you wake up to find that things did not go as planned. Your company did not unfold like the Jack Dorsey keynote that you listened to when you started. Your product has issues that will be very hard to fix. The market isn’t quite where it was supposed to be. Your employees are losing confidence and some of them have quit. Some of the ones who quit were quite smart and have the remaining ones wondering if staying makes sense. You are running low on cash and your venture capitalist tells you that it will be difficult to raise money given the impending European economic catastrophe. You lose a competitive battle. You lose a loyal customer.
 
 You lose a great employee. The walls start closing in. Where did you go wrong?
 
 Why didn’t your company perform as envisioned? Are you good enough to do this? As your dreams turn into nightmares, you find yourself in the Struggle.
