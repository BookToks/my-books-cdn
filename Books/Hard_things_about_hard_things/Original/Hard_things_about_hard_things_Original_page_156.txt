TAKING THE MYSTERY OUT OF SCALING A COMPANY If you want to build an important company, then at some point you have to scale.
 
 People in startup land often talk about the magic of how few people built the original Google or the original Facebook, but today’s Google employs twenty thousand people and today’s Facebook employs more than fifteen hundred people. So, if you want to do something that matters, then you are going to have to learn the black art of scaling a human organization.
 
 Often board members give entrepreneurs two bits of advice regarding scale: 1. Get a mentor.
 
 2. Find some “been there, done that” executives who already know how to scale.
 
 These answers, while fine as far as they go, have some important limitations.
 
 First, if you don’t know anything about scaling an organization, then it will be very difficult for you to evaluate people for that job. Imagine trying to find a killer engineer if you’d never written a single program. Second, many investorboard members don’t know anything about scaling a company, either, and can be suckers for people who have the experience but not the skills. If you’ve ever worked in a large organization, you know that there are plenty of people with experience running them but none of the requisite skills to run them well.
 
 This advice is still good, but the right way to pick both the best mentors and best employees is by first learning the basics; then you can apply the myriad of scaling techniques in the management literature depending on the context.
