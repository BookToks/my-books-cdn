I thank all the partners and employees at Andreessen Horowitz who put up with my grouchiness and increased profanity as I wrote this. It would not have been possible without you. Thank you for making the dream of a firm for founding CEOs come true.
 
 A special thank-you to Margit Wennmachers for believing that I had something to say and helping me find people who would hear it. I am so lucky to be working in the presence of such greatness.
 
 Grace Ellis has been by my side throughout the process, handling every weird detail that one could imagine. During this time, I have yet to hear her complain about a single thing. Beyond that, she has given me great advice and been a great friend.
 
 Thank you, Ken Coleman, for giving me my first job and being a fantastic mentor for nearly thirty years.
 
 Thanks to my brother in-law, Cartheu Jordan Jr., for being an important character in this book and in my life. He is Branch Rickey to my Jackie Robinson.
 
 Thank you, John and Loretta Wiley, for being so supportive of me in everything that I do.
 
 Thanks to my brothers and sisters Jonathan Daniel, Anne Rishon, and Sarah Horowitz for shaping me. Love you always, Sarah.
 
 I thank the late, great Mike Homer for his wisdom, help, and love. I thank Andy Rachleff for being a great gentleman and friend. Thank you, Sy Lorne, for keeping me out of trouble. Thank you, Mike Volpi, for being on the board of a very scary company.
 
 Finally, thank you, Boochie, Red, and Boogie, for being the best children that I could imagine.
