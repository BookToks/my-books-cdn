HOW TO EVALUATE CEOs No position in a company is more important than the CEO and, as a result, no job gets more scrutiny. The job is so poorly defined that you can end up doing all kinds of nutty things (especially if you listen to some people who say things like “the CEO should be the number-one salesperson”).
 
 Sadly, little of this analysis that’s been done benefits CEOs, since most of the discussions happen behind their backs. Here I want to take a step in the opposite direction. By describing how I evaluate CEOs, I am at the same time describing what I think the job of the CEO is. Here are the key questions we ask: 1. Does the CEO know what to do?
 
 2. Can the CEO get the company to do what she knows?
 
 3. Did the CEO achieve the desired results against an appropriate set of objectives?
 
 1. DOES THE CEO KNOW WHAT TO DO?
 
 One should interpret this question as broadly as possible. Does the CEO know what to do in all matters all the time? This includes matters of personnel, financing, product strategy, goal sizing, and marketing. At a macro level, does the CEO set the right strategy for the company and know its implications in every detail of the company?
 
 I evaluate two distinct facets of knowing what to do: Strategy In good companies, the story and the strategy are the same thing. As a result, the proper output of all the strategic work is the story.
 
 Decision making At the detailed level, the output of knowing what to do is the speed and quality of the CEO’s decisions.
