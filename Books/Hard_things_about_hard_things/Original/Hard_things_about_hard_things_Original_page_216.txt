with my husband and two kids and it’s that or divorce.” Be clear with the company. One question that every startup CEO gets from her employees is “Are you selling the company?” This is an incredibly difficult question. If she says nothing, the employee will likely interpret this to mean the company is for sale. If she says “at the right price,” the employee will wonder what that price is and may even ask. If the company ever reaches that price, the employee will assume the company will be sold.
 
 If she dodges the question with the standard “the company is not for sale,” the employee may feel betrayed if the company is ever sold. More important, the CEO may feel like she is betraying the employee and that feeling will influence her decision-making process. One way to avoid these traps is to describe the analysis in the prior section: If the company achieves product-market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be number one, then the company will likely remain independent. If not, it will likely be sold. This is one good method to describe the interests of the investors in a way that’s not at odds with the interests of the employees, and it is true.
 
 FINAL THOUGHT When faced with the decision of whether to sell your company, there is no easy answer. However, preparing yourself intellectually and emotionally will help.
