DEDICATION This is for Felicia, Sophia, Mariah, and the Boocher, mi familia, for putting up with me when I was learning all of this.
 
 One hundred percent of my portion of the proceeds of this book will go to help women in developing countries gain basic civil rights via the American Jewish World Service. They truly face the hard things.
