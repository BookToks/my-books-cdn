LEAD BULLETS Early in my tenure at Netscape, when we realized that Microsoft’s new Web server had every feature that ours had, but was also five times faster and was to be given away for free, I immediately went to work trying to pivot our server product line to something that we could sell for money. The late, great Mike Homer and I worked furiously on a set of partnerships and acquisitions that would broaden the product line and surround the Web server with enough functionality that we would be able to survive the attack.
 
 I excitedly reviewed the plan with my engineering counterpart, Bill Turpin, who looked at me as though I were a little kid who had much to learn. Bill was a longtime veteran of battling Microsoft from his time at Borland and understood what I was trying to do, but he was not persuaded. He said, “Ben, those silver bullets that you and Mike are looking for are fine and good, but our Web server is five times slower. There is no silver bullet that’s going to fix that. No, we are going to have to use a lot of lead bullets.” Oh snap.
 
 As a result of Bill’s advice, we focused our engineering team on fixing the performance issues while working on the other things in the background. We eventually beat Microsoft’s performance and grew the server line to become a $400 million business, and we would never have done it without those lead bullets.
 
 I carried that lesson with me for many years. Six years later, when I was CEO of Opsware, our toughest competitor, BladeLogic, started to consistently beat us in large deals. We were a public company, and the losses were all too visible. To make matters worse, we needed to win those deals in order to beat Wall Street’s projections, so the company felt tremendous pressure. Many of our smartest people came to me with ideas for avoiding the battle: “Let’s build a lightweight version of the product and go down-market.” “Let’s acquire a company with a simpler architecture.” “Let’s focus on service providers.”
