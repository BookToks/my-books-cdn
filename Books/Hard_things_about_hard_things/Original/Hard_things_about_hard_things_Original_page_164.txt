— CHAPTER 7 — HOW TO LEAD EVEN WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING “This for every ghetto in the hood Nas the Don, Super Cat the Don Dada, understood.” —NAS, “THE DON” A fter selling the Loudcloud business to EDS, we immediately plunged into a new crisis. Our investors could not understand how selling all of our revenue and all of our customers could possibly leave us with anything worth investing in. As a result, institutional investors sold all of their Opsware shares, and our stock price fell to $0.35 per share. This turned out to be a noteworthy price, because it computed to a market capitalization equal to half of the cash we had in the bank.
 
 This signaled that investors believed that the Opsware business had no value, and they further expected us to burn up half our cash before coming to our senses and returning the cash to investors. To make matters more miserable, I received a notice from NASDAQ informing me that if I did not get our stock price above $1 within the next ninety days, they would delist us and we would trade with the penny stocks.
 
 I brought this cheery news to the board with three options: 1. Reverse split. We could reverse split the stock 10:1 and have ten times fewer shares and a ten times higher stock price.
 
 2. Give in. We could become a penny stock.
 
 3. Hit the road. I could go on the road and try to get enough people to buy so that the stock price would triple.
 
 The board was extremely sympathetic and open to every option. Andy
