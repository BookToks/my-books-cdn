driven.
 
 In contrast, when you are a startup executive, nothing happens unless you make it happen. In the early days of a company, you have to take eight to ten new initiatives a day or the company will stand still. There is no inertia that’s putting the company in motion. Without massive input from you, the company will stay at rest.
 
 SO WHAT HAPPENS?
 
 Once you hire one of these big company executives, there are two dangerous mismatches that you will face: 1. Rhythm mismatch Your executive has been conditioned to wait for the emails to come in, wait for the phone to ring, and wait for the meetings to get scheduled. In your company, he will be waiting a long time. If your new executive waits (as per his training), your other employees will become suspicious. You’ll hear things like “What does that guy do all day long?” and “Why did he get so many options?” 2. Skill set mismatch Running a large organization requires very different skills than creating and building an organization. When you run a large organization, you tend to become very good at tasks such as complex decision-making, prioritization, organizational design, process improvement, and organizational communication. When you are building an organization, there is no organization to design, there are no processes to improve, and communicating with the organization is simple. On the other hand, you have to be very adept at running a high-quality hiring process, have terrific domain expertise (you are personally responsible for quality control), know how to create process from scratch, and be extremely creative about initiating new directions and tasks.
 
 HOW CAN YOU STOP THINGS FROM GOING HORRIBLY WRONG?
 
 There are two key steps to avoiding disaster: 1. Screen for devastating mismatches in the interview process.
 
 2. Take integration as seriously as interviewing.
