CEO really want us to break things? I mean, he’s telling us to break things! A motto that shocking forces everyone to stop and think. When they think, they realize that if you move fast and innovate, you will break things. If you ask yourself, “Should I attempt this breakthrough? It will be awesome, but it may cause problems in the short term,” you have your answer. If you’d rather be right than innovative, you won’t fit in at Facebook.
 
 Prior to figuring out the exact form of your company’s shock therapy, be sure that your mechanism agrees with your values. For example, Jack Dorsey will never make his own desks out of doors at Square because at Square, beautiful design trumps frugality. When you walk into Square, you can feel how seriously they take design.
 
 WHY DOGS AT WORK AND YOGA AREN’T CULTURE Startups today do all kinds of things to distinguish themselves. Many great, many original, many quirky, but most of them will not define the company’s culture. Yes, yoga may make your company a better place to work for people who like yoga. It may also be a great team-building exercise for people who like yoga. Nonetheless, it’s not culture. It will not establish a core value that drives the business and helps promote it in perpetuity. It is not specific with respect to what your business aims to achieve. Yoga is a perk.
 
 Somebody keeping a pit bull in her cube may be shocking. The lesson learned —that animal lovers are welcome or that employees can live however they want —may provide some societal value, but it does not connect to your business in a distinguishing way. Every smart company values its employees. Perks are good, but they are not culture.
 
 THE POINT OF IT ALL In the later section “How to Evaluate CEOs” (see page 235), I describe the CEO job as knowing what to do and getting the company to do what you want.
 
 Designing a proper company culture will help you get your company to do what you want in certain important areas for a very long time.
