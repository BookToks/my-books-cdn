way, profanity is no different from other language. For example, consider the word ‘cupcakes.’ It’s fine for me to say to Shannon, ‘Those cupcakes you baked look delicious.’ But it is not okay for me to say to Anthony, ‘Hey, Cupcakes, you look mighty fine in them jeans.’ ” And that was all I said about that.
 
 After that day, I never heard another complaint about profanity and I don’t think we lost anybody because of the policy. Sometimes an organization doesn’t need a solution; it just needs clarity. Once I made it clear that cursing was okay —so long as it wasn’t used to intimidate or harass—nobody had a problem with it anymore. At least as far as I knew. Bottom line, the results of the policy were good: a comfortable work environment, low attrition, and no complaining.
 
 Sometimes the right policy is the one that the CEO can follow.
 
 As a company grows, it will change. No matter how well you set your culture, keep your spirit, or slow-roll your growth, your company won’t be the same when it’s one thousand people as it was when it was ten people. But that doesn’t mean that it can’t be a good company when it reaches 1,000, 10,000, or even 100,000 employees. It will just be different. Making it good at scale means admitting that it must be different and embracing the changes that you’ll need to make to keep things from falling apart. This chapter explains some of the changes that you will need to make.
