As you did when you updated the board, keep the message positive and refrain from throwing the executive under the bus. The best employees in the organization will likely be the ones closest to the executive. If you trash her, you will put all her best employees on notice that they are next. Is that a message you want to send?
 
 When you update the company, you might worry about employees misinterpreting the news and thinking the company is in trouble. Do not try to maneuver around such a reaction. When you expect your employees to act like adults, they generally do. If you treat them like children, then get ready for your company to turn into one big Barney episode.
 
 IN THE END Every CEO likes to say she runs a great company. Itâ€™s hard to tell whether the claim is true until the company or the CEO has to do something really difficult.
 
 Firing an executive is a good test.
