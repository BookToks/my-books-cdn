the meeting, since it’s the employee’s meeting, the manager should do 10 percent of the talking and 90 percent of the listening. Note that this is the opposite of most one-on-ones.
 
 While it’s not the manager’s job to set the agenda or do the talking, the manager should try to draw the key issues out of the employee. The more introverted the employee, the more important this becomes. If you manage engineers, drawing out issues will be an important skill to master.
 
 Some questions that I’ve found to be very effective in one-on-ones: If we could improve in any way, how would we do it?
 
 What’s the number-one problem with our organization? Why?
 
 What’s not fun about working here?
 
 Who is really kicking ass in the company? Whom do you admire?
 
 If you were me, what changes would you make?
 
 What don’t you like about the product?
 
 What’s the biggest opportunity that we’re missing out on?
 
 What are we not doing that we should be doing?
 
 Are you happy working here?
 
 In the end, the most important thing is that the best ideas, the biggest problems, and the most intense employee life issues make their way to the people who can deal with them. One-on-ones are a time-tested way to do that, but if you have a better one, go ahead with your bad self.
