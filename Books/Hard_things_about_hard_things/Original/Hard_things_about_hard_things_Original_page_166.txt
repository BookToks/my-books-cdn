meant, as many in Silicon Valley would mean, “Screw off, I’m not buying a penny stock” or if he meant what he’d said. I soon found out.
 
 Over the next couple of months, Allen & Company bought Opsware stock, Herb Allen personally bought Opsware stock, and several Allen & Company clients became major investors. This activity propelled the stock from $0.35 to $3 per share in a matter of months. We’d avoided delisting, rebuilt the shareholder base, and given employees hope. Everything was largely due to a single meeting with Herb Allen.
 
 Years later I asked Herb why he believed in our company at a time when nobody else did. I pointed out that, at the time, Allen & Company wasn’t very involved in technology, let alone data center automation. Herb replied, “I didn’t understand anything about your business and I understood very little about your industry. What I saw was two guys come visit me when every other public company CEO and chairman was hiding under their desk. Not only did you come see me, but you were more determined and convinced you would succeed than guys running giant businesses. Investing in courage and determination was an easy decision for me.” That’s how Herb Allen does business. And that’s why, if given the chance, you’d be a fool not to do business with Herb.

This section encapsulates the various parts of those lessons and provides guidance on how to get the important things right.
