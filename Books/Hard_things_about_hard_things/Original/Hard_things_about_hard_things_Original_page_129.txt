HOW TO MINIMIZE POLITICS IN YOUR COMPANY In all my years in business, I have yet to hear someone say, “I love corporate politics.” On the other hand, I meet plenty of people who complain bitterly about corporate politics—sometimes even in the companies they run.

 HOW IT HAPPENS A CEO creates politics by encouraging and sometimes incentivizing political behavior—often unintentionally. As a very simple example, let’s consider executive compensation.
