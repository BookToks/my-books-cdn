not number one or two.” Wartime CEO often has no businesses that are number one or two and therefore does not have the luxury of following that rule.
 
 CAN A CEO BE BOTH?
 
 Can a CEO build the skill sets to lead in both peacetime and wartime?
 
 One could easily argue that I failed as a peacetime CEO but succeeded as a wartime one. John Chambers had a great run as peacetime CEO of Cisco but has struggled as Cisco has moved into war with Juniper, HP, and a range of new competitors. Steve Jobs, who employed a classical wartime management style, removed himself as CEO of Apple in the 1980s during their longest period of peace before coming back to Apple for a spectacular run more than a decade later, during their most intense war period.
 
 I believe that the answer is yes, but it’s hard. Mastering both wartime and peacetime skill sets means understanding the many rules of management and knowing when to follow them and when to violate them.
 
 Be aware that management books tend to be written by management consultants who study successful companies during their times of peace. As a result, the resulting books describe the methods of peacetime CEOs. In fact, other than the books written by Andy Grove, I don’t know of any management books that teach you how to manage in wartime like Steve Jobs or Andy Grove.
 
 BACK TO THE BEGINNING It turned out that a little wartime was just what the doctor ordered for Google.
 
 Page’s precise and exacting leadership has led to brilliant execution in integrating identity across Google’s broad product line, from the rise of Android to brilliant new products like Google Glass. Sometimes you need to go to war.
