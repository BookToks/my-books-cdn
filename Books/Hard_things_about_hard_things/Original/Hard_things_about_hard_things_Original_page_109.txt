STEP 2. RUN A PROCESS THAT FIGURES OUT THE RIGHT MATCH In order to find the right executive, you must now take the knowledge that you have gathered and translate it into a process that yields the right candidate. Here is the process that I like to use.
 
 Write down the strengths you want and the weaknesses that you are willing to tolerate.
 
 In order to ensure completeness, I find it useful to include criteria from the following subdivisions when hiring executives: Will the executive be world-class at running the function?
 
 Is the executive outstanding operationally?
 
 Will the executive make a major contribution to the strategic direction of the company? This is the “are they smart enough?” criterion.
 
 Will the executive be an effective member of the team? Effective is the key word. It’s possible for an executive to be well liked and totally ineffective with respect to the other members of the team. It’s also possible for an executive to be highly effective and profoundly influential while being totally despised. The latter is far better.
 
 These functions do not carry equal weight for all positions. Make sure that you balance them appropriately. Generally, operational excellence is far more important for a VP of engineering or a VP of sales than for a VP of marketing or a CFO.
 
 Develop questions that test for the criteria (see the appendix).
 
 This effort is important even if you never ask the candidate any of the preprepared questions. By writing down questions that test for what you want, you will get to a level of specificity that will be extremely difficult to achieve otherwise. (See the appendix for an example of questions that I wrote for running the enterprise sales function and operational excellence.) Assemble an appropriate interview team and conduct the interviews.
 
 Assemble the interview team.
