People who usually didn’t drink alcohol thought it was okay to drink a lot during Christmas week. There was a lot of loud fun, and many used guns, pistols, and firecrackers. It seemed like they forgot how special the season really is.

During my first Christmas break, I traveled far from town to visit people living on a big farm. It was sad to see how poor and uneducated they were, and how hard they tried to enjoy a holiday that is very important and special in most places.

In one small house, I saw that the five kids only had some firecrackers to remind them of Christmas, and they had to share them. In another house with six people, they only had ten cents’ worth of ginger cakes they bought the day before. Another family had just a few pieces of sugarcane. In one more home, I found only a new jug of cheap whiskey, which the husband and wife were drinking a lot, even though the husband was a local church minister.
