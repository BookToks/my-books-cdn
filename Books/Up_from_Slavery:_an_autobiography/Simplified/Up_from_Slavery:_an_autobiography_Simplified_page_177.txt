Persons who at other times did not use strong drink thought it quite the proper thing to indulge in it rather freely during the Christmas week. There was awidespread hilarity, and a free use of guns, pistols, and gunpowder generally. The sacredness of theseasonseemed to have been almostwhollylostsight of.
 
 During this first Christmas vacation I wentsome distance from the town tovisit the peopleon one of the large plantations. In their poverty and ignorance itwas pathetic to see their attempts to getjoy out of the season thatinmost parts of the country is so sacred and so dearto the heart. In one cabin I noticed that all that the five children had to remind them ofthe coming of Christwas a single bunch offirecrackers, which they haddivided among them. In another cabin, where there were at least a half-dozen persons, they had only ten cents' worthofginger-cakes,which had been bought in the store the day before. In another family they had only a few pieces of sugarcane. In still another cabin I found nothing but a newjug of cheap, meanwhiskey, which the husband andwife were making free use of, notwithstanding the fact ANXIOUS DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS 135 that the husband was one of the local ministers.
