I remember that one morning, not long ago, I wentwith the ladyprincipal on her usual morning tourofinspectionofthe girls' rooms.
 
 We found oneroomthat contained three girlswho had recentlyarrivedat the school. When I asked them if they had tooth-brushes, one of the girls replied, pointing to a brush: "Yes, sir. That is our brush. We bought ittogether,yesterday," It did nottake them longtolearn adifferentlesson.
 
 Ithasbeeninteresting to notethe effectthat the use of thetooth-brush has had in bringing about ahigher degree ofcivilization among the students.
 
 With fewexceptions, I have noticedthat, ifwecan get a student to the pointwhere, when the first or second tooth-brush disappears,he ofhis own motion buys another, I have not been disappointed inthe future of that individual. Absolute cleanliness of the bodyhas been insistedupon fromthe first. The students have been taught to bathe as regularly as to take their meals. This lesson we began teaching beforewe had anything inthe shapeofa bath-house.
 
 Most ofthe students came from plantationdistricts, and often we had to teach them how to sleep at night; that is, whether between the two sheets after we got to the point where we could provide them two sheetsâ€”or underboth of them. Naturally I found it difficult to teach them to sleep 176 UP FROM SLAVERY between two sheets when we were able to supply but one.
