I remember one morning, not long ago, I went with the lady principal on her usual morning check of the girls' rooms.

We found one room with three girls who had just arrived at the school. When I asked if they had toothbrushes, one girl pointed to a brush and said, "Yes, sir. That is our brush. We bought it together yesterday." They learned a new lesson pretty quickly.

It has been interesting to see how using toothbrushes has helped the students become more civilized.

Most of the time, I noticed that if a student buys another toothbrush on their own after the first or second one is gone, I believe they have a good future. We have always made sure the students keep their bodies very clean. They were taught to bathe as often as they eat. We started teaching this before we even had a proper bathhouse.

Most students came from plantation areas, and sometimes we even had to teach them how to sleep at night. This meant whether to sleep between two sheets after we could give them two sheetsâ€”or under both sheets. It was hard to teach them to sleep between two sheets when we could only give them one.
