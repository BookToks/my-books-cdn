In our industrial teaching, we focus on three main goals. First, we want to teach students so they can handle the real-life situations they face now, especially in the part of the South where they live. In short, we want them to be able to do the work the world needs done. 

Second, every student who finishes school should have enough skill, intelligence, and good character to support themselves and others. Third, we want every graduate to feel proud of hard work and to love working instead of trying to avoid it.

Besides teaching young men about farming, we also teach girls the usual household skills. Now, we also train many girls each year in farming.

These girls learn about gardening, growing fruit, taking care of dairy animals, beekeeping, and raising chickens.

Our school is not connected to any church, but we have a special part called the Phelps Hall Bible Training School. Here, some students prepare to become ministers or do other Christian work, especially in rural areas. 

An important part of this training is that each student spends half of their day working in the community.
