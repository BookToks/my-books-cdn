While I was waiting, I saw her letting other students in, and that made me feel really uncomfortable. Deep down, I believed I could do just as well as they could if I only got a chance to show what I could do.

After a few hours, the head teacher told me, "The next room needs sweeping. Take the broom and sweep it." I felt right away that this was my chance. I had never been happier to get an order. I knew I could sweep because Mrs. Ruffner had taught me well when I lived with her.

I swept the room three times. Then I got a dusting cloth and dusted it four times. I cleaned all the woodwork on the walls, every bench, table, and desk, going over each four times. I also moved every piece of furniture and cleaned every closet and corner in the room. I felt like my future depended a lot on how well I cleaned that room.

When I finished, I told the head teacher. She was a "Yankee" woman who knew exactly how to find dirt. She went into the room and checked the floor and closets. Then she took her handkerchief and rubbed it on the woodwork around the walls, the tables, and benches.
