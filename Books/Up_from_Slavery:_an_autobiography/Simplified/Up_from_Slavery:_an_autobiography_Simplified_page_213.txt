The wrong done to Black people is only temporary, but the damage to the morals of white people lasts a long time. I have seen many times that when someone lies to stop a Black person from voting, they soon start being dishonest in other parts of life too—not just with Black people, but with white people as well. A white person who starts by cheating a Black person usually ends up cheating a white person. A white person who breaks the law by hurting a Black person often gives in to the urge to hurt a white person too. Because of this, I think it’s important for the whole country to help lift the burden of ignorance from the South.

Another thing that is becoming clearer every year in education in the South is the impact of General Armstrong’s ideas. His influence is not just on Black people but on white people too. Right now, almost every Southern state is trying to provide industrial education for white boys and girls, and in many cases, these efforts can be traced back to General Armstrong.

Soon after we started our small boarding program, even more students began coming to us.
