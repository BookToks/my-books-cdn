K. Bruce, Governor Pinchback, and many others were strong, honest, and helpful men.

Not all the people called carpetbaggers were bad. Some, like ex-Governor Bullock of Georgia, were good and useful people.

Of course, many Black people, who didn’t have much education or experience in government, made big mistakes. Anyone in their situation probably would have made mistakes. Many Southern white people worry that if Black people are allowed to use their political rights now, the same mistakes from the Reconstruction period will happen again. I don’t think this will happen because Black people are much stronger and wiser than they were 35 years ago. They are learning that they can’t afford to act in ways that push away their white neighbors in the South.

I believe the best solution to the political problems between races is for each state that needs to change voting laws to make sure those laws are fair and honest for both Black and white people. They should not allow cheating or unfairness for either race. From what I see every day in the South, anything else would be unfair to Black people, unfair to white people, and unfair to the other states in the country. It would be like slavery—a wrong that someday we will have to pay for.
