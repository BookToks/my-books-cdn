They said that giving this recognition would show the good relationship between the two races. Of course, some people didn’t want to recognize the rights of Black people, but the Board of Directors, made up of the best and most forward-thinking men in the South, decided to invite a Black man to speak on the first day.

Next, they had to choose who would represent the Black race. After talking about it for several days, the directors all agreed to ask me to give one of the opening speeches. A few days later, I got the official invitation.

Getting this invitation made me feel a big responsibility that is hard for anyone not in my position to understand. What were my feelings when I got the invitation?

I remembered that I had been a slave; that I grew up very poor and with little education, and that I wasn’t really ready for such an important job. Just a few years before, any white man in the audience could have claimed me as his slave, and some of my old owners might even have been there to hear me speak.
