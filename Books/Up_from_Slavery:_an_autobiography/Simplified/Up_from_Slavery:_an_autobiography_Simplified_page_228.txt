First, always do everything you can to let people and groups know about our work. Second, don’t worry about the results. The second rule has been the hardest for me. When bills are about to be paid and there’s no money, it’s really hard not to worry. But I’m learning more each year that worrying just wastes energy and doesn’t help. That energy could be used for doing better work.

After meeting many rich and famous people, I’ve noticed that the most successful ones stay calm. They don’t get excited or lose control. They are always calm, patient, polite, and confident. I think President William McKinley is the best example of this kind of person I’ve ever seen.

To succeed in anything, I believe the most important thing is to grow to the point where you forget about yourself. You lose yourself in a big cause. The more you lose yourself like this, the happier you will be with your work.
