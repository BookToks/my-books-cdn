Like the "patrollers," the "Ku Klux" mostly worked at night. But they were even more cruel than the patrollers. Their main goal was to stop Black people from having any political power. However, they did more than that. They also burned schools and churches, and many innocent people suffered. During this time, quite a few Black people lost their lives.

When I was young, what these lawless groups did made a big impact on me. I saw a big fight happen in Malden between some Black and white people. There were about a hundred people fighting on each side. Many people got seriously hurt, including General Lewis Ruffner, who was married to my friend Mrs. Viola Ruffner. General Ruffner tried to protect the Black people, but he was knocked down and hurt so badly that he never fully got better. Watching this fight between the two races, I felt like there was no hope for Black people in this country. The "Ku Klux" time was, I think, the darkest part of the Reconstruction days.

I have talked about this hard part of the Southâ€™s history just to show how much things have changed since the days of the "Ku Klux."
