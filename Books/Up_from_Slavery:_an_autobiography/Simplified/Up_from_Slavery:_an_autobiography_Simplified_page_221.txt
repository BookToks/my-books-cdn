As a rule,the furniture in the students' rooms during the earlydays of the schoolconsisted ofabed, some stools, andsometimes a rough table made by the students. The plan of having the studentsmake the furnitureisstillfollowed,but the number ofpieces inaroomhas beenincreased, and theworkmanship has so improvedthat little fault canbefoundwith the articles now. Onething that I have always insisted upon at Tuskegee is that everywhere there should be absolute cleanliness.
 
 Over and over again the students were reminded in those first years—and are reminded now—that peoplewould excuse usfor ourpoverty,forour lack of comforts and conveniences,but that theywould not excuse us for dirt.
 
 Another thing that has been insistedupon at the school is the use ofthe tooth-brush. "The gospel ofthe tooth-brush," as GeneralArmstrong used to call it, is apart ofour creed atTuskegee. No student is permittedto remainwhodoes notkeep and use a tooth-brush. Several times, in recent years, students have come to uswho brought with them almost noother article except a tooth-brush. They hadheardfrom the lips ofolderstudents about our insisting upon the use of this,and so, to make a good impression, they brought at least a tooth MAKING THEIR BEDS 175 brush with them.
