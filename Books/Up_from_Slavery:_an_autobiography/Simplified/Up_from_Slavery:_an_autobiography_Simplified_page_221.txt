At first, the furniture in the students' rooms was simple. They had a bed, some stools, and sometimes a rough table made by the students themselves. The idea of having students make their own furniture is still used today. But now, there are more pieces in a room, and the quality has gotten much better, so the furniture is almost perfect.

One important rule I have always had at Tuskegee is that everything must be very clean.

In the early years, and even now, students were told many times that people would forgive us for being poor and not having many comforts. But they would never forgive us for being dirty.

Another rule at the school is about using a toothbrush. General Armstrong called it "the gospel of the toothbrush," and it is a big part of life at Tuskegee. No student is allowed to stay if they donâ€™t have and use a toothbrush. In recent years, some students came with almost nothing except a toothbrush because they heard from older students how important it is. They wanted to make a good impression, so they brought at least a toothbrush with them.
