In the afternoons, I like to go into the woods to spend some time close to nature. No one can bother me there. I’m surrounded by fresh air, trees, bushes, flowers, and the nice smells from many plants. I enjoy hearing the crickets chirp and the birds sing.

This is real rest.

When I’m at Tuskegee, my garden is another place where I find rest and happiness.

I like to be near real nature, not fake or made-up stuff. If I leave my office early, I spend thirty or forty minutes digging the soil, planting seeds, and taking care of the plants. This helps me feel strong and ready for the hard work waiting for me outside. I feel sorry for anyone who has never learned to enjoy nature and get energy and ideas from it.

Besides the many birds and animals at the school, I also keep some pigs and birds by myself. I really enjoy raising them. The pig is my favorite animal. Nothing makes me happier than having a good-quality Berkshire or Poland China pig.
