When Sunday came, the captain asked me to lead the religious service, but since I’m not a minister, I said no. The passengers still wanted me to give a speech in the dining room sometime during the trip, so I agreed. Senator Sewell led this meeting. After ten days of great weather, and without feeling seasick even once, we arrived at the interesting old city of Antwerp in Belgium.

The next day after we landed was one of the many holidays that people in those countries celebrate. It was a bright, beautiful day. Our hotel room looked out over the main public square, and I saw lots of new things—the people coming in from the countryside with all kinds of pretty flowers to sell, women bringing their dogs pulling big, shiny milk cans, and crowds going into the cathedral. It all felt very new and exciting to me.

After spending some time in Antwerp, we were invited to join a group of six people on a trip through Holland. This group included Edward Marshall and some American artists who had traveled on the same ship as us.
