Their main goal seemed to be to plant only cotton; in many cases, cotton was planted right up to the cabin’s front door.

In these cabins, I often saw sewing machines that people had bought or were still paying for in monthly payments, sometimes costing as much as sixty dollars. They also had fancy clocks that cost twelve or fourteen dollars. I remember once going into one of these cabins for dinner. When I sat down with the family of four, I noticed there was only one fork for all five of us at the table. It was a bit awkward. In the corner of the cabin, there was an organ that the family said they were paying sixty dollars a month for. One fork, but a sixty-dollar organ!

Most of the time, the sewing machine wasn’t even used. The clocks were so bad that they didn’t keep the right time—and even if they did, nine times out of ten, no one in the family could tell the time. The organ, of course, was rarely played because there was no one who knew how to play it.
