 In these cabin homes I often found sewingmachines which had been bought, or were being bought, on instalments, frequently at a cost of as much as sixtydollars, orshowyclocks forwhich the occupants of thecabins hadpaid twelve or fourteen dollars. I remember that on one occasion when I wentinto one of these cabins fordinner, when I sat down to the table for a meal with the four members of the family, I noticed that,while there were five ofus at the table, there was but one fork for the five ofus touse. Naturally there was an awkward pause onmypart. In the opposite corner of that same cabinwas an organ forwhich the people told me they were paying sixty dollars in monthly instalments. One fork, and a sixty-dollar organ!
