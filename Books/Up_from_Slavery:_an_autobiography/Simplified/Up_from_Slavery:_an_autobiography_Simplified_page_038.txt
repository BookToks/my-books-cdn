I was born a slave on a farm in Franklin County, Virginia. I’m not exactly sure where or when I was born, but I think it was near a small post office called Hale’s Ford around 1858 or 1859.

I don’t know the month or the day. The first things I remember are the farm and the slave cabins, which were the small houses where the slaves lived.

My life started in a very sad and lonely place. This wasn’t because my owners were super mean—they weren’t, compared to others. I was born in a small wooden cabin, about fourteen by sixteen feet in size.
