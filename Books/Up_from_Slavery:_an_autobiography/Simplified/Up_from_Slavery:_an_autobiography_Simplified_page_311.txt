Even though missing school a lot has its problems, there are some good things about it too.

Changing my work gives me a kind of rest.

I like riding long distances on the trains when I can sit somewhere comfortable.

I get rest on the trains, except when the one person who seems to be on every train comes up to me and says, "Isn't this Booker Washington? I want to meet you." Being away from school helps me forget the small details of my work and think about it in a bigger, clearer way than I could at school. It also lets me meet the best teachers and see the best education work happening.

But honestly, the best rest and fun I get is when I’m at Tuskegee. After dinner, I sit with my wife and my three kids—Portia, Baker, and Davidson—and we read stories or take turns telling stories.

To me, nothing beats that. Almost as good is spending an hour or more with them on Sundays, just like we like to do.
