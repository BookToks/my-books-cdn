While mybeing absent fromthe school so much unquestionably has its disadvantages, yet there are at the same time some compensations.
 
 The change ofwork brings a certainkind of rest.
 
 I enjoya ride ofa long distance on thecars,when I am permitted to ridewhere I can be comfortable.
 
 I get rest on the cars,except when the inevitable individualwho seems tobeon everytrain approaches mewith the nowfamiliarphrase: " Isn't this Booker Washington ? I want to introduce myself toyou." Absence from the school enables me to lose sight ofthe unimportant details of the work, and study it in a broader and more comprehensive manner than I could do on the grounds. This absence also brings me intocontactwith the bestwork being done in educational lines, and into contactwith the best educators inthe land.
 
 But, after all this issaid,thetimewhen I get the most solid rest and recreation is when I can be at Tuskegee, and, after our evening meal is over, can sit down, as is our custom, with mywife and Portia and Baker and Davidson, my three children, and read a story, or each take turns in telling a story.
 
 To me there is nothing onearth equal to that, although what is nearly equal toitis to gowith them for an hour or more, as we like to do on Sunday N O E N C E N G T G E E DIE IHK E S FAR S TU S RWOMTA .
