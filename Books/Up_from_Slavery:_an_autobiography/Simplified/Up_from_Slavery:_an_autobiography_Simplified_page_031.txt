INTRODUCTION XX The literature of the Negro inAmericais colossal, from political oratory through abolitionism to "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and " Cotton is King” — avastmass of books which manymenhave read to the waste of good years (and I among them); but the only books that I have read a second time or ever care again to read in the whole list (most of them by tiresome and unbalanced " reformers ") are " Uncle Remus" and " Up from Slavery" ; for these are the great literature ofthe subject. One has all the best of the past, the other foreshadows a better future ; and the men who wrote them are the only menwho havewritten of the subjectwith that perfect frankness and perfect knowledge and perfect poisewhose other name isgenius.
 
 Mr. Washington has won a world-wide fame at an early age. His story of his own life already has the distinction of translation into more languages, I think, than any other American book; and I suppose that he has as large a personal acquaintance among men of influence as any private citizen now living.
 
 His own teaching at Tuskegee is unique. He lectures to his advanced students on the art of right living,not out oftext-books,but straight out of life.
 
 Then he sends them into the countryto visit Negro families. Such a student will come back with a INTRODUCTION xxi minute report of the way in which the family that he has seen lives, what their earnings are,what they do well and what they do ill; and he will explain how they might live better.
