The books written about Black people in America are huge in number, covering everything from speeches to stories about ending slavery and famous books like "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and "Cotton is King." Many people have read these books, including me, but most are boring or one-sided.

The only books I’ve read twice and really like are "Uncle Remus" and "Up from Slavery." These two books are the best on the topic. One shows the best parts of the past, and the other looks forward to a better future. The writers of these books were honest, smart, and balanced, which is what true talent looks like.

Mr. Washington became famous all over the world when he was still young. His life story has been translated into more languages than almost any other American book. He also knows many important people.

At Tuskegee, where he teaches, Mr. Washington does things differently. He talks to his advanced students about how to live right, not from textbooks, but from real life.

Then, he sends these students out to visit Black families in the countryside. When they come back, they give detailed reports about how the families live, how much money they make, what they do well, and what they don’t. They also explain how these families could live better.
