Many times, when a new student wanted to spoil the look of a building by drawing on it with a pencil or cutting it with a knife, I heard an older student tell them, "Don't do that. This is our building. I helped build it."

In the early days of the school, one of the hardest things for me was making bricks.

Once we got the farm work going well, we started working on making bricks. We needed bricks to build our own buildings. But there was another reason for making bricks too. There was no place in town that made bricks, and besides needing them ourselves, other people wanted to buy bricks too.

I always felt sorry for the "Children of Israel" who had to make bricks without straw, but our problem was making bricks without money and without knowing how to do it.
