No one did more to help start the Tuskegee Institute and make sure it succeeded than Olivia A. Davidson.

Miss Davidson and I started planning the school's future from the very beginning. The students were getting better at reading and learning, but we quickly realized that just teaching books wasn’t enough. The students came from homes where they hadn’t learned how to take care of their bodies.

Most of the places where the students lived in Tuskegee weren’t much better than their old homes. We wanted to teach the students how to bathe, take care of their teeth and clothes. We also wanted to show them what to eat, how to eat properly, and how to keep their rooms clean.

Besides that, we wanted to give them real skills in a trade, along with the habits of hard work, saving money, and being careful with what they had. This way, they would know how to support themselves after leaving school. We wanted to teach them about real life, not just books.
