People of color from far away came to the school to see General Armstrong, about whom they had heard a lot. The General was welcomed not only by people of my own race but also by white people from the South.

This first visit General Armstrong made to Tuskegee gave me a chance to understand his character better than before. I mean his interest in the Southern white people. Before this, I thought that General Armstrong, having fought the Southern white man, might hold some anger toward the white South and only care about helping black people there.

But this visit showed me that I didnâ€™t really know how great and kind he was. I soon saw, through his visits and talks with Southern white people, that he cared just as much about their success and happiness as he did about black people. He held no bitterness against the South and was happy to show kindness whenever he could.

In all the time I knew General Armstrong, I never heard him say a single angry word about white people in the South, whether in public or private.
