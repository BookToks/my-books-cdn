Soon after Dr. Donald started talking, the rain came down really hard, and he had to stop while someone held an umbrella over him.

I didn’t realize how brave what I had done was until I saw a picture of the rector of Trinity Church standing in front of a big crowd under an old umbrella, waiting for the rain to stop so he could keep talking.

The rain didn’t last long, and Dr. Donald finished his sermon. It was a great sermon, even with the bad weather. After he went to his room and dried his wet clothes, Dr. Donald said that a big chapel at Tuskegee would be a good idea. The next day, two women traveling in Italy sent a letter saying they wanted to give money to build the chapel we needed.

Not long ago, we got twenty thousand dollars from Mr. Andrew Carnegie to help build a new library building.

Our first library and reading room were in a tiny shack, only about five by twelve feet. It took ten years of hard work raising money before I could get Mr. Carnegie’s support.
