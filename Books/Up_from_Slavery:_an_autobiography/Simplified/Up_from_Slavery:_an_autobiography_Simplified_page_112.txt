Since then, I have not had any patience with schools in the South for my people that didn’t teach students to respect hard work.

During my last year at Hampton, every minute I wasn’t working as a janitor, I spent studying hard. I was determined to do so well in my class that I would be chosen to speak at graduation. I succeeded. In June of 1875, I finished the regular course at Hampton.

The two biggest benefits I got from Hampton were meeting an amazing man, General S. C. Armstrong, who I believe was one of the strongest and kindest people I have ever met.

Second, at Hampton, I finally understood what education was really supposed to do for a person.

Before going there, I thought like many of my people that education meant having an easy life without needing to do hard work. At Hampton, I learned that working is not shameful. I even learned to love work, not just because it helps you make money, but because work itself is good and it gives you independence and confidence when you can do things the world needs.
