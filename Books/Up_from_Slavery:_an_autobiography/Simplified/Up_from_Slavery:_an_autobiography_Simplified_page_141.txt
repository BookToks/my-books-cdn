Some white passengers went into the baggage car to comfort Mr. Douglass. One of them said, "I’m sorry, Mr. Douglass, that you were treated so badly." Mr. Douglass sat up straight on the box and said, "No one can make Frederick Douglass feel less than he is. The soul inside me can’t be made smaller. It’s not me who is being hurt by this, but the people who are hurting me."

In one part of the country, the law says black and white people must sit in separate train cars. I once saw something funny that showed how hard it can be to tell who is black and who is white.

There was a man everyone knew as black, but he looked so white that even experts would find it hard to say if he was black. He was sitting in the train car for black passengers. When the conductor came to him, he looked confused. If the man was black, the conductor didn’t want to send him to the white car. But if he was white, the conductor didn’t want to offend him by asking if he was black.
