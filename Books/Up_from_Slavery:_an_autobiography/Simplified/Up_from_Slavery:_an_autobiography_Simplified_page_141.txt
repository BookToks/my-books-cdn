When some of the white passengers went into the baggage-car toconsole Mr. Douglass, and one of them said to him: " I am sorry, Mr. Douglass, that you have been degraded in this manner," Mr. Douglass straightened himselfup on the boxuponwhich he was sitting, and replied: " They cannot degrade Frederick Douglass. The soul thatiswithinmeno man candegrade. I am not the one that is being degraded on account of this treatment, but those who are inflicting itupon me." In one part of our country, where the law demands the separation of the races on the railroad trains, I saw at onetime a rather amusing instance which showed how difficult itsometimes is to know where the black begins and the white ends.
 
 There was a man who was well known in his community as aNegro, butwhowas so white that even an expert would have hard work to classify him as a black man. This man was riding in the part of the train set aside forthe colouredpassengers. When the train conductor reached him, he showed at once that hewas perplexed. If the man was a Negro, the conductor did not want to send him into the white people's coach; at the BLACK RACE AND RED RACE 101 same time, if he was a white man, the conductor did notwant to insulthim by asking him if hewas aNegro.
