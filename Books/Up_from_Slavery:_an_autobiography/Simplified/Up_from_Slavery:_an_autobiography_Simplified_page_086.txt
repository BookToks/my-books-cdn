I must have walked the streets until after midnight. At last, I was so tired that I couldn't walk anymore. I was tired, hungry, but not discouraged. Just when I reached my limit, I found a part of the street where the wooden sidewalk was higher than usual. I waited a few minutes until I was sure no one could see me, then I crawled under the sidewalk and lay down on the ground for the night, using my bag as a pillow.

All night, I could hear people walking above me. The next morning, I felt a little better, but I was very hungry because I hadn’t eaten enough for a long time. When it got light, I saw that I was near a big ship unloading pig iron. I went to the ship and asked the captain if I could help unload it to earn money for food. The captain, a kind white man, said yes.

I worked long enough to earn money for breakfast, and it was probably the best breakfast I’ve ever had. My work made the captain happy, and he told me I could keep working for a small amount of money each day if I wanted.
