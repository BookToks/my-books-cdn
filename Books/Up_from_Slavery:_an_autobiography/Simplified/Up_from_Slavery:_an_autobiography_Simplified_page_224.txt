CHAPTER XII RAISING MONEY

When we started our boarding department, we gave rooms in the attic of Porter Hall, our first building, to some girls. But the number of students, both boys and girls, kept growing. We could find rooms outside the school for many of the boys, but we didn’t want to do that for the girls. Soon, finding more rooms for the girls and a bigger boarding place for all the students became a big problem.

So, we decided to build a bigger building that would have rooms for the girls and boarding space for everyone.

After making a rough plan for the new building, we found out it would cost about ten thousand dollars. We didn’t have any money to start with, but we still decided to give the building a name. We knew we could name it, even though we weren’t sure how we would get the money to build it.
