This was the feeling that pushed me when I first got a chance to clean and dust the schoolroom at Hampton. I felt like my whole future depended on how well I did the job, so I worked hard to do it perfectly, without any mistakes.

I noticed that most people didn’t stop to ask if Mr. Tanner was a Black painter, a French painter, or a German painter when they looked at his paintings. They just knew he could make great art, and his skin color didn’t matter to them.

When a Black girl learns to cook, wash dishes, sew, or write a book, or when a Black boy learns to take care of horses, grow sweet potatoes, make butter, build a house, or practice medicine just as well or better than others, they will be rewarded no matter their race or color. In the end, the world will choose the best work, and things like race, religion, or past history won’t stop people from getting what they want.

I believe the future of my race depends on whether we can become so valuable that people in our towns and states feel we are needed for the happiness and well-being of the community.
