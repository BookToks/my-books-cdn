Huntington really appreciated the value of our work. I noticed that as the school became more useful, his donations grew too. I never met anyone who cared more kindly and kindly about our school than Mr. Huntington. He didn’t just give us money, but he also took time to give me advice, like a father would to his son, about how to run the school.

More than once, I found myself in tough spots while trying to raise money in the North. I only told this story once before because I thought people wouldn’t believe it. One morning, I was in Providence, Rhode Island, with no money at all to buy breakfast. While crossing the street to see a lady I hoped would give me money, I found a shiny new 25-cent coin right in the middle of the streetcar tracks. That 25 cents was enough for breakfast, and a few minutes later, the lady I went to see gave me a donation too.

At one of our graduation ceremonies, I was brave enough to ask Rev. E. Winchester Donald, D.D., the leader of Trinity Church in Boston, to give the sermon. Since our school didn’t have a big enough room for everyone, we held the ceremony under a large, makeshift shelter made from brush and rough boards.
