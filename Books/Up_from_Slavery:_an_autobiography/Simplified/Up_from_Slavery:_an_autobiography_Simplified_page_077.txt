Most of the time, Black kids have to work harder and do better than white kids just to get noticed. But because of this tough struggle, they gain strength and confidence that kids who have an easier path don’t always get.

No matter how you look at it, I’d rather be Black than belong to any other race, even the most privileged one. It makes me sad when people say they deserve special rights or respect just because of their race, without thinking about their own actions or qualities.

I feel sorry for those people because being part of a “better” race won’t help someone succeed unless they actually have something to offer. And being part of a “worse” race won’t stop someone from doing well if they truly have talent and worth. Everyone who faces unfair treatment should remember this important truth: in the end, no matter your skin color, real talent and hard work get noticed and rewarded.
