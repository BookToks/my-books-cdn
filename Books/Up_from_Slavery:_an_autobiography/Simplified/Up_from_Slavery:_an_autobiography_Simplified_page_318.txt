When I had been away from home for two weeks, I got this letter from him: Tuskegee, Alabama.

My Dear Papa: Before you left home, you told me to work at my trade half of each day. I like my work so much that I want to work at my trade all day. Also, I want to earn as much money as I can, so when I go to another school, I will have money to pay my expenses.

Your son, Booker.

My youngest child, Ernest Davidson Washington, says he wants to be a doctor. Besides going to school, where he studies books and does manual training, he also spends time in the office of our local doctor. He has already learned to do many tasks that a doctor’s office needs.

The thing I regret most in my life is that my work with public affairs keeps me away from my family a lot, even though I love being with them the most. I always wish I could spend my evenings at home. Sometimes I think people who have this chance don’t realize how lucky they are.
