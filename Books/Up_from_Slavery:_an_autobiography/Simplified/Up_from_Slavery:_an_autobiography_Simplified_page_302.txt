In all these things, the speaker said, his race had made the better choice. Then he asked white Americans to think carefully: "When you hear the full story of the brave actions of Black soldiers in the Spanish-American War, from both Northern and Southern soldiers, from people who used to be against slavery and those who used to own slaves, then decide for yourselves if a group of people willing to die for their country shouldnâ€™t have the best chance to live for it."

The part of the speech that got the most excitement was when I thanked the President for recognizing Black people in his appointments during the Spanish-American War. The President was sitting in a box to the right of the stage. When I spoke to him, I turned toward the box, and as I finished thanking him for his kindness, the whole crowd stood up and cheered loudly. They waved handkerchiefs, hats, and canes until the President stood up and bowed to say thank you.

When he did that, the crowd got even more excited, and the cheering was almost impossible to describe.
