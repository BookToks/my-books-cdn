Andthenhe madehis eloquent appealtotheconsciencesofthewhiteAmericans: "Whenyou havegottenthefullstoryoftheheroicconductoftheNegro in the Spanish-American war,have heard it from the lips ofNorthern soldier and Southern soldier,fromex-abolitionist and ex-masters, then decide withinyourselves whether arace that isthuswilling todie for its country should not begiventhe highest opportunitytoliveforitscountry."

The President was sitting inaboxatthe rightofthestage. WhenI addressed him I turnedtowardthebox, and as I finished the sentence thanking him forhis generosity, the whole audience rose and cheered again and again, waving handkerchiefs and hats and canes, until the President arose in the box and bowed his acknowledgments. At that the enthusiasm broke out again, and the demonstrationwasalmostindescribable.
