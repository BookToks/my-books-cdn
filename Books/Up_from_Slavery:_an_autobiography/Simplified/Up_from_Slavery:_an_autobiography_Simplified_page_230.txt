RAISING MONEY 183  

For example, there are two women in New York who don’t often appear in the news, but quietly, they have helped us build three big and important buildings over the last eight years. Besides giving these buildings, they have also made other generous donations to the school. They don’t just help Tuskegee; they are always looking for chances to support other good causes too.  

Even though I have helped raise many hundreds of thousands of dollars for Tuskegee, I have always avoided what people call "begging." I often tell people that I have never begged for money and that I am not a beggar. From what I’ve seen, asking rich people for money over and over usually doesn’t work.  

I usually believe that people who are smart enough to earn money are also smart enough to know how to give it away. Just sharing the facts about Tuskegee, especially about the work done by the graduates, has worked better than begging. I think presenting these facts in a respectful and serious way is the kind of "begging" most rich people accept.
