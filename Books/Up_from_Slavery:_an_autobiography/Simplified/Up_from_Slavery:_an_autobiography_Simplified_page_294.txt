I have been lucky to give talks at many top colleges like Harvard, Yale, Williams, Amherst, Fisk University, the University of Pennsylvania, Wellesley, the University of Michigan, Trinity College in North Carolina, and others.

I find it interesting that many people come up to shake my hand after my talk and say it’s the first time they have ever called a Black man "Mister." When I speak for the Tuskegee Institute, I usually set up several meetings ahead of time in important places.

This means I speak at churches, Sunday schools, Christian groups, and men’s and women’s clubs. Sometimes, I talk to as many as four groups in one day.

Three years ago, because of Mr. Morris K. Jesup from New York and Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the trustees of the John F. Slater Fund agreed to give money to help pay for Mrs. Washington and me to travel and hold meetings with Black people in big cities, especially in the southern states where slavery used to exist.
