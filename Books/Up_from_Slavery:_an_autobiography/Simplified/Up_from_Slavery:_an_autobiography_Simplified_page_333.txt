While we were in London, Ambassador Choate was very kind and paid a lot of attention to us. At a party hosted by the Ambassador, I met Mark Twain for the first time.

We were invited several times by Mrs. T. Fisher Unwin, who was the daughter of an important English politician named Richard Cobden. It felt like both Mr. and Mrs. Unwin wanted to do everything they could to make us comfortable and happy.

Later, we stayed for almost a week with the daughter of John Bright, now called Mrs. Clark, who lived in Street, England. Mr. and Mrs. Clark, along with their daughter, visited us in Tuskegee the next year.

In Birmingham, England, we stayed for a few days with Mr. Joseph Sturge. His father was a famous abolitionist and a friend of Whittier and Garrison. It was a big honor to meet people in England who had known and respected William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and other abolitionists.

The English abolitionists we met loved to talk about these two Americans. Before going to England, I didn’t really understand how interested the English abolitionists were in freedom or how much help they gave.

In Bristol, England, both Mrs. Washington and I spoke at the Women’s Liberal Club.
