In the middle of the dirt floor, there was a big, deep hole covered with boards. It was used to store sweet potatoes during the winter. I remember this potato-hole very clearly because when we were putting potatoes in or taking them out, I would sometimes get one or two. I roasted them and really enjoyed eating them.

There was no stove on our plantation. My mother had to cook for both the white people and the slaves over an open fire, mostly using pots and skillets. Our cabin was poorly built, so we were very cold in the winter. But in the summer, the heat from the open fire was also hard to handle.

The early years of my life in that little cabin were like the lives of many other slaves. My mother didn’t have much time to take care of her children during the day. She found a few moments to look after us early in the morning before work and again at night after she finished working.

One of my earliest memories is my mother cooking a chicken late at night and waking us up to feed us. I don’t know how or where she got the chicken, but I think it came from our owner’s farm.
