Washington, the head of a school for Black students in Tuskegee, Alabama, stood on the stage of the Auditorium. The sun was shining right into his eyes, and his face was glowing with passion. Clark Howell, who took over from Henry Grady, told me, "That man's speech is the start of a big moral change in America." It was the first time a Black man had spoken in the South at such an important event in front of white men and women. The crowd was shocked and excited, like a strong storm had just hit.

Mrs. Thompson had barely sat down when everyone looked at the dark-skinned Black men sitting in the front row on the stage. It was Professor Booker T. Washington, the leader of the Tuskegee school, who from now on would be seen as the most important Black man in America. Gilmore's Band played the "Star-Spangled Banner," and the crowd cheered. Then the music changed to "Dixie," and the crowd shouted loudly. The music changed again to "Yankee Doodle," and the noise calmed down.

Throughout all this, thousands of eyes stayed fixed on the Black speaker. Something unusual was about to happen. A Black man was going to speak for his people without anyone interrupting him. As Professor Washington walked to the front of the stage, the low sun sent bright rays through the windows into his face. A loud cheer welcomed him. He turned his head to avoid the bright light and moved around the stage to feel better. Then he faced the sun without blinking and began to speak.
