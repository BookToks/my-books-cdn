I have never met an audience that understands things so quickly and reacts so well. In the last few years, I have been lucky enough to speak to most of the important groups like this in big cities across the United States. The best time to talk to a group of business men is right after a good dinner, but I think one of the worst things ever made is the rule that a speaker has to sit through a fourteen-course dinner, always worried that their speech will be a total failure.

I rarely join these long dinners without wishing I could go back to the small cabin where I was a slave boy. There, I had an experience I will never forget—getting molasses to eat once a week from the "big house." On the plantation, we mostly ate cornbread and pork, but on Sunday mornings my mother was allowed to bring down a little molasses for her three children. When we got it, I wished every day was Sunday! I would take my tin plate and hold it out for the sweet treat, but I always closed my eyes while the molasses was poured, hoping that when I opened them, I’d be surprised by how much I got.
