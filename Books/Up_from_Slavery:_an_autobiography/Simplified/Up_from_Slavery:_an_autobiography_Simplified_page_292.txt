I have found no other audience so quick to see a point, and so responsive. Within the last few years I have hadthe privilege ofspeakingbefore most of the leading organizations of this kind in the large cities of the United States. The best time togethold of an organization ofbusiness men is after a good dinner, although I think that one of the worst instruments of torture that was ever invented is the custom which makes it necessary for a speaker to sitthrough a fourteen-course dinner, every minute ofthe time feeling sure that his speech is going to prove a dismal failure and disappointment.
 
 I rarely take part in one ofthese long dinners that I do notwish that I couldputmyself back in the little cabinwhere I was aslave boy, and again go through the experience there—one that I shall never forget—of getting molasses to eat once a week from the "big house." Our usual diet of the plantation was corn bread and pork, but on Sundaymorning mymotherwas permitted to bring down a little molassesfrom the "big house"for her three children,andwhen itwas received how I did wish that everydaywas Sunday! I would get my 246 UP FROM SLAVERY tinplate and holditup for the sweet morsel, but I would always shut my eyes while the molasses was being poured out into the plate,with the hope that when I opened them I would be surprised to see howmuch I had got.
