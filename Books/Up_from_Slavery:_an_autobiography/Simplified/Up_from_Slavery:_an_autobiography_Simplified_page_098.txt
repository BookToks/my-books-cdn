The cost for my room and board at Hampton was ten dollars a month. I had to pay some of this money in cash and work to earn the rest. When I first got there, I only had fifty cents to pay.

Besides a little money my brother John sent me sometimes, I didn’t have any other money to pay for my board. I was determined to do such a good job as a janitor that they couldn’t do without me. I did such a good job that they soon told me I could pay for my board completely with my work.

The tuition cost seventy dollars a year, which I couldn’t afford at all. If I had to pay both tuition and board, I would have had to leave Hampton. But General Armstrong kindly asked Mr. S. Griffitts Morgan from New Bedford, Massachusetts, to pay my tuition while I was at Hampton.

After I finished my studies at Hampton and started working at Tuskegee, I had the chance to visit Mr. Morgan several times.
