The charge for my board at Hampton was ten dollars per month. I was expected to pay a part ofthis incash and towork outthe remainder. To meet this cash payment, as I have stated, I had just fifty cents when I reached the institution.
 
 Aside from a very few dollars that my brother John was able to send me once in a while, I had no money with which to pay my board. I was determined from the first to make my work as janitor so valuable that my services would be indispensable. This I succeeded in doing to such an extent that I was soon informed that I would be allowed the full cost of myboard in return for my work. The cost of tuition was seventy dollars a year. This, of course, was wholly beyond my ability to provide. IfI had beencompelled to pay the seventy dollars for tuition, in addition to providing for my board, Iwould have been compelled to leave the Hampton school. General Armstrong, however, very kindly got Mr. S. Griffitts Morgan, of New Bedford, Mass., to defray the cost of my tuitionduring thewholetime that I was at Hampton. After I finished the course at Hampton and had entered upon my lifework at Tuskegee, I had the pleasure ofvisiting Mr. Morgan several times.
