On the morning of September 17, I started for Atlanta with Mrs. Washington and my three kids. I felt pretty nervous, kind of like a person does when they know something bad might happen. When we passed through the town of Tuskegee, I met a white farmer who lived out in the countryside. Jokingly, he said, "Washington, you have talked to Northern white people, Southern Black people, and Southern white people. But in Atlanta tomorrow, you will have Northern whites, Southern whites, and Black people all together. I’m afraid you’ve gotten yourself into a tough spot." He understood the situation well, but his words didn’t make me feel any better.

On the trip from Tuskegee to Atlanta, both Black and white people came to the train to point me out. They talked openly, right where I could hear them, about what was going to happen the next day. When we arrived in Atlanta, a group met us. Almost the first thing I heard when I got off the train was an old Black man nearby say something like, "That’s the man from my race who’s going to give a speech at the Exposition tomorrow."
