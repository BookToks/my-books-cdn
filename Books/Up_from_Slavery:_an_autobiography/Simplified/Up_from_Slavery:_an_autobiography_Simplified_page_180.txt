I noticed that the veryfact that they had been asked to contribute toward the purchaseofthe land madethem begin to feel as if it wasgoing to be their school, to a large degree. I noted that just in proportion as we madethewhite people feel that the institution was a part of the life ofthe community,and that, while we wanted to make friends in Boston, for example, we alsowanted to make white friends in Tuskegee, and thatwewanted to make the school ofreal servicetoall the people,their attitude toward the school became favourable.
 
 Perhaps I might add right here,what I hope to demonstrate later,that,so far asIknow,the Tuskegeeschool at the present time has no warmer and more enthusiastic friends anywhere than it has among the white citizens ofTuskegee and throughout the state of Alabama and the entire South.
 
 From the first, I have advised our people in the South to make friends in every straightforward, manlyway with their next-door neighbour, whether hebe ablack man or a white man. I have also advised them, where no principle is at stake, to consult the interests oftheir local communities, and to advise with their friends in regard to their voting.
