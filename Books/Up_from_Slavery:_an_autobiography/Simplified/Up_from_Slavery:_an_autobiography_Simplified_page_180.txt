I noticed that when people were asked to help pay for the land, they started to feel like the school was theirs in a big way. I saw that the more we made white people feel like the school was part of their community, and that we wanted to be friends with white people not just in Boston but also in Tuskegee, the more they liked the school.

I want to add that, as far as I know, the Tuskegee school has some of its best and most excited supporters among white people in Tuskegee, all over Alabama, and throughout the South.

From the start, I told our people in the South to make friends honestly and kindly with their neighbors, whether they were black or white. I also told them to think about what was best for their local communities and to talk with their friends when deciding how to vote, unless it was about something very important.

For many months, we worked nonstop to raise the money needed to buy the farm.
