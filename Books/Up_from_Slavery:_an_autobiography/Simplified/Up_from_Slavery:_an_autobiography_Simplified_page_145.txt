They were supposed to be paid a little more than the cost of their food and housing for their work.

Most of the money they earned was saved in the school's fund. This money would be used to pay for their food and housing when they became students in the day-school, after spending one or two years in the night-school. This way, they would get a good start with their books and learn a trade or skill, along with other important benefits from the school.

General Armstrong asked me to run the night-school, and I agreed. When the school started, about twelve hardworking men and women joined the class. During the day, most of the young men worked in the school's sawmill, and the young women worked in the laundry. The work was hard in both places, but I never taught students who made me as happy as these did.

They were good learners and really understood their work. They were so serious about learning that they only stopped when the bell rang to end the day. Sometimes, they even asked me to keep teaching after it was time to go to bed.
