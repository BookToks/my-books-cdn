Right now, having the chance to earn a dollar in a factory is way more valuable than having the chance to spend a dollar at an opera house.

To sum up, I want to say again that nothing in the last thirty years has given us more hope and brought us closer to you, the white race, than the chance offered by this Exposition. Standing here, like at an altar that shows the results of the hard work of both our races, who started almost empty-handed thirty years ago, I promise that in your work to solve the big and complicated problems in the South, you will always have the patient and understanding support of my race.

Just remember, while the things shown in these buildings—like products from farms, forests, mines, factories, books, and art—will bring many benefits, something even more important will come. Let’s pray that it will erase the differences and hatreds between regions and races, bring a strong commitment to fairness, and make everyone follow the law without question.

This, along with our growing wealth, will bring a new and better life to our beloved South.
