In the early days of freedom, almost every Black man who learned to read would get "a call to preach" within a few days after he started reading. At my home in West Virginia, the way people were called to be ministers was very interesting. Usually, the "call" happened when the person was sitting in church. Suddenly, the person would fall to the floor like they were shot, and they would stay there for hours, unable to speak or move. Then the news would spread all over the neighborhood that this person had received a "call."

If the person tried to ignore the call, they would fall down again one or two more times. In the end, they always accepted the call. I really wanted an education, but I was also afraid that once I learned to read and write well, I would get one of these "calls." But for some reason, I never got one.

If you count the number of completely uneducated men who preached or gave speeches with those who had some education, you can see that there were a lot of ministers. 

In fact, I once knew a church with about two hundred members, and eighteen of them were ministers.
