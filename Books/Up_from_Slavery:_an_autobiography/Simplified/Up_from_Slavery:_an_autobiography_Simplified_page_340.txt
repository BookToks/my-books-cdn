Reid, Cashier at Kanawha National Bank; Geo. S. Laidley, Superintendent of City Schools; L. E. McWhorter, President of the Board of Education; Chas. K. Payne, wholesale merchant; and many others.

This invitation came from the City Council, state officers, and important citizens from both races in the community where I grew up. I had left a few years before, unknown, poor, and uneducated, to get an education. The invitation surprised me and almost made me cry. I couldnâ€™t understand why they were doing this for me.

I accepted the invitation. On the day of the event, a group led by ex-Governor W. A. MacCorkle met me at the train station in Charleston. The group had people from both races. The public reception was held in the Opera House in Charleston. The Governor of the state, Hon. George W. Atkinson, was in charge, and ex-Governor MacCorkle gave a welcome speech. Many Black citizens played a big part in the reception. The Opera House was full of people from both races, including many white people I had worked for as a boy.

The next day, Governor and Mrs. Atkinson hosted a public reception for me at the State House. People from all backgrounds came to it.
