 This invitation, coming as it did from the City Council, the state officers, and all the substantial citizens of both races of the community where I had spent my boyhood, and from which I had gone a few years before,unknown, in povertyand ignorance, in quest of an education, not only surprised me, but almost unmanned me. I could not understand what I had done to deserve it all.
 
 I accepted the invitation, and at the appointed daywas met atthe railway station at Charleston by a committee headed by ex-Governor W. A. МасCorkle, and composed ofmenof both races. The public reception was held in the Opera-House at Charleston. The Governor ofthe state, the Hon.
 
 George W. Atkinson, presided, and an address of welcome was made by ex-Governor MacCorkle. A prominent part in the reception was taken by the coloured citizens. The Opera-Housewas filledwith citizens of both races, and among thewhite people were many for whom I had worked when a boy.
 
 The next day Governor and Mrs. Atkinson gave me a public reception at the State House, which was attended by all classes.
