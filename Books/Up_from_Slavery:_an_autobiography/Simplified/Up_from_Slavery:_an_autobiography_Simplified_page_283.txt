I don’t think Black people should stop voting because you can’t learn how to govern yourself if you don’t vote, just like a boy can’t learn to swim by staying out of the water. But I do think when they vote, they should listen more to smart and good people who live nearby.

I know some Black men who, with the help and advice of white people in the South, have made a lot of money and bought property. But at the same time, those men wouldn’t ask those same white people for advice about voting. I think that’s not smart and it should change. I don’t mean Black people should just vote to please others or stop voting based on their beliefs. If they stop voting for what they believe in, even Southern white people will lose respect for them.

I don’t think any state should make a law that lets a poor and uneducated white man vote but stops a Black man in the same situation from voting. That kind of law is unfair, and all unfair laws cause problems eventually. This kind of law makes Black people want to get educated and own property, but it also makes white people stay poor and uneducated.
