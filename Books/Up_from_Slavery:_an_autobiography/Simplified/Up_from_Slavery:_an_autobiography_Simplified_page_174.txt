When I told the young men about my plan, I saw that they didn’t like it very much. They found it hard to understand how clearing land was connected to getting an education.

Also, many of them used to be teachers, and they wondered if clearing land was something that fit with their pride. To help them feel better, every afternoon after school, I took my axe and went to the woods first. When they saw I wasn’t scared or embarrassed to work, they started helping more eagerly. We worked every afternoon until we cleared about twenty acres and planted crops.

Meanwhile, Miss Davidson was thinking of ways to pay back the loan. Her first idea was to hold festivals, called "suppers." She went around to white and colored families in Tuskegee and asked them to donate things like cakes, chickens, bread, or pies to sell at the festival.

The colored people were happy to give whatever they could, but I want to say that Miss Davidson didn’t ask any white family that didn’t give something. Many white families showed they cared about the school in different ways.
