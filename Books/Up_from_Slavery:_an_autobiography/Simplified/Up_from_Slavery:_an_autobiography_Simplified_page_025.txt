I was the only white man in the room, and what I saw and heard made a big impact on me that I will never forget. Mr. Washington stood up and asked them to sing one old song after another—songs I had heard all my life. But I had never heard them sung by a thousand voices or by educated Black people. I used to think of these songs as belonging to Black people from the past, not to those who were trying to improve their lives. These songs made me think of plantations, cabins, and slaves, not free Black people who wanted to learn and grow. But on those plantations and in those cabins, these songs were never sung like this by these thousand students. I remembered all the old plantations I had ever seen, and the whole history of Black people came to my mind. The deep sadness in their lives showed through these songs in a way I had never felt before.

What about the future? These young people were full of hope and worked harder than most students I knew. Another song filled the room. When it ended and it got quiet, I found myself looking at all these faces, but my mind wasn’t on them. I was thinking about a sad part of our country’s history that came after a big mistake made by the country’s founders. I was thinking about a problem that many leaders had argued about for years, a problem so big that it held back many English people in the Southern States by a hundred years, compared to people in other parts of the world like England, Australia, and the Northern and Western States. I was thinking about this dark shadow that had troubled every great leader from Jefferson to Lincoln.
