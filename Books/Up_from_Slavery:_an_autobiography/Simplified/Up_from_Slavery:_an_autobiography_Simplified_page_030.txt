This shows how well the Hampton-Tuskegee idea works, just like it shows how important democracy is—a fact that’s now clear, even though there were many challenges.

Think about how much the conversation about the Negro problem has changed in twenty years.

Twenty or thirty years ago, experts and kind people talked about things like sending Black people away, making them live in certain areas, or worrying if they would take over the South because of having many children. They said a lot of crazy things.

Now, all of that has been replaced by a simple plan: to offer the same kind of training to poor people of both races, like the Hampton-Tuskegee system. In a way, the "problem" isn’t really a problem anymore. The South’s future depends on how fast or slow this kind of training grows and helps its people and land. This big change shows how important Mr. Washington’s work really is.
