Making these bricks taught me an important lesson about the relationship between Black and white people in the South. Many white people who didn’t know about our school, and maybe didn’t support it, came to us to buy bricks because they found out our bricks were good. They realized we were meeting a real need in the community.

Making these bricks helped many white neighbors start to see that educating Black students wasn’t a waste. Instead, it showed that teaching us was adding value to the community’s wealth and comfort. As people from the neighborhood came to buy bricks, we got to know them better. They traded with us, and we traded with them. Our business was connected. We had something they wanted, and they had something we wanted.

This really helped build the friendly relationships that have lasted between us and the white people in that area. Now, these good relations spread across the South.
