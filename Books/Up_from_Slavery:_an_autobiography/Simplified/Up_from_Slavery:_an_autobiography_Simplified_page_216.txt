I often feel shy because of the many kind things people do for me. The students don’t want me to carry heavy books or bags around the school. Many of them always offer to help me with my things. Almost every time I go outside when it’s raining, a student comes over with an umbrella and asks if they can hold it for me.

While writing about this, I’m happy to say that I have never been insulted by the white people I have met in the South. The white people in and near Tuskegee, especially, seem proud to show me respect and often go out of their way to do so.

Not long ago, I was traveling between Dallas, Texas, and Houston. Somehow, people found out I was on the train. At almost every stop, many white people, including town officials, came on the train, introduced themselves, and thanked me warmly for the work I was doing in the South.

One time, when I was traveling from Augusta, Georgia, to Atlanta, I was very tired from all the traveling, so I rode in a Pullman sleeper car.
