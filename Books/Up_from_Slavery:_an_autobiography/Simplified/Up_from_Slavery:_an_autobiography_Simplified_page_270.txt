Gentlemen of the Exposition, as we show you our simple progress, please don’t expect too much. Thirty years ago, we only owned a few quilts, pumpkins, and chickens collected from different places. Think about how far we have come from that to creating tools for farming, buggies, steam engines, newspapers, books, statues, carvings, paintings, and running drugstores and banks. This journey was not easy and had many challenges.

We are proud of what we show you as a result of our hard work, but we know we wouldn’t be here without the help we’ve received. This help came not only from Southern states but also from kind people in the North who have supported us with gifts and encouragement.

The smartest people in my race know that fighting for social equality in a loud way is not helpful. Progress and getting all the rights we deserve will come from hard and steady work, not by forcing things. No group that has something useful to offer the world’s markets stays ignored for long. It’s important that we have all the rights under the law, but even more important that we are ready to use these rights well.
