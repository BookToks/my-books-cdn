THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS 223 Gentlemen of the Exposition, as we present to you our humble effort at an exhibition ofourprogress,you mustnotexpectovermuch. Startingthirty years agowith ownership here and there in a few quilts and pumpkins and chickens (gathered from miscellaneous sources),rememberthe path that has led from these to the inventions and production of agricultural implements,buggies, steam-engines, newspapers, books, statuary, carving, paintings, the managementofdrug-stores and banks,has not been trodden without contact with thorns and thistles.
 
 Whilewe take prideinwhatwe exhibit as a result ofour independent efforts, wedo not for amoment forget that our part in this exhibitionwould fall far short ofyour expectations but forthe constanthelp thathas come to oureducational life, notonly from the Southern states, but especially from Northern philanthropists,whohavemadetheirgifts aconstant stream ofblessing and encouragement.
 
 Thewisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions ofsocial equality isthe extremest folly, and that progress in the enjoyment ofall the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing. No race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long inanydegree ostracized. Itis important and UP FROM SLAVERY 224 right that all privilegesofthelawbe ours,but it is vastlymore important that we be preparedfor the exercises of these privileges.
