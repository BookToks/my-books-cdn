In a few places, I saw people holding bright-colored cards made for ads, and they were using them a lot. In some homes, someone had bought a new gun. Most of the time, there was nothing in the cabin that showed Christmas was coming, except that people had stopped working in the fields and were just hanging out at home.  

At night during Christmas week, they usually had what they called a "frolic" in one of the cabins on the plantation. This was a rough kind of dance where a lot of whiskey was probably used, and sometimes there might be shooting or fighting with razors.  

While I was visiting at Christmas, I met an old Black man who was one of the many local preachers. He tried to convince me, using the story of Adam in the Garden of Eden, that God had cursed all work and that it was a sin for anyone to work. Because of this, he tried to do as little work as possible. At that time, he seemed very happy because he was living through one week without sin, as he said.  

At the school, we worked hard to teach our students what Christmas really means and how to celebrate it the right way.
