From the very beginning, I was determined to keep the school's reputation strong. I think I can say without bragging that we have done this throughout all these years.

I will always remember some advice Mr. George W. Campbell gave me. He was the white man who helped General Armstrong decide to send me to Tuskegee. Soon after I started working, Mr. Campbell told me, like a father: "Washington, always remember that credit is capital." 

One time, when we were really struggling for money, I told General Armstrong honestly about our problem. Without any doubt, he gave me a personal check for all the money he had saved for himself.

This was not the only time General Armstrong helped Tuskegee like this. I don’t think I ever shared this story before.

In the summer of 1882, after the school’s first year, I married Miss Fannie N. Smith from Malden, West Virginia. We started living together in Tuskegee in early fall. This created a home for our teachers, who had now grown to four in number.
