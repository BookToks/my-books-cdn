One thing I wasdeterminedtodofrom the first, and thatwas to keep the credit of the school high; and this, I think I can saywithout boasting, wehavedoneall through theseyears.
 
 Ishall always remember a bitofadvicegivenme by Mr. George W. Campbell, the white man to whom I have referred as the one whoinduced General Armstrong to send me to Tuskegee. Soon after I entered upon thework Mr. Campbell said to me, in his fatherly way: "Washington, always remember that credit is capital." Atone timewhen wewere inthegreatestdistress for moneythat we ever experienced, I placed the situationfranklybeforeGeneral Armstrong. Without hesitationhegave me his personal check for all the money which he had saved for his own use.
 
 Thiswas not the onlytime that General Armstrong helped Tuskegee in this way. I do not think I have ever made this fact public before.
 
 During the summer of 1882, at the end of the first year's work of the school, I was married to Miss Fannie N. Smith, of Malden, W. Va. We began keeping house in Tuskegee early in the fall. This madeahome for our teachers,who now ANXIOUS DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS 147 had been increased to four in number.
