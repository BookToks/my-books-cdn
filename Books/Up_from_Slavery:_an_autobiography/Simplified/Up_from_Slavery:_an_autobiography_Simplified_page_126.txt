The chances to get into politics were really tempting, and I almost gave in at one point. But I felt I could help more by building a strong foundation for our people through good education for the hands, mind, and heart.

I saw Black men in state governments and county jobs who sometimes couldn’t read or write and didn’t have strong morals.

Not long ago, I walked through a Southern city and heard bricklayers shouting from the top of a two-story building. They were calling for the "Governor" to bring more bricks quickly. They kept saying, "Hurry up, Governor!"

I got curious and asked who the "Governor" was. I found out he was a Black man who had once been the Lieutenant-Governor of his state.

But not all Black people in office during Reconstruction were bad. Some, like the late Senator B., were truly worthy of their positions.
