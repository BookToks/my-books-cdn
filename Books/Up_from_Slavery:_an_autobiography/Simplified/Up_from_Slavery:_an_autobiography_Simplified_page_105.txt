I started everything thinking I could succeed, and I never had much patience for people who always said you couldn’t succeed.

I have always respected people who could tell me how to succeed. I decided to face my situation exactly as it was. At the end of the week, I went to the treasurer of Hampton Institute, General J. F. B. Marshall, and honestly told him my situation. I was happy when he said I could come back to school and that he trusted me to pay the debt when I could. During my second year, I kept working as a janitor.

The education I got at Hampton was more than just from textbooks. One big thing that stuck with me in the second year was how selfless the teachers were. It was hard for me to understand how anyone could be so happy working for others. By the end of the year, I think I learned that the happiest people are the ones who do the most for others. I have tried to remember this lesson ever since.

I also learned an important lesson at Hampton by seeing the best kinds of farm animals and birds. I don’t think any student who had this chance could go out into the world and be okay with doing the worst work.
