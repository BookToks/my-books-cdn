Mrs.
 
 Ruffner always encouraged and sympathized with me in all my efforts to get an education. It was while livingwith her thatIbegantoget togethermy first library. I securedadry-goodsbox,knockedout one side of it, put some shelves in it, and began putting into it every kind of book that I could get my hands upon, and called it my " library." Notwithstanding my success at Mrs. Ruffner's I did not give up the idea ofgoing to the Hampton Institute. In the fall of1872 I determined to make an effort to get there, although, as I have stated, I had no definite idea of the direction in which Hampton was, or of what it would cost to go there. I do notthink that any one thoroughly sympathized with me in my ambition to go to Hampton unless it was my mother, and she was troubled with a grave fear that I was starting out on a "wild-goose chase." At any rate, I got only ahalf-heartedconsent from her that I might start.
 
 The small amount ofmoney that I had earned had been consumedby my stepfather and the remainder ofthe family, with the exception of avery few dollars, and so I had very little with which to buy 46 UP FROM SLAVERY clothes and pay my travelling expenses.
