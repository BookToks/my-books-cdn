Mrs. Ruffner always supported me and understood my efforts to get an education. While living with her, I started my first library. I found a dry-goods box, took out one side, put in some shelves, and began filling it with every kind of book I could find. I called it my "library."

Even though I was doing well with Mrs. Ruffner, I didn’t give up on going to the Hampton Institute. In the fall of 1872, I decided to try to get there, even though I didn’t really know where Hampton was or how much it would cost. I don’t think anyone really understood or supported my goal except my mother, and she was worried that I was chasing something impossible. So, she only gave me a weak “okay” to start.

Most of the little money I had earned was taken by my stepfather and the rest of the family, except for a few dollars. So, I didn’t have much left to buy clothes or pay for my travel.
