Some newspapers in the South misunderstood part of my speech in Chicago and started to criticize me a lot. This went on for weeks until the editor of the Age-Herald in Birmingham, Alabama, wrote to me asking if I could explain exactly what I meant. I answered him in a letter that seemed to clear things up.

In my letter, I said that I always make sure to say the same things in the North as I would in the South. I didn’t think I needed to explain more because I had already spent seventeen years working in the South, and that should be enough to understand me. I also repeated my request from my Atlanta speech to stop race prejudice in business and everyday life. I said I don’t talk about social acceptance, and then I quoted what I said about that in Atlanta.

When I’m at public events, there’s one kind of person I really don’t like: the crank. I’ve gotten so used to these people that I can spot them from far away when they push through the crowd to get to me.
