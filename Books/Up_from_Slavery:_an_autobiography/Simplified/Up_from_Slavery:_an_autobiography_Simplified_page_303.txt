256 UP FROM SLAVERY One portion of my address at Chicago seemed tohavebeenmisunderstood bythe Southern press, and some of the Southern papers took occasion to criticise me rather strongly. These criticisms continued for severalweeks, until I finally received a letter from the editor of theAge-Herald, published in Birmingham, Ala.,asking me if I would sayjust what I meant by this part of myaddress. I replied to him in aletterwhich seemedtosatisfy my critics. In this letter I said that I had made it a rule never to saybefore a Northern audience anything that I would not say before an audience in the South. I said that I did not think it was necessaryforme togointoextendedexplanations; if my seventeen years ofwork in the heart of the South had not been explanation enough, I did not see howwords could explain. I said that I made the same plea that I had made in my address at Atlanta, for the blotting out of race prejudice in "commercial and civil relations." I said thatwhat is termed social recognition was a question which I never discussed, and then I quoted from my Atlanta addresswhat I had saidthere inregardtothat subject.
