Booker T. Washington was an important African American leader long ago. He worked hard to help Black people get a better education and improve their lives.

He believed that learning skills and getting a good job were the best ways for Black people to succeed. Washington started a school called the Tuskegee Institute to teach these skills.

Many people respected him because he spoke calmly and tried to bring different groups together. Even though some disagreed with his ideas, he made a big impact on history.
