I think there are few things as mentally and physically exciting as when a public speaker feels like they have a big audience completely listening to them. There is a strong connection between the speaker and the audience, like an invisible thread that links them together.

If there is one person in a crowd of a thousand who doesn’t agree with me or seems doubtful, cold, or critical, I can usually spot them. When I find that person, I focus on them, and it feels great to see them start to change their mind. I’ve found that the best way to reach these people is by telling a story at first. But I never tell a story just for fun, because that feels empty and the audience can tell.

I believe it’s unfair to both the speaker and the audience if someone talks just to talk. I think you should only speak if, deep down, you truly believe you have something important to say.
