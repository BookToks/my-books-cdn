CHAPTER XVI Europe IN 1893

I married Miss Margaret James Murray. She was from Mississippi and graduated from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. She had come to Tuskegee as a teacher a few years before, and when we got married, she was working as the Lady Principal.

Mrs. Washington helps me a lot with the school. She takes care of many problems so I donâ€™t have to handle them alone. Besides her school work, she also runs a mothers' meeting in the town of Tuskegee. She works with women, children, and men who live on a big farm about eight miles away.

The mothers' meeting and the farm work are not just to help the people there. They also serve as examples for our students to follow when they leave school and start their own careers.
