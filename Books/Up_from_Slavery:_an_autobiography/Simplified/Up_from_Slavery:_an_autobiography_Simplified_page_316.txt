CHAPTER XVI Europe IN 1893 I was married to Miss Margaret James Murray, a native of Mississippi, and agraduate of Fisk University, in Nashville, Tenn., who had come to Tuskegee as a teacher several years before, and at the timewe were married was filling the position of Lady Principal. Not only is Mrs. Washington completely one with me in the work directly connected with the school, relieving me of many burdens and perplexities, but aside from her work on the school grounds,she carries on a mothers' meeting in the town of Tuskegee, and a plantation work among thewomen, children, and men who live in a settlement connected with a large plantation about eight milesfrom Tuskegee.
 
 Both the mothers' meeting and the plantationwork are carried on, not only with a view to helping those who are directly reached, but also for the purpose of furnishing object-lessons in these two kinds of work that may be followed by our 267 268 UP FROM SLAVERY students when theygo out into theworldfor their own life-work.
