Washington, thank you for giving me the chance to help a good cause. Itâ€™s an honor to be part of it. We in Boston are always grateful to you for doing our work.

From my experience getting money, I believe that the first kind of person is becoming rare. More and more, rich people see those who ask for help not as beggars, but as people working to do important things.

In Boston, I hardly ever asked someone for money without being thanked first. The donors there seem to feel proud and lucky to be able to give. Nowhere else have I seen this kind and generous spirit as much as in Boston, although it exists in other places too. I believe the world is becoming more giving. My main rule when asking for money has been to give people the chance to help.

In the early years of the Tuskegee school, I spent many days walking streets and country roads in the North without getting a single dollar.
