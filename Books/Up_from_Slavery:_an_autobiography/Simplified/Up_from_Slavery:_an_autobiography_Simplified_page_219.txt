I really enjoy meeting with our students more than anything else, and these meetings help me a lot when I plan for the future. I feel like these talks let me understand what really matters to the school. 

Not many things help a person more than giving them responsibility and showing that you trust them. When I read about fights between bosses and workers, I often think many problems could be avoided if bosses got closer to their workers, talked with them, and made them feel like they both want the same thing.

Everyone reacts well to trust, and this is especially true for Black people. 

If they know you care about them without wanting anything for yourself, you can guide them in many ways.

When I started at Tuskegee, my goal was not only for the students to build the school buildings themselves but also to make their own furniture as much as possible. I am amazed at how patient the students were, sleeping on the floor while waiting for a bed frame to be built or sleeping without a mattress while waiting for something that looked like a mattress to be made.
