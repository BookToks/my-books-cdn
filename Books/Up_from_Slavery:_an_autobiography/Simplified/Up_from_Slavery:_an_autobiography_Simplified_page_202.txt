I thanked him for his advice and continued on my trip.

The first place I went to in the North was Northampton, Massachusetts. I spent almost half a day looking for a Black family I could stay with, not thinking that any hotel would let me in.

I was really surprised when I found out that I could easily stay at a hotel.

We managed to get enough money so that on Thanksgiving Day that year, we held our first service in the chapel of Porter Hall, even though the building wasn’t finished.

While looking for someone to give the Thanksgiving sermon, I met one of the most amazing people I’ve ever known.

This was Reverend Robert C. Bedford, a white man from Wisconsin, who was then pastor of a small Black Congregational church in Montgomery, Alabama.

Before going to Montgomery to find someone to preach the sermon, I had never heard of Mr. Bedford. He had never heard of me either. He happily agreed to come to Tuskegee and lead the Thanksgiving service. It was the first time the Black people there had ever seen a service like that, and they showed a lot of interest in it!
