LAST WORDS 311 å¤§ Twentyyears have nowpassed since I madethe first humble effort at Tuskegee, in a broken-down shanty and an old hen-house, without owning a dollar's worth ofproperty,and with but one teacher and thirty students. Atthe present time the institution owns twenty-three hundred acres of land, one thousand of which are under cultivation each year, entirely by student labour. There are now upon the grounds, counting large and small, sixty-six buildings; and all exceptfourofthese have been almost wholly erected by the labour of our students. While the students are at work upon the land and in erectingbuildings,they aretaught, by competent instructors, the latest methods of agriculture and the trades connectedwith building.
 
 There are in constant operation at the school, in connection with thorough academic and religious training, thirty industrial departments. All of these teach industries at which our men and women can find immediate employment as soon as they leave the institution. The onlydifficulty now is that the demand for our graduates from both white andblack people in theSouth is sogreat that we cannot supply more than one-half the persons forwhom applications come to us. Neither have we the buildings nor the money for current expenses to enable us to admit to the school more 312 UP FROM SLAVERY than one-half the young men and women who apply to us for admission.
