Twenty years ago, I started Tuskegee in a old, run-down shack and an old henhouse. I didn’t own any land or buildings, and there was only one teacher and thirty students.

Now, the school owns 2,300 acres of land, and every year, students farm 1,000 of those acres by themselves. There are 66 buildings on the campus, big and small, and students helped build all but four of them. While working on the land and buildings, students also learn the newest ways to farm and do construction from skilled teachers.

The school runs thirty different work programs alongside regular classes and religious lessons. These programs teach skills that help our students get jobs right after they finish school. The problem is that so many people want to come here—both black and white—that we can only accept about half of the applicants. We also don’t have enough buildings or money to take in more students.
