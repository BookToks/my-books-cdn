At this concert, the Honorable Benjamin B. Odell, Jr., the governor of New York, was in charge. I have never been welcomed so warmly anywhere else. Many of the people on the trip were from the South. After the concert, some passengers suggested raising money to help the work at Tuskegee. Because of this, several scholarships were funded.

While we were in Paris, I was happily surprised to get an invitation from the people of West Virginia and the city near where I grew up. It was dated Charleston, W. Va., May 16, 1899.

The letter said:  
Professor Booker T. Washington, Paris, France: Dear Sir, many of the best people in West Virginia admire and respect you and your work. They want you to visit them when you return from Europe and share your inspiring words. We fully support this and, on behalf of the people of Charleston, warmly invite you to come so we can honor you for all you have done to honor us.

Sincerely,  
The Common Council of the City of Charleston,  
By W. Herman Smith, Mayor.
