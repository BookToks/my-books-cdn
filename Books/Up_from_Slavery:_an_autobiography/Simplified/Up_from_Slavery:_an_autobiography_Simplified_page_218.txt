After we finished, I wanted to get out of the awkward situation, so I went to the smoking room where most of the men were hanging out to see what was going on. By that time, somehow everyone on the train knew who I was. When I walked into the smoking room, I was really surprised because almost every man, most of them from Georgia, came up to introduce themselves and thank me sincerely for the work I was doing to help the South. They weren’t just trying to be nice, because they knew they wouldn’t get anything by flattering me.

From the start, I’ve tried to make the students understand that Tuskegee isn’t just my school or the officers’ school – it belongs to them too. They should care about it just as much as the trustees or teachers. I also want them to see me as their friend and advisor, not just someone watching over them.

I want the students to feel comfortable talking honestly about anything related to school life. A few times each year, I ask them to write me letters with complaints, ideas, or criticism about anything at the school. If they don’t do this, I invite them to meet me in the chapel so we can have an honest, open talk about how the school is going.
