Seeing a picture of many boys and girls studying in a schoolroom made a big impression on me. I felt like being in a school like that would be just like being in paradise.

The first time I learned that we were slaves and that people were talking about freeing us was early one morning before daylight. I woke up to my mother praying hard that Lincoln and his armies would win and that one day she and her children could be free.

I have never understood how slaves in the South, who didnâ€™t have books or newspapers, could still know so much about what was happening in the country. From the time people like Garrison and Lovejoy started fighting for freedom, slaves in the South kept up with the news.

Even though I was just a child during the Civil War, I remember hearing my mother and other slaves whispering about it late at night on the plantation.
