As I have stated, itwas awhole race trying to go to school. Fewweretooyoung,andnonetoo old, to make the attemptto learn. As fastas anykind of teachers couldbe secured, not onlywere day-schools filled, but night-schools as well. The great ambitionof the olderpeople was to try to learn to read the Bible before theydied. With this end in view, men andwomenwho were fiftyorseventy-five years oldwouldoften befoundinthe night-school. Sunday-schoolswere formedsoon afterfreedom,but the principal bookstudied in the Sunday-schoolwas the spelling-book. Day-school, night-school, Sundayschool, were always crowded, andoftenmany had to be turned away forwantof room.
 
 The opening of the schoolin the KanawhaValley, however, brought to me one ofthe keenest disappointments that I ever experienced. I had been workingin asalt-furnace for severalmonths, and my stepfather haddiscoveredthat I hada financialvalue, and so, whenthe school opened,hedecided that he could not spare me from mywork. This decision seemed to cloud myevery ambition. The disappointmentwas made all the more severe by reason ofthe fact that myplace ofworkwas where I could see the happy childrenpassingto and from school, BOYHOOD DAYS 31 mornings and afternoons.
