As I said before, it was a big effort for everyone to go to school. Nobody was too young or too old to try to learn. As soon as teachers were found, both day and night schools filled up quickly. Older people really wanted to learn how to read the Bible before they died. Because of this, men and women who were fifty or even seventy-five years old often went to night school. Sunday schools started soon after freedom, but the main book they used was the spelling book. Day schools, night schools, and Sunday schools were always full, and many people had to be turned away because there was no more space.

When a school opened in the Kanawha Valley, I felt one of the biggest disappointments ever. I had been working in a salt furnace for a few months, and my stepfather realized I was valuable for work. So, when school started, he decided he couldnâ€™t let me stop working. This made me feel like all my dreams were fading away. It was even harder because I worked where I could see happy kids going to and from school every morning and afternoon.
