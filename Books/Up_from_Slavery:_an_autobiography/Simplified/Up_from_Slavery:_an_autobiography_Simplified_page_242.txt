I had heard a lot about him. When I first met him, I was shaking because I was young and didn’t have much experience. But he took my hand warmly, said nice and encouraging things, and gave me good advice about what I should do. That moment made me see him as a great example of someone who always works hard and cares about making life better for everyone.

Mr. Morris K. Jesup, who is the treasurer of the Slater Fund, is the person I’m talking about. I don’t know any rich man with big business jobs who gives as much time, money, and thought to helping Black people improve their lives as he does. Because of him, in the past few years, industrial education has become very important and is now taken seriously.
