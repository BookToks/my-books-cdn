School would always start before I got there, and sometimes my class had already said the answers out loud. To fix this problem, I did something that most people would probably think was wrong, but since it’s true, I’ll just say it. I really believe facts are important. It rarely helps to hide the truth.

There was a big clock in a small office near the furnace. All the workers, more than a hundred of them, used that clock to know when to start and finish their work. I thought the best way for me to get to school on time was to move the clock’s hands from 8:30 to 9:00. I kept doing this every morning until the furnace boss noticed something was wrong and locked the clock in a case. I didn’t want to cause trouble. I just wanted to get to school on time.

When I finally got to school, I had two more problems. First, I saw that all the other kids were wearing hats or caps, but I didn’t have one.

Actually, I don’t remember ever wearing anything on my head before I went to school. Neither I nor anyone else had thought about needing to cover my head.
