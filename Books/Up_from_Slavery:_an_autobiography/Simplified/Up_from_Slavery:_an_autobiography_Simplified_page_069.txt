School would always be begun before I reachedit, and sometimes myclass had recited. To get around this difficulty I yielded to a temptation forwhich most people, Isuppose,will condemn me; butsince it is afact, I might aswell state it. I have great faith in the power and influence offacts. It is seldom thatanythingis permanentlygained by holdingback afact. There was a large clock in a little office inthe furnace. This clock, of course, all the hundred or more workmen depended upon to regulate their hours ofbeginning and ending the day's work. I got the ideathat theway forme to reach school on time was to move the clock hands from half-past eight up to the nine o'clock mark. This I found myself doing morning after morning, till the furnace "boss" discovered that something was wrong, and locked the clock in a case. I did not mean to inconvenience anybody. I simply meant to reach that schoolhouse in time.
 
 When, however, I found myself at the school for the first time, I also found myself confronted with two other difficulties. In the first place, I found that all of the other children wore hats or caps ontheir heads, and I had neither hatnor cap.
 
 In fact, I do not remember that up to thetime of going to school I had everworn any kind ofcovering upon my head, nor do I recall that either I BOYHOOD DAYS 33 or anybody else had even thought anything about the need ofcovering for myhead.
