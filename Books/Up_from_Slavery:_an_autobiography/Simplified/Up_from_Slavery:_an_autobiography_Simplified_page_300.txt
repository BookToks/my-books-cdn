Sergeant Carney was holding the flag while sitting on the platform. When I turned to talk to the survivors of the colored regiment and mentioned Sergeant Carney, he stood up quickly and raised the flag. I have seen many exciting moments during my speeches, but nothing was as powerful as this. For several minutes, the audience lost control because they were so moved.

After the Spanish-American War ended, there were big peace parties in many large cities. President William R. Harper from the University of Chicago, who was in charge of the invitations for the Chicago celebration, asked me to give a speech there.

I said yes and gave two speeches during the Jubilee week. The first and main one was in the Auditorium on Sunday night, October 16. This was the biggest crowd I have ever spoken to anywhere in the country. That same night, I also spoke to two other groups in different parts of the city because the main hall was full.
