" This flag Sergeant Carney held in his hands as hesatonthe platform,andwhen I turned to address the survivors of the coloured regimentwho were present, and referred to Sergeant Carney,he rose, as if by instinct, and raised the flag. It has been my privilege to witness a good many satisfactory and rather sensational demonstrations in connection with some of mypublicaddresses,but in dramatic effect I have never seen or experienced anything which equalled this. Foranumber of minutes the audience seemedto entirely losecontrol ofitself.
 
 In the general rejoicing throughout the country which followed the close of the Spanish-American war, peace celebrations were arranged in several of the large cities. I was asked by President William R. Harper, of the University of Chicago, who was chairman of the committee of invitations for the celebration to be held in the city of Chicago, to deliver one ofthe addresses at the celebration there.
 
 I accepted theinvitation, anddelivered two addresses there during theJubilee week. The first of these, andthe principal one,was given inthe Auditorium, on the evening of Sunday, October 16. This was the largest audience that I have ever addressed, in any part of the country; and besides speaking in 254 UP FROM SLAVERY the main Auditorium,I also addressed,that same evening, two overflow audiences in other parts of the city.
