We were going to sail on the Friesland, a ship from the Red Star Line, and it was a really beautiful ship. We got on board just before noon, the time we were supposed to leave. I had never been on such a big ocean ship before, and the feeling I had was hard to explain. I think it was a mix of being amazed and happy.

We were surprised in a good way to find that the captain and some of the other officers knew who we were. They were expecting us and gave us a warm welcome. There were also some passengers we knew, like Senator Sewell from New Jersey and Edward Marshall, a newspaper reporter.

I was a little worried that some passengers might not be nice to us. I had heard stories from other people of my race about bad experiences on American ships. But in our case, everyone, from the captain to the lowest worker, treated us very kindly. This kindness wasn’t just from the ship’s crew; all the passengers were friendly too.

There were quite a few men and women from the South on board, and they were just as friendly as people from other parts of the country.
