We were to sail on the Friesland, of the Red Star Line, and a beautiful vessel she was. We went on board just before noon, the hour of sailing. I had never before been on board a large ocean steamer, and the feeling which took possession of me when I found myself there is rather hard to describe. It was a feeling, I think, of awe mingled with delight. We were agreeably surprised to find that the captain, aswell as several of the other officers, not only knew who we were, butwas expectingus andgave us a pleasant greeting. There were several passengers whom we knew,including Senator Sewell, ofNew Jersey, and Edward Marshall, the newspaper correspondent.
 
 I hadjust a little fear that we would not be treated civilly by some ofthe passengers. This fearwas baseduponwhat I had heard other people of my race, who had crossed the ocean, say about unpleasant experiences in crossingthe ocean in American vessels. But in our case, from the captain down to the most humble servant, we were treated with the greatest kindness. Nor was this kindness confined to those who were connected with the steamer; it was shown by all the passengers also.
 
 There were not a few Southern men and women 276 UP FROM SLAVERY on board, and they were as cordial as those from other parts ofthe country.
