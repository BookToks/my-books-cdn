I had always regarded Europe, and London,and Paris, muchas I regardheaven. And now could it be that I was actually going to Europe?
 
 Such thoughts as thesewere constantlywith me.
 
 Two other thoughts troubled me a good deal.
 
 I feared that peoplewho heardthat Mrs. Washington and I were going to Europe might not know all the circumstances, and might get the idea that we had become, as some might say, "stuck up," andwere trying to "show off." I recalledthat from my youth I had heard it said that too often,when people of my race reached any degree of success, they were inclined to unduly exalt themselves; to try and ape the wealthy, and in so doing to lose their heads. The fear that people might think this of us haunted me a good deal. Then, too, I could not see howmy conscience would permit me to spare the time from mywork and be happy.
 
 It seemed mean and selfish in me to be taking a vacation while others were at work, and while there was so much that needed to be done. From the time I could remember, I had always been atwork, and I did not see how I could spend three or four months indoing nothing. The factwas that I did not know how to take a vacation.
 
 Mrs. Washington had much the same difficulty 274 UP FROM SLAVERY in getting away, butshewas anxious to go because she thought that I needed the rest.
