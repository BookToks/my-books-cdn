I had always thought of Europe, especially London and Paris, like they were as amazing as heaven. And now, could it really be that I was actually going to Europe?

I kept thinking about this all the time.

But two other things worried me a lot.

I was scared that if people heard Mrs. Washington and I were going to Europe, they might not understand why. They might think we were acting "stuck up" or trying to "show off." Since I was young, I had heard that sometimes when people of my race do well, they act like they're better than others or try to copy rich people and lose their way. I didn’t want people to think that about us. Also, I didn’t think I could enjoy the trip because I felt guilty.

It felt wrong and selfish to take a vacation when others were working and there was so much to do. I had always been working since I could remember, and I didn’t know how to spend three or four months doing nothing. The truth was, I didn’t know how to take a vacation.

Mrs. Washington had a hard time getting time off too, but she really wanted to go because she thought I needed a break.
