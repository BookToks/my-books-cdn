Making bricks was hard and messy, and it was tough to get the students to help.  

When it came to brickmaking, the students really didn’t want to do any hard work that wasn’t about books. It wasn’t fun to stand in a muddy pit for hours with mud up to your knees. More than one person got fed up and quit the school.  

We tried digging in different places before we found a spot with good clay for bricks. I thought making bricks was easy, but I quickly learned it needed special skills, especially when burning the bricks. After a lot of work, we made about twenty-five thousand bricks and put them in a kiln to burn.  

The first kiln didn’t work because it wasn’t built or fired right. We started building a second kiln, but it also failed. This made it even harder to get students to help. Some teachers who had experience from Hampton stepped in to help, and we managed to get a third kiln ready to burn.  

Burning the bricks took about a week. Near the end of the week, when it looked like we would have thousands of good bricks soon, the kiln suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night.
