It was also interesting to see how many big books some of them had studied, and how many fancy subjects they said they knew well. The bigger the book and the longer the subject name, the more proud they felt about it. Some had studied Latin, and a few even Greek. They thought this made them special.

One of the saddest things I saw during my month of travel was a young man who had been to some high school. He was sitting in a small cabin, with grease on his clothes, dirt everywhere, and weeds in the yard, studying a French grammar book.

The students who came first liked to memorize long and hard "rules" in grammar and math, but didnâ€™t think much about using these rules in their daily lives. One subject they liked to talk about and said they had mastered was "banking and discount" in arithmetic. But I soon found out that neither they nor most people in the area where they lived had ever even had a bank account.
