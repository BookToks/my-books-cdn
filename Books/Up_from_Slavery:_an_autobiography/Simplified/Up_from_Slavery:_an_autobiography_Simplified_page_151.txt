The job ahead of me didnâ€™t look very promising. It felt like trying to make bricks without straw. The Black people were very happy and always ready to help in any way to get the school started.

My first job was to find a place to open the school. After looking carefully around town, the best place I could find was a run-down shack near the Black Methodist church, and the church itself would be used as a meeting room. Both the church and the shack were in really bad shape. I remember that during the first months of teaching in this building, it was so broken that whenever it rained, one of the older students would stop his lessons and kindly hold an umbrella over me while I listened to the other students. I also remember that more than once, my landlady held an umbrella over me while I ate breakfast.

When I came to Alabama, the Black people were very interested in politics. They really wanted me to join them in their political efforts in every way. They seemed a little suspicious of strangers about this.
