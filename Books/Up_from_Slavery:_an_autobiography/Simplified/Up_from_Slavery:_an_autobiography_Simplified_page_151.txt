The task before medid not seem a veryencouraging one. It seemed much like makingbricks without straw. Thecoloured peoplewere overjoyed,andwereconstantlyofferingtheir services inanyway inwhich they could be of assistance in getting the school started.
 
 My first taskwas to find a placeinwhich to open the school. After looking thetownoverwithsome care,the most suitable place that could be secured seemed to be a rather dilapidated shantynear the colouredMethodistchurch,togetherwiththechurch itself as a sort of assembly-room. Boththechurch and the shantywere in about as bad condition as was possible. I recall thatduringthe first months of school that Itaught in this building it was in such poor repair that,wheneveritrained,oneofthe older students would verykindlyleave his lessons and hold an umbrella over me while Iheard the recitations of the others. I remember, also, that on more than one occasion my landlady held an umbrella over me while I atebreakfast.
