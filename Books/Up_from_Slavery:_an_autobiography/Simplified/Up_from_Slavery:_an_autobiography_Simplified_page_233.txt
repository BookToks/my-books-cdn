Sometimes, when I felt really let down during the week because the people I expected help from didn’t help me, someone unexpected would step in and offer generous support.

I remember one time I heard about a man who lived about two miles outside Stamford, Connecticut. I thought he might be interested in what we were doing at Tuskegee if I explained our situation. On a very cold and stormy day, I walked two miles to see him. After some trouble, I finally got to talk to him. He listened with some interest but didn’t give me anything.

I felt like the three hours I spent seeing him were wasted. Still, I had done my duty. If I hadn’t gone, I would have felt bad for not trying.

Two years later, a letter arrived at Tuskegee from this man. It said: "I’m sending you a New York draft for ten thousand dollars to help your work."
