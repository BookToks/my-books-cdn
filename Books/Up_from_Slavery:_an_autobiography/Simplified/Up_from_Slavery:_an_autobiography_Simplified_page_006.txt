UP FROM SLAVERY

I was born a slave. Life was really hard for me and my family. We didn’t have many chances to learn or do much.

After slavery ended, I wanted to get an education. I worked really hard to go to school even though it was tough.

I believe that learning is the key to a better life. If you keep trying and don’t give up, you can achieve your goals.

My story shows how someone can rise above difficult times and succeed with hard work and hope.
