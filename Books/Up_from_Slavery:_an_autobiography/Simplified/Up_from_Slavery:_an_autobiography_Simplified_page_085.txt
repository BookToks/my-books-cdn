Somehow, I stayed warm by walking around, so I made it through the night. I was so focused on getting to Hampton that I didn’t have time to be mad at the hotel owner.

I got rides from wagons and cars, and by walking too. After a few days, I finally reached Richmond, Virginia, which is about eighty-two miles from Hampton. 

When I got there, I was tired, hungry, and dirty. It was late at night. I had never been in a big city before, and that made me feel even worse. I had no money and didn’t know anyone in Richmond. I also didn’t know where to go because I wasn’t used to city life.

I tried to find a place to stay, but everywhere wanted money. I didn’t have any.

With nothing else to do, I walked the streets. I saw many food stands with fried chicken and apple pies looking really good. At that moment, I felt like I would give up everything I hoped to have one day just to get a chicken leg or a pie. But I couldn’t get any food at all.
