In someway I managed to keep warm by walking about, and so got through the night. My whole soul was so bent upon reaching Hampton that I didnot have time to cherish any bitterness toward the hotel-keeper.
 
 By walking, begging rides both in wagons and % in the cars, in someway, after a number of days, I reached the city of Richmond, Virginia, about eighty-two miles from Hampton. When I reached.
 
 there, tired, hungry, and dirty, it was late in the night. I had neverbeen in a large city, and this rather added to my misery. When I reached Richmond, I was completely out ofmoney. I had not a single acquaintance in the place, and, being unused to cityways, I did not know where to go.
 
 I applied at several places for lodging, but they all wanted money, and that was what I did not have.
 
 Knowing nothing else better to do, I walked the streets. In doing this I passed by many foodstands where fried chicken and half-moon apple pies were piled high and made to present a most tempting appearance. At that time it seemed to me that I would have promised all that I expected to possess in the futureto have gotten hold of one ofthose chicken legs or one of those pies. But I couldnotgeteither ofthese, noranything else to eat.
