CHAPTER XI MAKING THEIR BEDS BEFORE THEY COULD LIE ON THEM

A little later in the school's history, General J. F. B. Marshall, who was the Treasurer of the Hampton Institute, came to visit us. He believed in us enough to lend us the first two hundred and fifty dollars to help pay for the farm. He stayed with us for a week and looked carefully at everything. He seemed happy with how we were doing and sent back positive and encouraging reports to Hampton.

Soon after, Miss Mary F. Mackie, the teacher who had given me the tough exam when I started at Hampton, came to see us. Then later, General Armstrong himself visited.

At the time these Hampton friends visited, the number of teachers at Tuskegee had grown a lot. Most of the new teachers had graduated from the Hampton Institute. We gave our Hampton friends, especially General Armstrong, a warm welcome. They were all surprised and pleased at how fast the school had grown in such a short time.
