I don’t know two men, one who used to own slaves and one who used to be a slave, whose advice and opinions I would trust more about the life and growth of the Tuskegee school than these two men.

I have always thought that Mr. Adams got a lot of his strong thinking skills from learning three different trades by working with his hands during slavery. If you go to any Southern town today and ask for the most respected and trustworthy Black man in the community, I believe that five times out of ten, you’ll be told it’s a Black man who learned a trade during slavery.

On the first day the school opened, thirty students showed up to join. I was the only teacher. The students were about half boys and half girls. Most of them lived in Macon County, where Tuskegee is located, and where it is the main town.

Many more students wanted to come to the school, but it was decided to only accept those who were older than fifteen and had some education already. Most of the thirty students were public school teachers, and some were almost forty years old. Some of the teachers brought their former students with them, and it was funny to see that in several cases the student was placed in a higher class than their old teacher.
