When I was signing up the students, I noticed almost all of them had one or more middle initials in their names.

When I asked what the "J" stood for in John J. Jones, they told me it was part of his full name. Most students wanted to get an education because they thought it would help them make more money as teachers.

Even though I said these things about them, I have never seen a group of young men and women more eager and willing to learn. They were ready to learn the right things as soon as someone showed them what was right. I wanted to give them a strong and complete start with their books.

I soon found out that most of them only knew a little about the big subjects they had studied. For example, they could find the Desert of Sahara or the capital of China on a fake globe, but the girls didnâ€™t know where the knives and forks should go on a real dinner table or where to put the bread and meat.

I had to be very brave to take a student who had been studying things like cube roots and "banking and discount" and tell him the smartest thing to do first was to really learn the multiplication table well.
