At Hampton, the students were always trying hard to help themselves through different kinds of work. This effort was really important for building their character. 

The students at the other school didn’t seem to be as independent. They cared more about how they looked on the outside. In short, they didn’t seem to be starting from the basics or building a strong foundation like the Hampton students did. 

They knew more about Latin and Greek when they finished school, but they seemed to understand less about real life and the challenges they would face at home. Because they had lived in comfortable places for many years, they were less likely than Hampton students to go to poor country areas in the South. They didn’t want to do work for the people there, and instead, they were more likely to take jobs like hotel waiters or Pullman-car porters for their future.

When I was a student in Washington, the city was full of Black people, many of whom had just come from the South. A lot of them moved to Washington because they thought they could live an easy life there.
