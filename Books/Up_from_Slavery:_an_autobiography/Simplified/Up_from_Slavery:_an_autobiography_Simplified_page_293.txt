When I opened my eyes, I would tip the plate one way and then the other to spread the molasses all over it. I really believed that there would be more molasses and that it would last longer if I spread it out like that. My memories of those Sunday morning breakfasts are so strong that it would be hard for anyone to convince me there isn’t more molasses on a plate when it’s spread out than when it’s all in one little corner—if a plate even has a corner. Anyway, I have never believed in putting syrup in a corner. 

My share of the syrup was usually about two spoonfuls, and those two spoonfuls were way better to me than a fancy fourteen-course dinner where I have to give a speech afterward.

After speaking to business men, I like speaking to a group of Southern people best, whether they’re Black or White, together or alone. Their excitement and responses are always a joy. The “amens” and “that’s the truth” from Black folks encourage any speaker to do their best. 

I think the next best group to speak to is a college audience.
