Now I was able to ride the whole way on the train. I kept thinking about how different this was from my first trip to Hampton.

I think I can say, without sounding full of myself, that not many people change as much as I did in five years.

At Hampton, the teachers and students welcomed me warmly. I learned that while I was away, the school had been getting better every year at meeting the real needs of our people. Both the industrial classes and the regular academic classes had improved a lot. The school wasn’t copying any other school. Every change was made by General Armstrong to help our people in the best way at that time.

Often, in missions and education for less developed groups, people try to do what was done a hundred years ago or what other schools far away are doing. They try to fit everyone into the same educational mold, not thinking about each person’s situation or what they really need.
