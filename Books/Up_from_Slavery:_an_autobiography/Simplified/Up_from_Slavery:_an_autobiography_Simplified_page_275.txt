Assoon as I met Mr. Cleveland I became impressed with his simplicity, greatness, andrugged honesty. I have met himmany times sincethen,both at publicfunctions and at his private residence in Princeton, and the more I see of him the more I admire him. When hevisited the Negro BuildinginAtlantaheseemed to give himself up wholly, for that hour, to the coloured people. He seemed to be as careful to shake hands with some old coloured "auntie" clad partially in rags, and to take as much pleasure in doing so, as if he weregreeting some millionnaire.
 
 Many ofthe coloured people took advantage ofthe occasion togethim towrite his name in a book or on aslip ofpaper. Hewas as careful and patient in doing this as ifhewere putting his signature to somegreat statedocument.
 
 Mr. Cleveland has notonly shown his friendship formeinmanypersonalways,but has always consented to do anything I have asked of him for our school. This he has done, whether itwas tomake apersonal donation ortousehis influence insecuring the donations ofothers. Judging frommypersonal acquaintance with Mr. Cleveland, I do not believe that he is conscious ofpossessing anycolour prejudice. He is too great for that. In my con THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS 229 tactwith people I find that, as arule, itis only the little, narrow people who live for themselves, who never read good books, who do not travel, who never open up their souls in away to permit them to come into contact with other soulsâ€”with the great outside world.
