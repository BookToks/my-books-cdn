As soon as I met Mr. Cleveland, I was impressed by how simple, great, and honest he was. I have seen him many times since then, both at public events and at his home in Princeton, and the more I see him, the more I respect him.

When he visited the Negro Building in Atlanta, he seemed to fully focus on the Black people there. He was just as careful to shake hands with an old Black woman wearing torn clothes as he was when greeting a millionaire.

Many Black people used the chance to get him to write his name in books or on pieces of paper. He was just as careful and patient signing these as if he were signing an important government document.

Mr. Cleveland has shown his friendship to me in many personal ways. He has always agreed to help with anything I asked for our school. He has done this by giving money himself or helping to get others to donate.

From knowing Mr. Cleveland personally, I don’t think he has any color prejudice. He is too great for that. In my experience, it’s usually small-minded people who are selfish, don’t read good books, don’t travel, and don’t open their hearts to others who have prejudice.
