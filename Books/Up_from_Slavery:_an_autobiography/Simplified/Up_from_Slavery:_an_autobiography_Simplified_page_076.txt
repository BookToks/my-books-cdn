They soon stop wanting to do anything except keep working as coal miners.

Back then, and later when I was a young man, I used to imagine how a white boy would feel and what dreams he would have if nothing ever held him back. I used to wish I was that white boy who could become a Congressman, Governor, Bishop, or President just because of his race and birth. I would think about how I would start at the bottom and keep going up until I reached the top.

But later, I admit I didn’t envy the white boy as much as before. I learned that success isn’t just about the position someone reaches in life but about the challenges they overcome while trying to succeed. From this view, I almost think that being a Black boy, born into an unpopular race, can actually be a kind of advantage in real life.
