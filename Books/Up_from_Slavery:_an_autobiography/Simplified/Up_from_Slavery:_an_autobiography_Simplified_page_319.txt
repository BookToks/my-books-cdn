It feels really good and relaxing to get away from big crowds, handshakes, and traveling, and just be home, even if only for a short time.

Another thing I really enjoy at Tuskegee is meeting our students, teachers, and their families every evening at 8:30 in the chapel for devotional exercises. It’s the last thing we do before going to bed. It’s amazing to stand on the platform and see eleven or twelve hundred eager young men and women. It makes me feel lucky to help guide them to a better and more useful life.

In the spring of 1899, something happened that surprised me a lot. Some kind ladies in Boston planned a public meeting to support Tuskegee at the Hollis Street Theatre. Many important people from Boston, both Black and white, came to the meeting. Bishop Lawrence was in charge.

Besides my speech, Mr. Paul Lawrence Dunbar read some of his poems, and Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois shared an original story.

Some people at the meeting noticed I looked very tired. Not long after, one of the interested ladies casually asked me if I had ever been to Europe.
