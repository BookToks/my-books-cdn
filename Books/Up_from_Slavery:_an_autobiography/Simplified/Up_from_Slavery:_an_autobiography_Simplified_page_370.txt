Right now, I am in Richmond as a guest of the Black people in the city. They asked me to come and give a speech last night to both Black and white people at the Academy of Music, the biggest and nicest place for events in the city.

This was the first time Black people were allowed to use this hall. The day before I arrived, the City Council decided to all come to the meeting to hear me speak. The state Legislature, which includes the House of Delegates and the Senate, also agreed to come together.

In front of hundreds of Black people, many important white citizens, the City Council, the state Legislature, and other state officials, I gave my speech. It was a message full of hope and encouragement. From the bottom of my heart, I thanked both Black and white people for welcoming me back to the state where I was born.
