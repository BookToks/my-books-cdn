This time I am in Richmond as theguest of the colouredpeopleofthecity; andcameat theirrequest todeliver an address last nightto both races in the Academy of Music, the largest and finest audience room in the city. This was the first time that the coloured people had ever been permitted to use this hall. The day before I came, the City Council passed avote to attend the meeting in a body to hear me speak. The state Legislature, including the House of Delegates and the Senate, also passed a unanimous vote to attend in abody. In the presence of hundreds of coloured people, many distinguished white citizens, the City Council, the state Legislature,and state officials, I delivered my message, which was one of hope and cheer; and from the bottom ofmy heart Ithankedboth races for this welcome back to the state that gave me birth.
