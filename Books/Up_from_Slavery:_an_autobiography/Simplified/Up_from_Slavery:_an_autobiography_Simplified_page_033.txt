As Black people in the South become financially independent, they start to play an important role in Southern life, and white people notice this. This change happens naturally and isn’t forced. Southern white people not only notice it but also try to do the same by teaching poor white communities. Because of this, schools in the South are becoming more connected to real life than anywhere else in the country. Education isn’t just a system or idea; it’s about learning how to live and work.

Saying that Mr. Washington has earned the respect of thoughtful Southern white men means he has done a smart and practical job. No plan to help freed Black people could work if it went against what Southern white people thought. Winning their support and changing their opinions was important, and he did this very well. Because of that, the South truly respects him. He once told me he was thankful for the day he could respect a Southern white man just as much as a Northern one.
