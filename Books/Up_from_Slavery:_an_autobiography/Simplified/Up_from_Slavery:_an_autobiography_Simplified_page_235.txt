From the beginning ofour work to the present I have always had the feeling, and lose no opportunity to impress our teachers with the same idea, that the school will always be supported in proportion as the inside of the institution is kept clean and pure and wholesome.
 
 Thefirst time I ever sawthe late Collis P. Huntington, the great railroad man,hegaveme two dollarsfor our school. The lasttime Isaw him,which was a fewmonths before he died, he gave me fifty thousanddollars toward our endowmentfund. Between these two gifts therewere others ofgenerous proportions which came every yearfrom both Mr.
