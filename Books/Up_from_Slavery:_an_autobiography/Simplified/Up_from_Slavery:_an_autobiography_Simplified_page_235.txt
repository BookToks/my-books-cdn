From the start of our work until now, I have always felt—and I always tell our teachers—that the school will only get support if the inside of the school is kept clean, pure, and healthy.

The first time I met the late Collis P. Huntington, the famous railroad man, he gave me two dollars for our school. The last time I saw him, a few months before he died, he gave me fifty thousand dollars for our endowment fund. Between these two gifts, he and his wife gave other big donations every year.

Some people might say it was just luck that we got the fifty thousand dollars. But no, it wasn’t luck. It was hard work. Nothing worth having comes without working hard.

When Mr. Huntington gave me the first two dollars, I didn’t blame him for not giving more. Instead, I decided to prove to him with real results that we deserved bigger gifts. For twelve years, I worked hard to convince Mr. Huntington.
