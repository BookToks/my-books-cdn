The committee was made up of about twenty-five important and powerful white men from Georgia. All the members were white men except Bishop Grant, Bishop Gaines, and me. The Mayor and some other city and state officials spoke first.

After them, the two Black bishops spoke.

I was the last person to speak. I had never spoken before such a committee before, and I had never given a speech in the nation’s capital. I wasn’t sure what to say or how my speech would be received. I don’t remember exactly what I said, but I tried my best to clearly and seriously tell the committee that if Congress wanted to help end racial problems in the South and bring the two races closer, it should support the growth and progress of both races in every right way. I said the Atlanta Exposition would be a chance for both races to show how much they had improved since freedom and would encourage them to keep making progress.
