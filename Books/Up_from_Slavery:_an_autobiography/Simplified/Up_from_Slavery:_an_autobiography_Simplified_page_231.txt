Going from door to door and office to office is hard, unpleasant, and tiring. But it also has some good sides.

This kind of work lets you understand people really well. It also gives you a chance to meet some of the best people in the world—I should say the very best people.

If you look around the country, you’ll see that the most helpful and powerful people are those who care deeply about organizations that try to make the world a better place.

Once, when I was in Boston, I went to the home of a rich lady. I was let into the entryway and sent up my card. While I waited, her husband came in and asked me sharply what I wanted. When I explained why I was there, he acted even more rude and upset. I left before the lady could answer.

Just a few blocks away, I visited another man who welcomed me warmly. He wrote me a generous check and said, "I am so grateful to you, Mr." before I could even thank him.
