This was the first time I had ever heard about a school or college that seemed fancier than the small colored school in our town.

In the dark mine, I quietly moved as close as I could to the two men who were talking.

I heard one man tell the other that the school was made for people like me, and that poor but deserving students could work to pay some or all of their costs. At the same time, they could learn a skill or a trade.

As they kept talking about the school, it sounded like the best place ever. It seemed even better than Heaven to me then. The men were talking about the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in Virginia.
