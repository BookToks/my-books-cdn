PREFACE  

This book comes from a series of articles about my life that were published one after another in the Outlook magazine. While they were being published, I was surprised by how many people from all over the country asked me to save the articles in a book. I am very thankful to the Outlook for letting me do this.  

I have tried to tell a simple and clear story without adding anything extra. I’m sorry if I didn’t do it perfectly. Most of my time and energy goes to managing the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute and raising money to support it.  

A lot of what I wrote was done on trains, in hotels, or at railroad stations while I was waiting for trains or during the little free time I had at Tuskegee.
