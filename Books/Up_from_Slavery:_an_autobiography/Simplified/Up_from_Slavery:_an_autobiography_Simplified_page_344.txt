A few weeks after General Armstrong died, I got the chance to meet one of the best and kindest men I have ever known. His name is Rev. Dr. Hollis B. Frissell. He is now the Principal of the Hampton Institute and took over after General Armstrong.

Dr. Frissell is a strong and clear leader. Because of him, Hampton has done very well and helped many people, just like General Armstrong wanted. Dr. Frissell always tries to stay humble and not take the credit for himself. He wants to keep the focus on General Armstrong and the work they are doing.

Many people have asked me what the biggest surprise in my life has been. I can answer that without much thought.

It was a letter I got one Sunday morning while I was sitting on the porch of my home in Tuskegee with my wife and three kids. The letter said: HARVARD UNIVERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, MAY 28, 1896.

PRESIDENT BOOKER T. WASHINGTON, My Dear Sir: Harvard University wants to give you an honorary degree at our upcoming graduation. But we only give degrees to people who can be here in person. Our graduation is on June 24, and we would like you to be here from about noon to five in the afternoon.
