My wife also graduated from the Hampton Institute.

She worked hard for the school while also taking care of our home. Sadly, she died in May 1884. We had one child together, Portia M. Washington.

From the beginning, my wife spent a lot of time and energy on the schoolâ€™s work. She shared all my hopes and goals. But she died before she could see what the school was meant to become.
