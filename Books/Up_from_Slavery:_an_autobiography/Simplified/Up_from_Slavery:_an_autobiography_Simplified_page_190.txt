My wife was also a graduate of the Hampton Institute.
 
 After earnest and constantwork in the interests of the school, together with her housekeeping duties, my wife passed away in May, 1884. One child, Portia M. Washington, was born during our marriage.
 
 From the first, my wife most earnestly devoted her thoughts and time to theworkof the school, andwas completely one with me in every interest and ambition. She passed away, however, before she had an opportunity ofseeingwhat the school was designed to be.
