That morning, lots of people were complaining because breakfast was a total mess. One girl didn’t get any breakfast at all. She went to the well to get some water to drink instead. But when she got there, the rope was broken, so she couldn’t get any water.

She turned away from the well and said in a very sad voice, not knowing I could hear her, "We can’t even get water to drink at this school." I think no other comment ever made me feel more discouraged than that one.

Another time, Mr. Bedford, who is one of our trustees and a good friend of the school, was visiting. He stayed in a room right above the dining room. Early in the morning, he woke up because two boys downstairs were arguing loudly. They were fighting over whose turn it was to use the coffee cup. One boy won by proving he hadn’t been able to use the cup for three mornings in a row.

But little by little, with patience and hard work, we made things better and brought order out of the mess. This is true for any problem if you keep trying with patience, wisdom, and real effort.
