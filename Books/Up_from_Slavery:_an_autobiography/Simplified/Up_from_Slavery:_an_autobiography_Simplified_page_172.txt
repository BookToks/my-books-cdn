But how were we going to get it? The price was very low—only five hundred dollars—but we had no money. We were new in town and didn’t have any credit. The landowner said we could live there if we paid two hundred and fifty dollars first. We had to pay the other two hundred and fifty dollars within a year. Even though five hundred dollars was cheap for the land, it was still a lot of money when you didn’t have any.

During this hard time, I got up my courage and wrote to my friend General J. F. B. Marshall. He was the Treasurer of the Hampton Institute. I explained the situation and asked if he could lend me two hundred and fifty dollars, trusting me to pay him back. A few days later, he replied that he couldn’t use the Institute’s money to help me, but he would gladly lend me the money from his own personal funds.

I have to say, getting this money was a big surprise and made me very happy. Until then, I had never had as much as one hundred dollars at once. The loan I asked General Marshall for felt like a huge amount of money to me.
