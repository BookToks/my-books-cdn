But how werewe toget it? The price asked for itwas very little—only five hundred dollars—but we had no money, and we were strangers in the town and had no credit. The owner of the land agreed to let us occupythe place ifwecouldmake a paymentoftwo hundred and fiftydollarsdown,with theunderstandingthattheremainingtwohundredand fifty dollars must be paidwithin ayear. Although five hundred dollarswas cheap forthe land,it was a largesumwhen onedid nothave any part ofit.
 
 Inthe midst ofthe difficulty I summoned agreat deal of courage and wrote to my friend General J. F. B. Marshall, the Treasurer ofthe Hampton Institute, putting the situation before him and beseeching him to lend me thetwo hundredand fifty dollars on my own personal responsibility. Within a fewdays a replycame to the effect that he had no authority to lend me money belonging to the Hampton Institute, but that hewould gladly lend me the amountneededfrom his own personal funds.
 
 I confess that the securing of this money in this waywas agreat surprise to me, as well as asource of gratification. Up to that time I neverhad had inmy possession so much money as one hundred dollars at a time,and the loanwhich I had asked 130 UP FROM SLAVERY General Marshall for seemed a tremendously large sum to me.
