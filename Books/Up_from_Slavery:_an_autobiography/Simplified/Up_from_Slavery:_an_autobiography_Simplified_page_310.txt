I think it’s really useful to be able to sleep well anytime and anywhere. I’ve trained myself so I can take a short nap of fifteen or twenty minutes and wake up feeling fresh and ready.

I always try to finish my work before stopping for the day. There’s one time I don’t do this though. When I have a really hard problem to solve—especially one that feels emotional—I like to wait and sleep on it for a night. Sometimes, I wait until I can talk it over with my wife and friends.

When it comes to reading, the most time I get to read is when I’m traveling on trains or cars. I really enjoy newspapers because they’re fun and relaxing to read.

The only problem is I read too many newspapers.

I’m not very interested in fiction. Sometimes I have to force myself to read popular novels. What I really like to read are biographies. I want to make sure I’m reading about real people or real events. I think I’ve read almost every book and article written about Abraham Lincoln. In literature, he’s like my hero.

Out of the twelve months in a year, I guess I spend about six months away from Tuskegee on average.
