I worked as a waiter at a hotel several times before.  

When the hotel season ended, I went back to my old home in Malden and was chosen to teach at the colored school there. This was the start of one of the happiest times in my life.  

I felt like I could help the people in my hometown live better lives. I knew that just teaching from books wasn’t enough for the young people there. I started working at eight in the morning and usually didn’t finish until ten at night.  

Besides regular teaching, I showed the students how to comb their hair and keep their hands, faces, and clothes clean. I also taught them how to use a toothbrush and take baths properly. I watched closely how using a toothbrush helped, and I believe it’s one of the most important things that changes people’s lives.  

Many older boys and girls, as well as men and women who worked during the day but wanted to learn, asked for more education. So, I started a night school. It was full every night, with about as many students as the day school.  

Some of the men and women were over fifty years old, and their strong desire to learn was very touching.
