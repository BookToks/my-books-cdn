HELPING OTHERS 75 ofbeing a guest in this hotel several times since Iwas awaiter there.
 
 At the close ofthehotel season I returned tomy formerhomeinMalden,andwaselected to teach the coloured school at that place. This was thebegin.
 
 ningofoneofthehappiestperiodsofmylife. I now feltthatI had the opportunitytohelp thepeople of myhome towntoahigher life. I feltfromthe first thatmere bookeducationwasnot all thattheyoung people ofthat town needed. I began my work at eighto'clock inthe morning, and, as a rule, it did notenduntilten o'clock at night. In addition to theusual routineofteaching, I taughtthe pupils to comb their hair, and tokeeptheir hands and faces clean, as well as their clothing. I gave special attention to teaching them the proper use of the tooth-brush andthebath. Inallmyteaching I have watched carefully the influence of the tooth-brush, and I am convinced that there are few single agencies ofcivilizationthat aremore far-reaching.
 
 There were so many of the older boys and girls in the town, as well as men and women, who had to work in the daytime but still were craving an opportunity for some education,that I soonopened a night-school. From the first, this was crowded every night, being about as large as the school that I taught in the day. Theefforts ofsome of 76 UP FROM SLAVERY themenandwomen,who inmany cases were over fifty years ofage, tolearn,were in some cases very pathetic.
