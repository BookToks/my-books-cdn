Later in my life, I found out that my mother gave me the name "Booker Taliaferro" right after I was born. But somehow, part of my name got lost and was forgotten for a long time. When I learned about it, I started using it again and made my full name "Booker Taliaferro Washington." I think not many people in our country have had the chance to choose their own name like I did.

Sometimes, I imagine what it would be like to be born into a family with a famous history that goes back hundreds of years. A family that not only has a well-known name but also money and a nice home. But I also think that if I had that, and belonged to a more popular group, I might have been tempted to rely on my family’s past and skin color instead of working hard myself.

Years ago, I decided that since I didn’t have a family history like that, I would make my own story. I wanted to leave something my children could be proud of and something that would push them to work even harder.

People should not judge Black people, especially young Black people, too quickly or too harshly.
