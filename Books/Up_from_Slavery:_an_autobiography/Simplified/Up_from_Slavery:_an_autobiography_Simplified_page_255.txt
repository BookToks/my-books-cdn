I tried to explain that while Black people should not be stopped unfairly from voting, just fighting for political rights wouldnâ€™t be enough to help them. Behind the right to vote, they also needed to have property, work skills, money sense, intelligence, and good character. No group could do well in the long run without these things.

I said that if Congress gave money for this, it could do something really helpful for both Black and white people. This was the first big chance like this since the Civil War ended.

I spoke for about fifteen or twenty minutes, and I was surprised when the Georgia committee and the members of Congress there gave me strong congratulations after my speech.

The Committee all agreed to support the bill, and a few days later, Congress approved it. When the bill passed, it made sure the Atlanta Exposition would be successful.

Soon after I went to Washington, the Exposition leaders decided it would be a good idea to build a big, nice building just for showing how much Black people had improved since gaining freedom.
