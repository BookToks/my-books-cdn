Once I got there, I knew I could be really helpful as a janitor so I could somehow get through the school year.

Three weeks before school started at Hampton, I was happy to get a letter from my good friend Miss Mary F. Mackie, the lady principal. She asked me to come back two weeks early to help clean the buildings and get things ready for the new school year. This was exactly the chance I wanted.

It gave me a chance to earn credit in the treasurerâ€™s office. So I headed to Hampton right away.

During those two weeks, I learned a lesson I will never forget. Miss Mackie came from one of the oldest and most respected families in the North. But for two weeks, she worked right beside me cleaning windows, dusting rooms, making beds, and more. She believed everything had to be perfect for school to start, so she took great pride in cleaning the windows herself. She did this work every year I was at Hampton.

At the time, it was hard for me to understand how a woman with her education and social status could enjoy doing such work to help improve the lives of people like me.
