When I left school at the end of my firstyear, I owed the institution sixteen dollars that Ihad not been able to work out. Itwas mygreatest ambition during the summer tosave money enough with which to pay thisdebt. I felt that this was a debt ofhonour, and that I could hardly bring myself to the point ofeven trying to enter school againtill it was paid. I economized in everywaythat I could think of-did my ownwashing, and went without necessary garments â€”butstill I found my summer vacation ending and I did not have the sixteen dollars.
 
 Oneday, during the lastweek of my stayin the restaurant, I found under one of the tables a crisp, new ten-dollar bill. I couldhardlycontain myself, Iwas so happy. As it was not my place of business I felt it to be the proper thing to show the moneyto the proprietor. This I did. He seemed as glad as I was, but he coollyexplained to me that, as itwas his place of business,he had a right to keep the money, and he proceededto do so. This, I confess, was another pretty hard blowto me. I will not say that I became discouraged, for as I now look back over my life I do not recall that I ever becamediscouraged over anything that I set 66 UP FROM SLAVERY out to accomplish.
