When I left school at the end of my first year, I owed the school sixteen dollars that I couldn’t pay. My biggest goal during the summer was to save enough money to pay this debt. I felt it was very important to pay it, and I didn’t even want to think about going back to school until I did. I tried to save money in every way I could—I did my own laundry and didn’t buy clothes I needed—but still, my summer was ending and I didn’t have the sixteen dollars.

One day, during the last week I worked at the restaurant, I found a crisp, new ten-dollar bill under a table. I was so happy I could hardly believe it. Since it wasn’t my workplace, I thought it was right to show the money to the owner. I did, and he seemed just as happy as I was, but then he told me that because it was his business, he had the right to keep the money. And he did. This was another tough disappointment for me. 

I won’t say I gave up, though, because looking back, I don’t remember ever getting discouraged when I really wanted to achieve something.
