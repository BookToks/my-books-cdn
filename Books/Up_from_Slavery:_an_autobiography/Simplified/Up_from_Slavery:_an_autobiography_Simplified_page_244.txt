The night-school, started in this manner,has grown until there are at present four hundred and fifty-seven students enrolled in it alone.
 
 There could hardly be a more severe test of a student's worth than this branch of the Institute's work. It is largely because it furnishes such a good opportunitytotestthe backbone ofa student that I place such high value upon our nightschool. Any onewho iswilling towork ten hours adayat the brick-yard,or in the laundry, through oneor two years, in orderthat he or she may have the privilege ofstudying academic branches for two hours in the evening, has enough bottom towarrant being further educated.
 
 After the student has left the night-school he enters the day-school, where he takes academic branches four days in a week, and works at his trade two days. Besides this he usuallyworks at his trade duringthe three summer months. As a rule, after a studenthas succeeded in going through the night-school test, he finds away to finish the 198 UP FROM SLAVERY regular course in industrial and academic training.
