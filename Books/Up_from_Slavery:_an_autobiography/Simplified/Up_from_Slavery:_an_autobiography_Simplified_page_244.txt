The night school started small but now has 457 students enrolled.  

This part of the Institute is a really tough test for students. I think the night school is very important because it shows how strong and determined a student is. Anyone who is willing to work ten hours a day at a brick-yard or laundry for one or two years just to study academic subjects for two hours in the evening has enough strength to keep learning.  

After finishing night school, the student goes to day school. There, they study academic subjects four days a week and work at their trade two days. Usually, they also work at their trade during the three summer months.  

Most students who pass the night school test find a way to complete the full course of industrial and academic training.
