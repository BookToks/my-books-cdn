We failed three times in a row.

After the last kiln broke, I didn’t have any money left to try again. Most teachers told me to just stop trying to make bricks.

In the middle of my problems, I remembered a watch I had gotten years before. I took it to a pawnshop in Montgomery, which was nearby, and got fifteen dollars for it. I used that money to start the brickmaking experiment again.

I went back to Tuskegee and, with the fifteen dollars, I encouraged the tired and discouraged team to try one more time. This time, I’m happy to say, we succeeded. Before I got any more money, the time on my watch ran out, and I never saw it again. But I never regretted losing it.

Now, brickmaking is a big deal at the school. Last season, our students made 1,200,000 high-quality bricks that could be sold anywhere. Also, many young men have learned how to make bricks by hand and with machines, and now they work in this business all over the South.
