Trying to stop the world's progress is like trying to stop a big train by standing on the tracks. The world is always moving forward, giving people more knowledge, culture, skills, freedom, and kindness.

I gave a speech in Madison to the National Educational Association, and it made me known in the North. After that, I got chances to speak to audiences there.

But I really wanted to speak directly to a Southern white audience. In 1893, there was a big meeting of Christian Workers in Atlanta, Georgia, which seemed like a good chance.

At first, I thought I couldn't go because I had plans in Boston. But after checking my schedule, I saw I could take a train from Boston to Atlanta, arrive just before my speech, stay for about an hour, and then catch a train back to Boston.
