38 UP FROM SLAVERY After I had worked in the salt-furnace for some time, work was secured for me in a coal-mine which was operated mainly for the purpose of securing fuel for the salt-furnace. Work in the coal-mine I always dreaded. One reason for thiswas that any onewho workedin acoal-minewas always unclean, at least while atwork, and itwas avery hard job to get one's skin clean after the day's work was over.
 
 Then it was fully a mile from the opening of the coal-mine to the face of the coal,and all, ofcourse, was in the blackestdarkness. I do not believe that one ever experiences anywhere else such darkness as he does in a coal-mine. The mine was divided into a large number of different "rooms" or departments, and, as I never was able to learn the location of all these " rooms," I many times found myselflost in the mine. To add to the horror of being lost, sometimes my light would go out, and then, if I did not happen to have a match, I would wander about in the darkness until by chance I found some one to give me a light. The work was not only hard, but it was dangerous. There was always the danger ofbeingblowntopieces bya prematureexplosion ofpowder, or ofbeing crushed by falling slate. Accidents from one or the other of these causes were frequently occurring, and this kept me in constant fear.
