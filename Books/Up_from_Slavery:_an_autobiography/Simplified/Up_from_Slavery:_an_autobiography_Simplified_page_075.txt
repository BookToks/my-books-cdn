After I had worked in the salt-furnace for some time, I got a job in a coal mine that mainly provided fuel for the salt-furnace. I always hated working in the coal mine. One reason was that anyone who worked there was always dirty, at least while working, and it was really hard to clean your skin after a long day.

The coal face was more than a mile from the mine’s opening, and everything was completely dark. I don’t think you can find darkness like that anywhere else. The mine was split into many different “rooms” or sections, and since I never learned where all of them were, I often got lost. Sometimes my light would go out, and if I didn’t have a match, I would wander around in the dark until I found someone to give me a light.

The work was not only hard but also dangerous. There was always a risk of being blown up by an early explosion or getting crushed by falling rock. These kinds of accidents happened often, so I was always scared. Many young kids back then, and even now in most coal-mining areas, had to spend much of their lives working in these mines with little chance to get an education. What’s worse, I noticed that boys who started working in coal mines early often ended up smaller and weaker both in body and mind.
