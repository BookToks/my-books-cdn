In the early days, very few students knew how to use carpenters' tools, so the beds they made were rough and weak. Often, when I went into the students' rooms in the morning, I would find at least two beds broken and lying on the floor.

It was hard to figure out how to get mattresses. Finally, we solved this by sewing together cheap cloth to make big bags. We filled these bags with pine straw, or pine needles, which we collected from nearby forests.

I'm happy to say that mattress-making has improved a lot since then. Now, it's an important skill taught to many of our girls. The mattresses made at Tuskegee today are about as good as the ones you can buy in regular stores.

For some time after the boarding department opened, we didnâ€™t have chairs in the students' bedrooms or dining rooms. Instead, we used stools that the students made by nailing together three pieces of rough board.
