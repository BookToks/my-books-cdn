No student, no matter how much money they have, is allowed to go through school without doing some kind of manual work. Actually, the hands-on work is now just as popular as the academic subjects. Some of the most successful men and women who graduated from the school started by attending night classes.

While a lot of focus is put on the practical work at Tuskegee, we don’t ignore the religious and spiritual side at all. The school is open to all faiths, but it is very Christian, and the students’ spiritual growth is important. We have preaching services, prayer meetings, Sunday school, Christian groups, and different missionary clubs to show this.

In 1885, Miss Olivia Davidson, who I mentioned before as being very important to the early success of the school, and I got married. During our marriage, she split her time between our home and helping the school. She kept working at Tuskegee and also traveled North to raise money. She died in 1889 after four years of happy marriage and eight years of hard but joyful work for the school.
