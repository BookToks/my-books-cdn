To fix the problem, the General came up with the idea of putting up tents to use as rooms. When it was announced that General Armstrong would be happy if some of the older students stayed in the tents during winter, almost every student in school volunteered to go.

I was one of those volunteers. That winter in the tents was very cold, and we had a hard time—but I’m sure General Armstrong didn’t know how bad it was because we never complained. It was enough for us to know we were making him happy and helping more students get an education. More than once, on cold nights when the wind was strong, our tent would lift up and we’d end up outside. The General usually came to visit the tents early in the morning, and his kind, happy, and encouraging voice would make us feel better.

I’ve said how much I admired General Armstrong, but he was just one example of the many kind men and women who came to help Black schools after the war. Hundreds of them worked hard to help lift up my people.
