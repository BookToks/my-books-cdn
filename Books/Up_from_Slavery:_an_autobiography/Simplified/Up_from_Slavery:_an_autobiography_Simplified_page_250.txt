I explained that my idea of education for Black people was not just to keep them working on farms forever, growing the best and sweetest potatoes. If they did well in farming, they could build a strong base for their kids and grandkids to reach higher and more important goals in life.

These were some of the main ideas I shared in my first speech about the relationship between Black and white people. Since then, I haven’t found any reason to change my thoughts on the big points.

When I was younger, I used to feel angry at anyone who spoke badly about Black people or wanted to take away their chances to grow and succeed. Now, when I hear someone trying to stop others from growing or improving, I feel sorry for that person.

I know that people who do this are usually hurting themselves because they don’t have the chance to grow in the best way. I feel sorry for them because they are trying to hold back the world’s progress, and I believe that one day, as people keep moving forward, they will feel ashamed of their narrow and weak views.
