I found out that this man had made a deal with his master two or three years before the Emancipation Proclamation. The deal was that he could buy his freedom by paying a certain amount each year. While he was paying, he was allowed to work wherever and for whoever he wanted. He went to Ohio because he could earn more money there.

When freedom came, he still owed his master about three hundred dollars. Even though the Emancipation Proclamation said he didn’t have to pay anymore, this man walked most of the way back to Virginia, where his old master lived. He gave his master the last dollar plus interest.

He told me that he knew he didn’t have to pay the debt, but he had promised his master, and he never broke his word. He felt he couldn’t enjoy his freedom until he kept his promise.

Some people might think that some slaves didn’t want freedom because of what I said. But that’s not true. I never saw a slave who didn’t want to be free or who wanted to go back to slavery.
