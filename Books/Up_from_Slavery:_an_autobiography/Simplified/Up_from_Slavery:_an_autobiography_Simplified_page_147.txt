CHAPTER VII EARLY DAYS AT TUSKEGEE

While I was in charge of the Indians and the night school at Hampton, I also studied some things myself with the help of the teachers there. One of these teachers was Rev. Dr. H. B. Frissell, who is now the Principal of the Hampton Institute, after General Armstrong.

In May 1881, near the end of my first year teaching the night school, something I didnâ€™t expect happened. One night, after the usual chapel activities, General Armstrong talked about a letter he had gotten from some men in Alabama. They asked him to suggest someone to run a new school for Black people in the small town of Tuskegee, Alabama.

These men seemed to assume that no qualified Black man could do the job, and they expected General Armstrong to recommend a white man for the position.
