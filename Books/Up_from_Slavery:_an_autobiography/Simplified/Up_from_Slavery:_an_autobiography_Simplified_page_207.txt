Looking back on that part of our struggle, I’m happy we went through it. I’m glad we dealt with all those hard and uncomfortable times.

I’m glad our students had to dig out the space for their kitchen and dining room. I’m glad our first boarding place was in that dark, damp basement. If we had started in a nice, fancy, easy place, I think we might have gotten too proud and full of ourselves. It’s really important, I believe, to start with something you’ve built yourself.

Now, when our old students come back to Tuskegee, they often visit our big, beautiful, well-ventilated, and well-lit dining room. They see delicious food, mostly grown by the students themselves, neat tables with clean cloths and napkins, flowers in vases, and hear birds singing. Every meal is served right on time, with no chaos, and almost no complaints from the hundreds of students who eat there. They often tell me they’re glad we started the way we did and slowly built everything up year by year.
