Mrs. Washington and I visited English people in their country homes. I think that’s where you see English people at their best. I believe the English have figured out how to enjoy life more than Americans.

English home life seems almost perfect to me. Everything runs smoothly, like clockwork. I also noticed how much the servants respect their "masters" and "mistresses." I don’t think Americans would accept those words. English servants usually expect to just be servants, so they get really good at their jobs. In America, servants often want to become "masters" themselves after a few years.

Which system is better? I won’t try to say.

Another thing I noticed in England was how much everyone respects law and order. Things get done easily and well. English people take their time with meals and other things. I’m not sure, but maybe they get as much or more done than busy, nervous Americans.
