In his desire to take guitar lessons he applied to one of his young masters to teach him; but the young man,not having much faith in the ability ofthe slaveto master the guitar at his age, sought to discourage him by telling him: " Uncle Jake, I will give you guitar lessons; but, Jake, I will have to charge you three dollars for the first lesson, two dollars for the second lesson, and one dollar for the third lesson. But Iwill charge you only twenty-five cents for the last lesson." Uncle Jake answered: "All right, boss, I hires you on dem terms. But,boss! Iwants yer to be sure an' give me dat las' lesson first." Soon after my work in connection with the removal of the capital was finished, I received an invitation which gave me great joy and which at the same timewas a very pleasant surprise. This was a letter from General Armstrong, inviting me to return to Hampton at the next Commencement to deliver what was called the "post-graduate address." This was an honour which I had not dreamed of receiving. With muchcare I prepared the best address that I was capable of. I chose for my subject " The Force That Wins." As I returned to Hampton for the purpose of delivering this address, I went over much of the same ground—now, however, covered entirely by BLACK RACE AND RED RACE 95 railroad—that Ihad traversed nearly six years before, when I first sought entrance into Hampton Institute as a student.
