He wanted to take guitar lessons, so he asked one of his young teachers to teach him. But the young man didn’t believe the slave could learn guitar at his age, so he tried to discourage him by saying, "Uncle Jake, I will give you guitar lessons; but I will charge you three dollars for the first lesson, two dollars for the second lesson, and one dollar for the third lesson. But I will charge you only twenty-five cents for the last lesson."

After I finished my work helping move the capital, I got a letter that made me very happy and surprised. It was from General Armstrong, inviting me to come back to Hampton at the next graduation to give a speech called the "post-graduate address." This was an honor I never expected.

I worked carefully to prepare the best speech I could. I chose the topic "The Force That Wins." When I went back to Hampton to give my speech, I saw many of the same places I had seen almost six years before when I first tried to get into Hampton Institute as a student. Now, there was a railroad all along the way.
