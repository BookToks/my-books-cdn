I knew this was the first time ever that a Black person had been asked to speak on the same stage with white Southern men and women at a big national event. I was asked to talk to a group made up of the rich and cultured white South, who were once my masters. I also knew that most of the people there would be from the South, but there would be many white people from the North and lots of Black men and women too.

I was determined to only say what I truly believed was right. When they invited me, they didn’t tell me what to say or what to leave out. I felt that the Board of Directors respected me. They knew that if I said one wrong thing, it could hurt the success of the event a lot. I also knew I had to be honest with my own people, but I couldn’t make a speech that would stop any Black person from ever getting invited again for a long time.
