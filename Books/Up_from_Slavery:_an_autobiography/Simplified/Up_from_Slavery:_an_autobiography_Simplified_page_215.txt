Often, I saw some of them sitting close together around a fire, wrapped in the one blanket we had, trying to stay warm. During the whole night, some of them didn’t even try to lie down. One morning, after a very cold night, I asked the students in the chapel if anyone thought they had frostbite. Three hands went up.

Even with these problems, the students hardly ever complained. They knew we were doing our best for them. They were happy just to have any chance to improve their lives. They kept asking how they could help make things easier for the teachers.

I have heard people say, both in the North and the South, that Black people wouldn’t listen to or respect each other if one of them was in charge. But from my nineteen years at Tuskegee, I can say that I have never been treated with disrespect by any student or staff member, either by words or actions.
