Often I found some of them sitting huddled around a fire,with the one blanket which we had been ableto providewrapped around them, trying in this way to keep warm. During thewhole night some ofthem didnot attempt to lie down. One morning,whenthe night previous had beenunusually cold, I asked those ofthe students in the chapel who thought that they had been frostbitten during the night to raise their hands.
 
 Three hands went up. Notwithstanding these experiences, there was almost no complaining on thepart ofthe students. They knewthat we were doing the best that we could for them. They were happy in the privilege of being permitted to enjoy any kind of opportunity that would enable them to improve their condition. Theywere constantly asking what they might do to lighten the burdens of the teachers.
 
 Ihave heard it stated more than once, both in the North and in the South, that coloured people would not obey and respect each other when one member of the race is placed in a position of authority over others. In regard to this general beliefand these statements, I can say that during the nineteenyears of my experience at Tuskegee I never, either by word or act, have been treated MAKING THEIR BEDS 169 with disrespect by any student or officer connected with the institution.
