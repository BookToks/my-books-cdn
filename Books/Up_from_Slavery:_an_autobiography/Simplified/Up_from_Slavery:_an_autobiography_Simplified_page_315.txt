I don’t really care about games. I have never watched a football game. When it comes to cards, I can’t even tell one card from another.  

The only game I enjoy sometimes is playing old-fashioned marbles with my two boys.  

I guess I might like games more if I had time for them when I was younger, but that wasn’t possible.
