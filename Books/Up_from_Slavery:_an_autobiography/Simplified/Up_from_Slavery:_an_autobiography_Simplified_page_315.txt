266 UP FROM SLAVERY Games I care little for. I have never seen a game of football. In cards I do not know one card from another. Agame of old-fashioned marbleswith my two boys, once in a while, is all I care for in this direction. I suppose Iwould care for games now if I had had anytime inmyyouth to give to them, butthatwas not possible.
