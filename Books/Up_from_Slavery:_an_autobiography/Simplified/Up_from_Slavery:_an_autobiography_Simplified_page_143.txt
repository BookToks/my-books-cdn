" While I was in charge of the Indian boys at Hampton, I had one or two experiences which illustrate the curiousworkings ofcaste in America.
 
 One ofthe Indianboys wastaken ill,anditbecame my duty to take him to Washington, deliver him over to the Secretary of the Interior, and get a receipt for him, in order that he mightbereturned to his Western reservation. At that time I was rather ignorant oftheways oftheworld. During myjourney to Washington, on a steamboat,when the bell rang for dinner, Iwas careful towait and not enter the dining room until after the greater part of the passengers had finished their meal.
 
 Then,with my charge, Iwentto thediningsaloon.
 
 Theman in charge politelyinformed me that the Indian could be served, but that I could not. I never could understand howhe knewjustwhere to draw the colour line, since the Indian and I were ofabout the same complexion. The steward, however, seemed to beanexpertin this matter. Ihad beendirectedbythe authorities atHamptontostop at a certain hotel in Washingtonwith my charge, but when I went to this hotel the clerk stated that hewouldbegladto receivethe Indianinto the house,butsaidthathecould not accommodateme.
