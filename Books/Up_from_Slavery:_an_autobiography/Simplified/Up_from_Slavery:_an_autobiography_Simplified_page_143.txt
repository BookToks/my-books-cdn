When I was in charge of the Indian boys at Hampton, I had a couple of experiences that show how strange the idea of caste was in America.

One of the Indian boys got sick, and I had to take him to Washington. I had to give him to the Secretary of the Interior and get a receipt so he could be sent back to his reservation in the West. At that time, I didn’t know much about how the world worked.

On the trip to Washington, we were on a steamboat. When the bell rang for dinner, I waited until most of the passengers finished eating before going into the dining room with the boy.

The man in charge told me politely that the Indian boy could eat there, but I could not. I never understood how he knew exactly where to draw the color line because the Indian boy and I had about the same skin color. The steward seemed to be an expert at this.

The authorities at Hampton told me to stop at a certain hotel in Washington with the boy, but when I got there, the clerk said he would be happy to take the Indian boy, but he couldn’t let me stay there.
