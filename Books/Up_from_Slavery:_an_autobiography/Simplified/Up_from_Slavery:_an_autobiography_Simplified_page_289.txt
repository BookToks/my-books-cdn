Some years ago I was to deliver an address before a literary society in Madison, Wis. An hour before the time set for me to speak, a fierce snow-storm began,andcontinued for several hours. I made up my mind thatthere would be no audience, and that Ishould nothave to speak,but,as a matter ofduty, I went to the church,andfound itpackedwith people. The surprisegave me a shock that I did not recover from duringthe whole evening.
 
 People often ask me if I feel nervous before speaking, or else they suggest that, since I speak so often, theysuppose that I get usedto it. In answer to this question I have tosaythat I always suffer intensely from nervousness beforespeaking. More than once,just before I was to make an important address, this nervous strain has been so great that I have resolved never again to speak in public. I not only feel nervous before speaking, but after I have finished I usuallyfeel a senseofregret,because it seems to me as if I had left out ofmyaddress the mainthingand thebestthingthat Ihadmeanttosay.
 
 There is a great compensation,though,for this THE SUCCESS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING 243 preliminary nervous suffering, that comes to me after I have been speaking for about ten minutes, andhave come to feel that I have reallymastered my audience, and thatwe have gotten into full and complete sympathywitheachother.
