A few years ago, I was supposed to give a speech to a book club in Madison, Wisconsin. About an hour before I was to start, a big snowstorm began and lasted for several hours. I thought no one would come, so I wouldn’t have to speak. But because I felt it was my responsibility, I went to the church and saw it was full of people. This surprised me so much that I couldn’t stop feeling shocked all night.

People often ask me if I get nervous before speaking or say that since I do it a lot, I must be used to it. I have to say that I always get very nervous before talking in front of others. Sometimes, right before an important speech, I feel so nervous that I decide I will never speak in public again. Not only do I feel nervous before, but after I finish, I usually feel like I forgot to say the most important and best parts of my speech.

But there is something good about feeling nervous at first. After about ten minutes of speaking, I start to feel like I have control of the audience. We begin to connect and understand each other fully, and that makes it all worth it.
