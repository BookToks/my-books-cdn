Even back then, I really believed that what our people needed most was a strong base in education, work, and owning things. I thought it was more important to focus on these than to try to get political favors. For myself, I felt pretty sure I could do well in politics, but I also felt that would be kind of selfishâ€”doing well for myself but not helping to build a strong foundation for everyone else.

At that time, many young men who went to school or college planned to become great lawyers or members of Congress. Many young women wanted to be music teachers. But even then, I had a clear idea that something had to be done first to make it easier for those lawyers, politicians, and teachers to succeed.

I thought the situation was a lot like an old Black man during slavery days who wanted to learn how to play the guitar.
