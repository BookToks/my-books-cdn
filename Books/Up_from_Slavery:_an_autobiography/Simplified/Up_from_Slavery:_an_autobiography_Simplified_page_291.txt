When someone feels deep down, from head to toe, that they have something important to say that can help a person or a cause, they should go ahead and say it. When sharing this message, I don’t think following strict speaking rules helps much.

Some things, like pausing, breathing, and changing your voice tone, are important. But none of these can replace speaking with real feeling. When I have to give a speech, I try to forget all the rules about using perfect English and fancy speaking techniques. I want my audience to forget about those things too.

One thing that really throws me off when I’m speaking is if someone leaves the room. To stop this from happening, I decide to make my speech so interesting and full of cool facts that no one wants to leave. I believe most people want facts, not just general ideas or long lectures. If you give people interesting facts, they can usually figure things out on their own.

The kind of audience I like best is a group of smart, awake, and hardworking business people, like those you find in big cities such as Boston, New York, Chicago, and Buffalo.
