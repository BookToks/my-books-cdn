When one feels, from thebottom of his feet to the top of his head, that he has something tosay thatisgoing tohelp some individual or some cause,then let him say it; and in delivering his message I do not believe that many ofthe artificial rules of elocution can,undersuch circumstances,help him very much.
 
 Although there are certain things, such as pauses, breathing, andpitch of voice,that are very important, none of thesecan take the place of soul in an address. When I have an address to deliver, I like to forget all about the rules for the properuse of the English language, and all about rhetoric and that sort ofthing,and I liketo make the audience forget all about these things, too.
 
 Nothing tends to throw me off my balance so quickly, when I am speaking, as tohave some one leave the room. To prevent this, I make up my mind, as a rule, that Iwill tryto make myaddress so interesting, will try to state so manyinteresting facts one after another, that no one can leave. The average audience, I have come to believe, wants facts rather thangeneralities or sermonizing. Most people, I think, are able to draw proper conclusions ifthey aregiventhe facts in aninteresting form on which tobase them.
 
 As to the kind of audience that I like best to THE SUCCESS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING 245 talk to, I would putat the top ofthe list an organization of strong, wide-awake, business men, such, for example, as is foundin Boston, New York, Chicago, and Buffalo.
