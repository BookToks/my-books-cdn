I never saw a man who was so completely focused on helping others. I don’t think he ever had a selfish thought. He was just as happy helping other schools in the South as he was working for Hampton.

Although he fought against Southern white people in the Civil War, I never heard him say anything mean about them afterward. Instead, he always looked for ways to help Southern white people.

It’s hard to explain how much the students at Hampton looked up to him and trusted him. Actually, they admired him a lot. I never thought General Armstrong could fail at anything he tried to do.

Almost no request he made would be refused. When he stayed at my home in Alabama, he was so paralyzed that he had to be pushed around in a wheelchair. I remember one of his former students had to push his chair up a long, steep hill, which was really hard. When they reached the top, the student smiled and said, “I’m so glad I could do something really hard for the General before he dies!” When I was a student at Hampton, the dorms were so full that there wasn’t enough space for everyone who wanted to live there.
