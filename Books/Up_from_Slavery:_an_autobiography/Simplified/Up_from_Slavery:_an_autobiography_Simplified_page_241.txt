M. F. Foster, a member of the Legislature from Tuskegee, helped us a lot. We first got one thousand dollars from the John F. Slater Fund. The people in charge liked our work, so they started giving us more money every year. Over time, this amount grew, and now we get eleven thousand dollars each year from this fund.

We also got support from the Peabody Fund. At first, they gave us five hundred dollars, but later they increased it to fifteen hundred dollars.

Trying to get help from the Slater and Peabody Funds introduced me to two amazing men who played big roles in deciding how Black people’s education should be. One is the Hon. J. L. M. Curry from Washington, who works as the main agent for both funds, and the other is Mr. Morris K. Jesup from New York.

Dr. Curry is from the South and was a soldier for the Confederacy during the Civil War. But even so, I don’t think anyone cares more about the well-being of Black people than he does. He also doesn’t have any racial bias. He is trusted equally by Black people and Southern white people. I will always remember the first time I met him in Richmond, Virginia, where he lived then.
