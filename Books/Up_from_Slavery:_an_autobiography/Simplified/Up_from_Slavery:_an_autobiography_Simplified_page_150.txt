During the days of slavery, and even after, the town was a place where white people got their education. This was a good thing because I noticed that white people there were pretty cultured and educated, more than in many other places. The colored people were mostly not educated, but they generally didn’t harm their bodies with bad habits like some poor people in big cities did. Overall, the relationship between the two races was friendly. For example, the biggest hardware store in town was owned by a colored man and a white man working together. This partnership lasted until the white man died.

About a year before I came to Tuskegee, some colored people who had heard about the schooling work at Hampton asked the state government for some money to start a teacher training school in Tuskegee. The government agreed and gave two thousand dollars a year. But I found out that this money could only pay the teachers’ salaries. There was no money to buy land, buildings, or equipment.
