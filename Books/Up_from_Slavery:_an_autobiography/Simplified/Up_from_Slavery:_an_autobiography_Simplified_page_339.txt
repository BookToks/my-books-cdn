The City Council of Charleston sent this invitation along with the following message:

Dear Professor Booker T. Washington, Paris, France:

We, the people of Charleston and West Virginia, want to say how proud we are of you and your amazing achievements so far. We would like to show our support for your work in a meaningful way.

Your recent visit to your old home made us feel sad that we didnâ€™t get a chance to hear you speak or help your work before you left for Europe.

Because of this, we warmly invite you to visit our city when you return from Europe. We want to hear you speak and connect with your work in a way that will please you and inspire us.

Please reply soon with the time you expect to arrive. It would mean a lot to us.

Sincerely,  
The Charleston Daily Gazette, The Daily Mail Tribune;  
G. W. Atkinson, Governor;  
E. L. Boggs, Secretary to Governor;  
Wm. M. O. Dawson, Secretary of State;  
L. M. La Follette, Auditor;  
J. R. Trotter, Superintendent of Schools;  
E. W. Wilson, ex-Governor;  
W. A. MacCorkle, ex-Governor;  
John Q. Dickinson, President Kanawha Valley Bank;  
L. Prichard, President Charleston National Bank;  
Geo. S. Couch, President Kanawha National Bank
