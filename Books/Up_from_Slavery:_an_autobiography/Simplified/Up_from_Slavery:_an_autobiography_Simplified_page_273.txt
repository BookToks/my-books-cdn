Washington's address yesterday was one of the most notable speeches, both as to character and as to the warmth ofits reception,ever delivered to a Southern audience. The address was a revelation. The whole speech is a platform upon which blacks and whites can stand with full justice to each other." / The Boston Transcript said editorially: " The speech of Booker T. Washington at the Atlanta Exposition, this week, seems to have dwarfed all the other proceedings and the Exposition itself.
 
 The sensation that it has caused in the press has never been equalled." I very soon began receiving allkinds ofpropositions from lecturebureaus,and editors ofmagazines and papers, to take the lecture platform, and to write articles. One lecture bureau offered me fifty thousand dollars, or two hundred dollars a night and expenses, if I would place my services at its disposal for a given period. To all these communications I repliedthat my life-work was at Tuskegee; andthatwhenever I spoke it must be in the interests of the Tuskegee school and my race, and that I would enter into no arrangements that THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS 227 seemed to place amere commercial value upon my services.
