Washington’s speech yesterday was one of the most important talks ever given to a Southern audience. It was very powerful and everyone loved it. The speech showed a way for both black and white people to be treated fairly.

The Boston Transcript wrote that Booker T. Washington’s speech at the Atlanta Exposition was the most impressive part of the whole event. It caused a huge reaction in the newspapers like nothing else before.

After the speech, I started getting many offers from people who wanted me to give talks or write articles. One group even offered me fifty thousand dollars or two hundred dollars a night plus expenses if I would work with them for a time. But I said no to all of these offers. I told them my main work was at Tuskegee, and whenever I spoke, it had to help the Tuskegee school and my people. I wouldn’t take any deal that made it seem like I was just doing it for money.
