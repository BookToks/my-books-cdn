Looking back now at the whole time after we gained freedom, I think it would have been smarter if there had been a plan. This plan could have made having some education or property, or both, a requirement for voting. And this rule should have been applied fairly to both white and black people.

Even though I was just a young person during Reconstruction, I felt that mistakes were being made. I believed things couldnâ€™t stay the way they were for very long. The Reconstruction policies about my race seemed mostly wrong to me. They felt fake and forced. 

It seemed like the ignorance of black people was being used to help white men get into office. Some people in the North wanted to punish white men in the South by making black people take power over them. I thought that in the end, black people would be the ones who suffered the most. Also, all the political fighting distracted our people from focusing on important things like learning trades and owning property.
