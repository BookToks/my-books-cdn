CHAPTER IX ANXIOUS DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS THE coming of Christmas, that first year of our residence in Alabama, gave us an opportunity to get a farther insight into the real life of the people. The first thing that reminded us that Christmas had arrived was the " foreday" visits of scores of children rapping at our doors, asking for" Chris'mus gifts ! Chris'mus gifts !" Betweenthe hours of two o'clock and five o'clock in the morning I presume that we must have had a half-hundred such calls. This custom prevails throughout this portion of the South to-day.
 
 During the days of slavery itwas acustom quite generally observed throughout all the Southern states togivethecoloured people aweek of holiday at Christmas, or to allow the holiday tocontinue as long as the " yule log" lasted. The male members of the race, and often the female members, were expected to getdrunk. Wefound thatfor awhole week the coloured people in and aroundTuskegee 133 134 UP FROM SLAVERY dropped work the day before Christmas, and that itwas difficult to get any one toperform anyservice from the time they stopped work until after the New Year.
