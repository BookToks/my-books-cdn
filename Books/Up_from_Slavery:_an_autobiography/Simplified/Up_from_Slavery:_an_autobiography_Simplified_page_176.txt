CHAPTER IX ANXIOUS DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS

When Christmas came during our first year living in Alabama, it gave us a chance to learn more about how people really live there. 

The first sign that Christmas was here was when lots of kids came knocking on our doors very early in the morning. They were asking for "Christmas gifts! Christmas gifts!" Between two o'clock and five o'clock in the morning, we probably had about fifty of these visits. This tradition still happens in this part of the South today.

Back when slavery was still around, it was common in all the Southern states to give Black people a week off at Christmas. Sometimes, the holiday lasted as long as the "yule log" kept burning. The men, and often the women too, were expected to get drunk during this time. 

We noticed that for a whole week, the Black people in and around Tuskegee stopped working the day before Christmas. It was hard to find anyone willing to work from then until after the New Year.
