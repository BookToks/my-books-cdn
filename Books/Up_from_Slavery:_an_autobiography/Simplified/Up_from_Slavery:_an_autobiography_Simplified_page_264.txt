CHAPTER XIV THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS

The Atlanta Exposition was a big event where I was asked to speak as a representative of Black people. The event started with a short speech from Governor Bullock. There were other interesting parts too, like a prayer from Bishop Nelson of Georgia, a special poem by Albert Howell, Jr., and speeches from the President of the Exposition and Mrs. Joseph Thompson, who led the Womanâ€™s Board.

Then, Governor Bullock introduced me by saying, "We have with us today a representative of Black business and Black culture." When I stood up to speak, many people cheered, especially Black people. 

What I remember most was wanting to say something that would help bring the races together and encourage them to work well with each other. The only clear thing I remember about my surroundings is seeing thousands of eyes looking right at me when I began speaking.
