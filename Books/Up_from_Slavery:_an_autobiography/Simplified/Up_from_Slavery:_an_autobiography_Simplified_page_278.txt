After I wrote that article, for a whole year, every group or church meeting of my race ended by condemning me or asking me to take back what I said. Many of these groups even told parents not to send their kids to Tuskegee.

One group even chose a "missionary" whose job was to warn people against sending their children to Tuskegee. But this missionary had a son at the school, and I noticed that no matter what he said about others, he didn’t take his own son away from the school. Many Black newspapers, especially those connected to churches, joined in criticizing me or asking me to change my words.

During all this trouble and criticism, I didn’t say a word to explain or take back what I said. I knew I was right and believed that over time, people would see that too. Soon, church leaders started looking carefully into the situation of their ministers, and they found out I was right. In fact, the oldest and most important bishop in one part of the Methodist Church said my words were actually too gentle.
