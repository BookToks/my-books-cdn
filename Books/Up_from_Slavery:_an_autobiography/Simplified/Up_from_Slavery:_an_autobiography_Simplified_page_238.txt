Carnegie’s interest and help. The first time I saw him, ten years ago, he didn’t seem very interested in our school. But I was determined to prove that we deserved his help. After working hard for ten years, I wrote him a letter like this on December 15, 1900.

Mr. Andrew Carnegie, 5 W. Fifty-first St., New York.

Dear Sir: As you asked me when I saw you at your home a few days ago, I am now writing to ask for a library building for our school.

We have 1,100 students, 86 teachers and staff, their families, and about 200 Black people living near the school. All of them would use the library.

We have over 12,000 books and magazines given to us by friends, but we don’t have a good place to keep them or a nice room to read in.

Our graduates work all over the South, and the knowledge from the library would help improve the whole Black community.

We think the building we need would cost about $20,000. The students would do all the work like making bricks, building, carpentry, and blacksmithing. The money you give would not only pay for the building but also give many students a chance to learn building skills. They would use the money they earn to pay for their schooling.
