My trip to England made me respect the nobility more than I ever did before. I didn’t know that regular people really liked and respected them so much. I also didn’t realize how much time and money they spent helping others, and how much they truly cared about it. I used to think they just spent money on having fun.

It was hard for me to get used to talking to English crowds. English people are very serious and always very focused. When I told a funny story that would make Americans laugh out loud, the English just looked at me without smiling.

When an English person becomes your friend, they stick with you like you’re tied together with strong steel ropes. I don’t think there are many friendships that last or feel as good as that.

Maybe the best way to explain this is by sharing what happened once. Mrs. Washington and I were invited to a party by the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland at Stafford House, which is said to be the nicest house in London. I should also say that many people think the Duchess of Sutherland is the most beautiful woman in England.
