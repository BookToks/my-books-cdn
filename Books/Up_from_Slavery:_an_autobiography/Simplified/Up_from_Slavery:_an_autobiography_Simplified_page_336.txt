EUROPE 287 My visit to Englandgavemeahigher regard for the nobility than I had had. I had no idea that theywere so generally loved and respected by the masses, nor had I any correct conception of how much time and money they spent in works of philanthropy, and how much real heart they put into this work. My impression had been that they merely spent money freely and had a "good time." Itwas hard for me to get accustomed to speaking to English audiences. The average Englishman is so serious, and is so tremendously in earnest about everything, that when I told a story that wouldhave made anAmerican audience roar with laughter, the Englishmen simply looked me straight in the face without even cracking asmile.

 Perhaps I can illustrate this point in no better way than by relating the following incident. Mrs.
 
 Washington and I were invited to attend a reception given by the Duke and Duchess ofSutherland, at Stafford Houseâ€”said to be the finest house in London; I may add that I believe the Duchess of Sutherland is said tobe the mostbeautiful woman 288 UP FROM SLAVERY in England.
