Besides these two projects, Mrs. Washington also helped start a women's club at the school. This club meets twice a month and brings together women who live on or near the school to talk about important topics. She is also the President of the Federation of Southern Colored Women's Clubs and the Chair of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Colored Women's Clubs.

Portia, the oldest of my three kids, has learned how to make dresses. She is also really good at playing musical instruments. Besides studying at Tuskegee, she has already started teaching there.

Booker Taliaferro is my next oldest child. Even though he is young, he has almost mastered bricklaying. He started working at this trade when he was quite small, splitting his time between work and school. He has become very skilled and enjoys it. He says he wants to be an architect and bricklayer.

One of the best letters I ever got was from Booker last summer. When I left home for the summer, I told him he had to work at his trade for half the day and could spend the other half however he wanted.
