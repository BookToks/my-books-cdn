A Black boy faces problems, discouragement, and temptations that many people don’t understand because they haven’t experienced them.

When a white boy tries something, people usually expect him to do well. But if a Black boy tries, people are often surprised if he doesn’t fail. In short, Black kids start with people expecting them to fail.

Where you come from, or your family background, can help anyone move forward, but you shouldn’t rely on it too much. People who always point out the Black youth’s mistakes and compare them to white kids don’t think about how important family memories are. For example, I don’t know who my grandmother was. I have had uncles, aunts, and cousins, but I don’t know where most of them are. My story is like the story of many Black people all over the country.

A white boy knows that if he fails, he might let down his whole family history, which goes back many generations. This idea helps him avoid bad choices. Having a proud family background and history can inspire someone to work hard and overcome problems to succeed.
