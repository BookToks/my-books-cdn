Work with these people who, without fighting or trouble, have farmed your land, cleared your forests, built your railroads and cities, dug up valuable resources, and helped make the South grow and improve.

By working with my people, supporting and encouraging them like you are doing here, and helping with education for the mind, hands, and heart, you will see that they will buy your extra land, make your empty fields productive, and run your factories. 

While doing this, you can be sure that in the future, just like in the past, you and your families will be surrounded by the most patient, loyal, law-abiding, and forgiving people the world has ever seen.

We have shown our loyalty before by taking care of your children, watching over your sick parents, and often following them with tears to their graves. In the future, we will stand by you with a dedication that no outsider can match, ready to protect you if necessary.

Our lives—work, business, government, and religion—will be connected with yours in a way that makes the interests of both races one. In social things, we can stay separate like fingers, but together, like a hand, in everything that matters for our mutual progress.
