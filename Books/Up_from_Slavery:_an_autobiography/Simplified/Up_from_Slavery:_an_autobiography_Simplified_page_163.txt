When I was trying to start the little school and during the next nineteen years, there were two men in Tuskegee I always counted on for advice and help. The school’s success happened mostly because of these two men, and I never asked them for help without getting it.

I’ll just describe them simply. One was a white man and used to own slaves, Mr. George W. Campbell. The other was a black man who used to be a slave, Mr. Lewis Adams. These two men were the ones who wrote to General Armstrong asking for a teacher.

Mr. Campbell was a merchant and banker and didn’t know much about education. Mr. Adams was a mechanic and had learned how to make shoes, harnesses, and work with tin during slavery.

He never went to school at all, but somehow he learned to read and write while he was a slave. From the start, these two men understood my plan for education, cared about it, and helped me in every way. When the school was having money problems, Mr. Campbell always helped whenever he could.
