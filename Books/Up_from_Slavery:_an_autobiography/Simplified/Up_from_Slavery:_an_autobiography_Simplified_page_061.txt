Some people had names like "Lincoln" or "John S. Sherman," but the "S" didn’t stand for any name. It was just part of what a Black man proudly called his "entitles." Like I said before, most of the Black people left the old plantation for a little while to try out their freedom and see what it was like. After being away for some time, many of the older slaves went back to their old homes and made some kind of deal with their old owners to stay on the land.

My mom’s husband, who was the stepdad to my brother John and me, didn’t belong to the same owners as my mom. He hardly ever came to our plantation. I remember seeing him maybe once a year, usually around Christmas. Somehow, during the war, he ran away and followed the Union soldiers, and it seems he ended up in the new state of West Virginia. When freedom was announced, he sent for my mom to come to the Kanawha Valley in West Virginia. Back then, traveling from Virginia over the mountains to West Virginia was a hard and sometimes painful journey.
