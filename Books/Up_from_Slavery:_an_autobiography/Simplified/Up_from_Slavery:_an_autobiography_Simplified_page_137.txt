This was not the case at Hampton Institute.

The speech I gave on Commencement Day seemed to make everyone happy, and many people said nice and encouraging things to me about it. Soon after I got back to my home in West Virginia, where I planned to keep teaching, I was surprised again to get a letter from General Armstrong. He asked me to come back to Hampton partly to teach and partly to do some extra studies. This happened in the summer of 1879.

After I started teaching in West Virginia, I picked out four of my smartest and most promising students, along with my two brothers I mentioned before. I gave them special help so they could go to Hampton. They went there, and the teachers found them so well-prepared that they joined advanced classes. This is probably why I was asked to return to Hampton as a teacher. One of the young men I sent to Hampton this way is now Dr. Samuel E. Courtney, a successful doctor in Boston and a member of the city’s School Board.

Around this time, General Armstrong was trying something new—teaching Native American students at Hampton for the first time.
