Thiswas not so at Hampton Institute.
 
 The address which I delivered on Commencement Day seems to have pleased every one, and many kind and encouraging words were spoken to me regarding it. Soon after my return to my home in West Virginia, where I had planned to continue teaching, Iwas again surprised to receive a letter from General Armstrong, asking me to return to Hampton partlyas a teacher and partly to pursue some supplementary studies. This was in the summer of 1879. Soon after I began my first teaching in West Virginia I had picked out four of the brightest and most promising of my pupils, in addition to my two brothers, to whom I have already referred,and hadgiventhem special attention, with the view of having them go to Hampton. They had gone there,and ineach case the teachers had found them sowell prepared that they entered advanced classes. This fact, it seems, led to my being called back to Hampton as a teacher. One of the young men that I sent to Hamptoninthiswayis now Dr. Samuel E. Courtney, a successful physician in Boston, and a member of the School Board ofthat city.
 
 About this time the experimentwas being tried BLACK RACE AND RED RACE 97 for the firsttime, by General Armstrong, ofeducating Indians at Hampton.
