We put the few clothes and household things we had into a cart, but the children walked most of the way, which was hundreds of miles.

I don’t think any of us had ever been far from the plantation before, so traveling to another state was a big deal. Saying goodbye to our old owners and the people from our own race on the plantation was very hard. After we left, we kept writing letters to the older people from our old home, and later on, we stayed in touch with the younger ones too.

The trip took us several weeks. Most nights, we slept outside and cooked our food over a fire. One night, we camped near an empty log cabin. My mom built a fire inside to cook, and then made a bed on the floor to sleep. But just as the fire got going, a big black snake, almost five feet long, dropped down the chimney and ran across the floor. We quickly left that cabin.

Finally, we got to a small town called Malden, which is about five miles from Charleston, the state’s capital. At that time, salt mining was the main business in that part of West Virginia, and Malden was right where the salt furnaces were.
