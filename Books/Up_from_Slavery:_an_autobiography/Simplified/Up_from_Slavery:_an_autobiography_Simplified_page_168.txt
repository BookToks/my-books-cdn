Miss Davidson's experience in the South showed her that the people needed something more than mere book-learning. She heard of the Hampton system ofeducation, and decided thatthis was what shewantedinordertoprepareherselffor better work in the South. The attention of Mrs. Mary Hemenway, ofBoston,was attracted to her rare ability.
 
 Through Mrs. Hemenway'skindnessandgenerosity, Miss Davidson, after graduating at Hampton, received an opportunity to complete a two years' course of training at the Massachusetts State Normal School at Framingham.
 
 Before shewent to Framingham,some one suggested to Miss Davidson that,since shewas so very light in colour, she might find it more comfortable not to be known as a coloured woman inthis school in Massachusetts. She at once replied that under no circumstances and for no considerations would she consent to deceive any one in regard to her racial identity.
 
 Soon after her graduation from the Framingham institution, Miss Davidson cametoTuskegee,bringinginto the school many valuable andfresh ideas as to the best methods of teaching, as well as a rare moral character and a life of unselfishness that I 126 UP FROM SLAVERY think has seldom beenequalled.
