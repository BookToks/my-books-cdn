Miss Davidson’s time in the South showed her that people needed more than just book learning. She heard about the Hampton system of education and decided that this was what she wanted to help her do better work in the South. Mrs. Mary Hemenway from Boston noticed her special talent.

Because Mrs. Hemenway was kind and generous, Miss Davidson got a chance to finish a two-year training course at the Massachusetts State Normal School in Framingham after graduating from Hampton.

Before going to Framingham, someone told Miss Davidson that since she was very light-skinned, it might be easier if she didn’t say she was a colored woman at the school. She quickly said she would never lie about her race no matter what.

Right after graduating from Framingham, Miss Davidson came to Tuskegee. She brought many new and useful ideas about the best ways to teach, along with a strong moral character and a selfless life that I believe is very rare.
