This was not just a simple teaching job.

Anyone can teach boys skills and give them basic schooling. People have been doing that since the very start of civilization. But this job had to be done with the hardest students, inside a society that was controlled by another race. It had to be done without causing fights between races or social groups, which were the biggest problems in the community.

It had to help the whole community. It also had to be done without any local support, even though there was extreme poverty. It had to be done by asking for help, even when one race didnâ€™t understand and the other was full of prejudice.

No one had a tougher job, and it needed a lot of smart thinking to do it right. The real success of Mr. Washington is not just teaching at Tuskegee or getting money from far away. It is that every good Southern white man, even those who thought educating black people was a bad idea, now agrees that the work is important.
