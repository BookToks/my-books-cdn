I told him quickly why I came. I explained that a visit from the Chief Executive of the Nation would not only encourage our students and teachers but also help our whole race. He seemed interested but didn’t promise to come to Tuskegee because his plans to go to Atlanta weren’t set yet. He asked me to remind him about it a few weeks later.

By the middle of the next month, the President had decided to go to the Peace Jubilee in Atlanta. I went to Washington again to ask him to add Tuskegee to his trip. On this second visit, Mr. Charles W. Hare, an important white citizen from Tuskegee, kindly offered to come with me to support the invitation from the white people in Tuskegee and nearby.

Just before I went to Washington the second time, the country was upset, and Black people were very sad because of several violent race riots in the South. When I saw the President, I could tell he was very worried about these fights.

Even though many people were waiting to see him, he stayed with me for a while, talking about the problems and future of our race.
