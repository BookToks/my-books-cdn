I think I never really understood before how much the white people in Tuskegee and nearby areas respected our school.

When we were getting ready for the President’s visit, lots of these people came to me and said they didn’t want to be too forward, but if there was anything they could do to help me or make things easier, all I had to do was ask. It really touched me almost as much as the President’s visit itself to see how proud people of all kinds in Alabama were of our work.

On the morning of December 16th, Tuskegee had a crowd it had never seen before. The President came with Mrs. McKinley and almost all of the Cabinet members, many with their wives or family. Several famous generals came too, like General Shafter and General Joseph Wheeler, who had just come back from the Spanish-American war. There were also many newspaper reporters.

At that time, the Alabama Legislature was meeting in Montgomery. They even passed a resolution to take a break from their work so they could come visit Tuskegee.
