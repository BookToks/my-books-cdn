Both white people and colored people were very interested in the new school starting, and everyone talked a lot about the opening day. However, some white people near Tuskegee didn’t like the idea.

They wondered if the school would really help colored people and worried it might cause problems between races. Some thought that the more education Black people got, the less useful they would be for jobs in the state.

These people were scared that education would make Black people leave farm work and that it would be hard to find them for household jobs.

The white people who didn’t support the school imagined an “educated Negro” as someone trying to act fancy, wearing a tall hat, fake gold glasses, a flashy walking stick, gloves, and fancy boots. To them, education only meant a Black man trying to get by by being clever. They couldn’t see how education could make any other kind of person.
