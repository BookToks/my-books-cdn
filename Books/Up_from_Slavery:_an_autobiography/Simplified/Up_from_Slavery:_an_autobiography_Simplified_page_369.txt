For example, I have taken action against the terrible habit of lynching. When the Louisiana State Constitutional Convention was meeting, I wrote an open letter to them asking for fairness and justice for my race. In all these efforts, I have gotten strong and kind support from newspapers in the South and from other parts of the country too.

Even though there are some signs that might make people think otherwise, I have never felt more hopeful for my race than I do right now. The big rule of life that rewards people for their true worth is always true and everywhere. People outside don’t understand or see the hard fight going on inside the hearts of Southern white people and their former slaves to break free from racial prejudice. While both groups are trying to change, they deserve the sympathy, help, and patience of everyone else.

As I finish writing this autobiography, I find myself—not on purpose—in Richmond, Virginia. This city was the capital of the Southern Confederacy only a few decades ago. About twenty-five years ago, because I was poor, I slept under a sidewalk there many nights.
