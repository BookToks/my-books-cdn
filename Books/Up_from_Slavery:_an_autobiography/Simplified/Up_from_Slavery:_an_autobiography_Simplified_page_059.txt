Was it any wonder that within a few hours the wild rejoicing ceased and a feeling of deep gloom seemed to pervade the slave quarters ? To some it seemed that, nowthatthey were in actual possession of it, freedomwas amore serious thing than they had expected to find it.
 
 Some of the slaves were seventy or eighty years old; their best days were gone. They had no strength with which to earn a living in a strange place and among strange people, even if they had been sure where to find a new place ofabode. To this class the problem seemed especially hard. Besides, deep down intheir hearts therewas astrange and peculiar attachment to "old Marster" and " old Missus," and to their children, which they foundithard to think ofbreaking off. With these they had spent in some cases nearlyahalf-century, and it was no light thing to think of parting.
 
 Gradually, one by one, stealthily at first, the older slaves began towander from the slave quarters back to the "big house" to have awhispered conversation with their former owners as to the future.
