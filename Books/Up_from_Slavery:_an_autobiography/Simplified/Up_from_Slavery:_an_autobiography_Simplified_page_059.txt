Was it any surprise that after a few hours, the wild celebration stopped and a sad feeling spread through the slave quarters? For some, it felt like freedom was a harder and more serious thing than they thought it would be.

Some of the slaves were very old, like seventy or eighty years. Their best days were behind them. They didnâ€™t have the strength to find a new job or live in a new place, even if they knew where to go. For these older people, the problem was especially tough. 

Also, deep down, they still felt a strange kind of loyalty to "old Master" and "old Missus," and to their children. They had spent almost half their lives with them, so it was hard to imagine leaving them.

Slowly, one by one, the older slaves started quietly leaving the slave quarters. They went back to the "big house" to have secret talks with their former owners about what would happen next.
