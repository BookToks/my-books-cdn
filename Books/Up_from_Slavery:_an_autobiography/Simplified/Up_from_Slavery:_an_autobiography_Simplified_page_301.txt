There were said to be sixteen thousand people inside the Auditorium, and it looked like even more were outside trying to get in. No one could get close to the entrance without a policeman’s help. President William McKinley was at the meeting, along with his Cabinet members, many foreign ministers, and a lot of army and navy officers who had done great things in the recent war. The speakers that Sunday evening, besides me, were Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, Father Thomas P. Hodnett, and Dr. John H. Barrows.

The Chicago Times-Herald wrote about my speech and said I talked about how Black people chose slavery over dying out. I reminded everyone about Crispus Attucks, who died at the start of the American Revolution so white Americans could be free, while Black Americans stayed enslaved. I talked about how Black soldiers fought with Andrew Jackson at New Orleans. I also painted a strong and sad picture of Southern slaves who took care of their masters’ families while the masters were fighting to keep slavery going.

I told about the courage of Black troops at battles like Port Hudson and Forts Wagner and Pillow. I praised the brave Black soldiers who fought at El Caney and Santiago to free the people in Cuba, even though they faced unfair treatment in their own country.
