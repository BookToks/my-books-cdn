A few days after I gave my speech, I sent a copy of it to the President of the United States, Grover Cleveland. He wrote back to me with this letter:

GRAY GABLES, BUZZARD'S BAY, Mass., October 6, 1895.

Booker T. Washington, Esq.: My Dear Sir: Thank you for sending me a copy of your speech at the Atlanta Exposition.

I really appreciate your speech. I read it with great interest, and I think the Exposition was important just for giving you a chance to speak. Your words will surely make everyone who cares about your race feel happy and hopeful. If our Black citizens donâ€™t feel encouraged and ready to take full advantage of their rights after hearing you, that would be very surprising.

Yours truly, Grover Cleveland.

Later, I met President Cleveland for the first time when he visited the Atlanta Exposition. At my request and others, he agreed to spend an hour in the Negro Building. He looked at the exhibits and gave the Black people there a chance to shake hands with him.
