MAKING THEIR BEDS 165

From this, I learned that great people choose to love others, while small-minded people hold on to hate. I also learned that helping those who are weak makes you stronger, but treating unlucky people badly makes you weaker.

A long time ago, General Armstrong taught me this lesson, and I decided that no one, no matter their skin color, would make me hate them or make my soul smaller. With God’s help, I believe I have completely let go of any bad feelings toward Southern white men, no matter what wrong they may have done to my people. I feel just as happy helping Southern white men as I do helping people from my own race. I truly feel sorry for anyone who gets stuck in the habit of being racist.

The more I think about it, the more I believe that the worst part of what some people in the South have done to stop Black people from voting isn’t just the harm to Black people. It’s also the lasting damage it does to the character of white people. 166 UP FROM SLAVERY
