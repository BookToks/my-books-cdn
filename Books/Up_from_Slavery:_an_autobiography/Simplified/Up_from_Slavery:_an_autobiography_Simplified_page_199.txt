154 UP FROM SLAVERY Wherever one of our brickmakers has gone in the South, wefind thathe has somethingto contribute to the well-being ofthe community into which he has gone; something that has made the community feel that, in a degree, it isindebted to him, and perhaps, to a certain extent, dependent upon him.

 My experience is that there is something in human nature which always makes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what colour of skin merit is found. I have found, too, thatit is the visible, the tangible, that goes a long ways in softening prejudices.

 The same principle of industrial education has beencarriedout in the building ofour ownwagons, carts, and buggies, from the first. We now own and use on our farm and about the school dozens of these vehicles,and every one ofthem has been built by the hands of the students. Aside from this, we help supply the local market with these vehicles. The supplying of them to the people in the communityhas had the same effect as the supplying ofbricks, and the man who learns at Tuske- MAKING BRICKS WITHOUT STRAW 155 gee tobuild and repairwagons andcarts is regarded as a benefactor by both races in the community where he goes.
