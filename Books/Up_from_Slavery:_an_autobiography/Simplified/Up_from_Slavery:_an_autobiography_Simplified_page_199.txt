Wherever one of our brickmakers goes in the South, we see that he helps the community he joins. He does something valuable that makes people feel thankful and sometimes even a little dependent on him. This has helped create good relationships between different races.

From my experience, people naturally recognize and appreciate talent, no matter what color the person’s skin is. I’ve also learned that seeing something real and useful helps break down prejudices more than just talking about it. For example, actually seeing a great house built by a Black person is much more powerful than reading about a house they might build.

We have used the same idea of learning by doing when making our own wagons, carts, and buggies from the start. We now have dozens of these vehicles on our farm and at the school, and every one was built by the students. We also sell these vehicles to people in the community. Just like with bricks, the people who learn at Tuskegee to build and fix wagons and carts are seen as helpers by both Black and white people in the places they go.
