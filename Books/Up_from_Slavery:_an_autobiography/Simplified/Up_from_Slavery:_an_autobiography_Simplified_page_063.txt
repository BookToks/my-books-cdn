My stepfather had already gotten a job at a salt furnace, and he found a small cabin for us to live in. Our new house was no better than the one we left on the old plantation in Virginia. Actually, in one way it was worse. Even though our old plantation cabin was in bad shape, we always had clean air.  

Our new home was in the middle of a bunch of cabins packed closely together. Since there were no rules about cleanliness, the area around the cabins was often really dirty. Some of our neighbors were Black people, and some were the poorest and least educated white people. It was a mixed group. Drinking, gambling, fights, and bad behavior happened a lot.  

Everyone in the little town was somehow connected to the salt business. Even though I was just a kid, my stepfather made me and my brother work in one of the furnaces. I often started work as early as four o’clock in the morning.  

The first thing I ever learned about books was while working at this salt furnace. Each salt-packer had barrels marked with a certain number. My stepfather’s number was "18." At the end of each day, the boss would put "18" on all of our barrels. I soon learned to recognize that number wherever I saw it. After a while, I could even write that number myself, even though I didn’t know any other numbers or letters.
