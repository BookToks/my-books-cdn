I was always happy to see how much the colored students wanted to help the Indians in every way they could.

A few colored students thought the Indians should not be allowed to come to Hampton, but most did not agree. When asked, the Negro students gladly shared rooms with the Indians to help them learn English and good habits.

I have often wondered if any white school in this country would welcome over a hundred new students from a different race as kindly as these black students at Hampton welcomed the red ones. I have wanted to tell white students that they grow as people when they help others, especially when those others are less lucky or less advanced.

This reminds me of a talk I once had with the Honorable Frederick Douglass. One time, while traveling in Pennsylvania, Mr. Douglass had to ride in the baggage car because of his skin color, even though he paid the same fare as other passengers.
