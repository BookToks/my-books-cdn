Itwas a constant delight to me tonotetheinterestwhichthecolouredstudents took in trying to helpthe Indians in everywaypossible.
 
 There were a few of the coloured students who felt that the Indians ought not to be admitted to Hampton, but thesewerein theminority. Whenever theywereasked to do so, the Negro students gladly took the Indians as room-mates, in order that they might teach them to speak English and to acquire civilized habits.
 
 I have often wondered if there was a white institution in this country whose students would havewelcomedtheincoming of more than a hundredcompanions ofanotherrace in thecordial way that these black students at Hampton welcomed the red ones. How often I havewanted to say to white students thattheylift themselves up in proportion as they help to lift others, and the more unfortunate the race,and the lower in the scale of civilization, the more does one raise one's self by givingthe assistance.
 
 This reminds me of a conversation which I once had with the Hon. Frederick Douglass. At one time Mr. Douglass was travelling in the state of Pennsylvania, and was forced, on account of his UP FROM SLAVERY 100 colour, to ride in the baggage-car, in spite of the fact that he had paidthe same price forhispassage that the other passengers had paid.
