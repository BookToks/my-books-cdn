Some people might say this was stealing. If it happened now, I would say it was stealing too. But back then, and for the reasons it happened, I could never believe my mother was a thief. She was just a victim of slavery.

I don't remember sleeping in a bed until after our family was set free by the Emancipation Proclamation. My older brother John, my sister Amanda, and I slept on a pile of dirty rags on the dirt floor.

Not long ago, someone asked me about the sports and fun things I did when I was young. Before that, I never thought about it, but I realize now I never really had time to play. Almost every day was spent working.

When I was a slave, I wasnâ€™t big enough to do hard work, but I still had jobs like cleaning the yards, carrying water to the men working in the fields, or taking corn to the mill once a week to be ground.
