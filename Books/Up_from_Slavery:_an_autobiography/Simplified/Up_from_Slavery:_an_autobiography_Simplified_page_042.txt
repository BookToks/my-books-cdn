Some people may call this theft. If such a thing were to happen now, I should condemn it as theft myself. But taking place atthe timeit did, and for the reason thatitdid, no one could ever make me believe that my mother was guilty ofthieving. Shewas simply a victim of the system of slavery. I cannot remember having sleptin abed until after our family was declared free by the Emancipation Proclamation. Three childrenâ€”John, my older brother, Amanda, mysister, and myself-had a pallet on the dirt floor, or, to be more correct, we slept in and onabundle of filthy rags laid upon the dirt floor.
 
 Iwas asked not long ago totell something about.
 
 the sports and pastimes that I engaged in during my youth. Until that question was asked it had never occurred to me that there was no period of my life thatwas devoted to play. From the time that I can remember anything, almost every day ofmy life has been occupied in some kind of labour; though I think Iwould nowbe amore useful man ifI had had time for sports. During the period that I spent in slavery I was not large enoughto be of much service,still I was occupied most of the time in cleaning the yards, carrying water tothemen inthe fields, or goingto the mill, 6 UP FROM SLAVERY to which I used to take the corn,once aweek, to be ground.
