CHAPTER X A HARDER TASK THAN MAKING BRICKS WITHOUT STRAW

From the very beginning at Tuskegee, I wanted the students to do more than just farm and housework. I wanted them to build their own buildings too. My idea was that while they worked, they would learn the newest and best ways to do things.

This way, the school would benefit from their work, but the students would also learn to see work as something useful, beautiful, and important. They would learn how to make work more than just hard and boring, and they would start to enjoy working. I didn’t want to teach them the old, slow ways. Instead, I wanted to show them how to use natural forces like air, water, steam, electricity, and horse power to help them work better.

At first, many people said it was a bad idea to have the students build the buildings themselves. But I was determined to try it. I told the doubters that I knew our first buildings wouldn’t be perfect.
