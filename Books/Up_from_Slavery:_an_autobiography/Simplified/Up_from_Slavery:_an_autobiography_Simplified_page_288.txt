The crowd might get really loud, but his serious face never changed.

A big, dark-skinned man was sitting on the floor in one of the aisles, watching the speaker with burning eyes and a shaking face until everyone clapped loudly. Then tears started running down his face. Most of the Black people in the crowd were crying too, maybe without even knowing why.

When the speech ended, Governor Bullock quickly walked across the stage and grabbed the speaker’s hand. The crowd cheered again, and for a few minutes the two men stood looking at each other, holding hands.

After my speech in Atlanta, whenever I had time away from my work at Tuskegee, I accepted some invitations to speak in public. I especially went to places where I thought it would help to support my race. But I always made sure I could talk about my life’s work and what my people needed.

I also made it clear that I wasn’t speaking as a professional lecturer or just to make money.

When I spoke in public, I never understood why people came to hear me. I still can’t figure it out. Many times, I’ve stood outside a building and watched men and women go inside to listen, and I felt bad that I might be making them waste a valuable hour of their time.
