The sadness in the slave quarters was almost as deep as in the "big house." When the two young masters came home hurt, the slaves showed their care in many ways. They wanted to help take care of them just like the family did.

Some slaves even asked to stay up at night to watch over and nurse their injured masters.

This kindness and care from the slaves came from their good and generous hearts. To protect the women and children left on the plantations while the white men went to war, the slaves would have given their lives. The slave chosen to sleep in the "big house" when the men were away was given a special honor. Anyone trying to hurt the "young Mistress" or "old Mistress" at night would have to go through the slave first. 

I don’t know if many people have noticed this, but I think it’s true that very few people from my race have ever betrayed someone who trusted them, whether during slavery or after.

Usually, people from my race didn’t feel hatred toward the white people before and during the war. In fact, many slaves even took good care of their old masters and mistresses who became poor and needed help after the war.
