CHAPTER V THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD

The years from 1867 to 1878 can be called the time of Reconstruction.

This was when I was a student at Hampton and later a teacher in West Virginia. During this time, two main ideas were always on the minds of many Black people. One was a strong interest in learning Greek and Latin, and the other was a wish to get government jobs.

It was hard to expect that people who had been slaves for so long, and before that had no chance to learn, would understand what education really meant at first. Everywhere in the South during Reconstruction, schools were very full with people of all ages. Some students were as old as sixty or seventy years.

It was great and inspiring that so many wanted to learn. But many believed that just a little bit of education would somehow free them from hard life struggles, and that they wouldnâ€™t have to do physical work anymore.
