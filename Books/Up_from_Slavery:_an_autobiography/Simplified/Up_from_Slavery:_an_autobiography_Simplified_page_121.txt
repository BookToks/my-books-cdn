CHAPTER V THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD THE years from 1867 to 1878 I think may be called the period of Reconstruction.
 
 This included the time that I spent as a student at Hampton and as a teacher in West Virginia. During thewhole of the Reconstruction period two ideaswere constantlyagitating theminds ofthe coloured people, or, at least, the minds of a large part ofthe race. One of these was the craze for Greek and Latin learning,and the other was a desire to hold office.
 
 It could not have been expected that a people who had spent generations in slavery, and before thatgenerations inthe darkest heathenism, could at first form any proper conceptionofwhat an educationmeant. In everypart ofthe South,during the Reconstruction period, schools,bothday and night, were filled to overflowingwithpeopleofall ages and conditions, some being as far along in age as sixty and seventy years. The ambitionto secure an educationwasmostpraiseworthyand encouraging. The 80 THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD 81 idea,however,wastooprevalent that,as soon as one secured a littleeducation,insome unexplainableway he wouldbe freefrom most of the hardships ofthe world, and, at any rate, could live without manual labour.
