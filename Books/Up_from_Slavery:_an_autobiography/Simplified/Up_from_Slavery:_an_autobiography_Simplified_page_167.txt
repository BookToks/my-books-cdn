The number of students grew every week. By the end of the first month, there were almost fifty.

Many of them said they could only stay for two or three months. They wanted to join a high-level class and get a diploma in the first year if possible.

After six weeks, a new and unusual teacher came to the school. This was Miss Olivia A. Davidson, who later became my wife. Miss Davidson was born in Ohio and went to public schools there. When she was still a young girl, she heard that the South needed teachers. She moved to Mississippi and started teaching there. Later, she taught in Memphis.

While teaching in Mississippi, one of her students got smallpox. Everyone in the town was scared and no one wanted to take care of the boy. Miss Davidson closed her school and stayed by the boyâ€™s side day and night until he got better. When she was home in Ohio on vacation, a bad yellow fever outbreak happened in Memphis. When she heard about it, she sent a message to the Mayor of Memphis, offering to help as a nurse, even though she had never had yellow fever before.
