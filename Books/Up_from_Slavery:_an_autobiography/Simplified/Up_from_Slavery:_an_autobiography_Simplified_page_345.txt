Could you be in Cambridge on that day?

Believe me, with great respect, Yours truly, Charles W. Eliot.

I never thought about this before, and it was hard to believe I would be honored with a degree from the oldest and most famous university in America. As I sat on my porch holding this letter, tears came to my eyes. My whole past—being a slave on a plantation, working in a coal mine, times when I had no food or clothes, sleeping under a sidewalk, struggling to get an education, the hard days at Tuskegee, not knowing where to find money to continue the work there, and the discrimination and unfair treatment of my race—all of this came back to me and almost overwhelmed me.

I never wanted or cared about what the world calls fame. I have always seen fame as something to use to do good. I often told my friends that if I can use any attention I get to help others, I am happy to have it. I care about it only as a tool for doing good, just like money can be used.
