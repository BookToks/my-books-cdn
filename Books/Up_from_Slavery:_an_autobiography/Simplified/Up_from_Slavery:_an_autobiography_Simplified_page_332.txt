Mr. Garrison and some other friends gave us lots of letters to introduce us to people. They also sent letters to others in different parts of the United Kingdom to let them know we were coming. Soon after we got to London, we started getting many invitations to parties and events. A lot of people also asked me to give public speeches.

I said no to most of these invitations because I wanted to rest. We could only go to a few of the events. The Rev. Dr. Brooke Herford and Mrs. Herford, who I knew from Boston, talked with the American Ambassador, Mr. Joseph Choate. They planned a public meeting for me to speak at Essex Hall. Mr. Choate kindly agreed to lead the meeting.

Many people came to the meeting, including some important people like members of Parliament and Mr. James Bryce, who also spoke. What the American Ambassador said when introducing me, and a summary of my speech, were printed in newspapers in both England and America. Dr. and Mrs. Herford gave a reception for Mrs. Washington and me, where we met some of the best people in England.
