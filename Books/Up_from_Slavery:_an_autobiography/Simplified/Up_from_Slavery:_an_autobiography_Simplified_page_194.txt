The buildings made by the students were not as nice or finished as those built by experienced workers. But by building the buildings themselves, the students learned important skills like self-help and independence, which was even more valuable.

I also told people who didnâ€™t agree with this idea that most of our students came from poor families who worked on cotton, sugar, and rice farms in the South. While it would be nice to give the students beautiful buildings right away, it was better to teach them how to build their own. They would make mistakes, but those mistakes would help us learn and improve in the future.

For the past nineteen years, the Tuskegee school has kept this plan of having students build the buildings. In that time, we have built forty buildings, big and small, and almost all of them were made mostly by the students. Because of this, hundreds of men across the South learned mechanics while helping build these buildings. Skills and knowledge are now passed down from one group of students to the next. Today, our teachers and students can design and build any kind of building, including installing electric fixtures, without needing to hire outside workers.
