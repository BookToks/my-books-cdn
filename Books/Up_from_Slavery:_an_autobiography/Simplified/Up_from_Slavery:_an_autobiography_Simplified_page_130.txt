Some people had small government jobs, and many others were there hoping to get federal jobs.

At that time, a number of Black men—some very smart and strong—were in the House of Representatives, and one, the Honorable B. K. Bruce, was in the Senate. This made Washington a popular place for Black people. They also knew that the law would protect them in the District of Columbia. The public schools for Black kids in Washington were better than in other places.

I was very interested in learning about the lives of our people there. I found that while many were good and respectable citizens, there was a problem with many others. I saw young Black men who made less than four dollars a week spend over two dollars on a buggy ride on Sundays just to look rich. I saw others who earned seventy-five to one hundred dollars a month from the government but still ended up in debt every month. I even saw men who had been members of Congress just a few months before, now jobless and poor.
