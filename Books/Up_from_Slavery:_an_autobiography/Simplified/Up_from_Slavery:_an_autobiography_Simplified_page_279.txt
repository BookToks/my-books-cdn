Very soon, people started to show their feelings by asking for better leaders in the church. Although this change isnâ€™t finished yet, I can say, without bragging, and many important church leaders have told me, that my words helped start the demand for better men to lead in the church.

The way Black ministers have improved their character and lives is one of the best signs that our race is moving forward. My experiences with them, and other things in my life, have taught me that when you believe you are right but people criticize you, the best thing is to stay calm and quiet. If you are right, time will prove it.
