I don’t think the same amount of money could often do so much to help improve a whole race.

If you want more information, I will be happy to provide it.

Sincerely, Booker T. Washington, Principal.

The next letter I got said, “I will be very happy to pay the bills for the library building as they come, up to twenty thousand dollars. I’m glad to have this chance to support your important work.” I have learned that using strict business methods helps a lot in getting rich people interested. At Tuskegee, I always try to manage money and other things in a way that any big New York bank would approve of.

I have talked about some big donations to the school, but most of the money to build the school has come from small donations by people with average incomes.

It’s these small gifts, which show the support of many donors, that most charity work depends on to keep going.
