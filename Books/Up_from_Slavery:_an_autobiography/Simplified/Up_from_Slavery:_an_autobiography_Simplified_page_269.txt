None of us can be truly safe or secure unless everyone is smart and growing. If there are any efforts to stop Black people from reaching their full potential, those efforts should instead help and encourage them to become the most useful and intelligent citizens. Putting energy into this will bring huge benefits. These efforts will be good for both the person giving help and the person receiving it.

No one can avoid the natural law of fairness: oppressors and the oppressed are connected, sharing pain and suffering, and together we move toward our future.

Almost sixteen million people will either help lift the load up or pull it down. We can be one-third of the problem—ignorance and crime—or one-third of the solution—intelligence and progress. We can contribute one-third to the South’s success in business and industry, or we can become a dead weight, holding back every attempt to make things better.
