I lived in this cabin with my mom, my brother, and my sister until after the Civil War, when we were all set free.

I don’t know much about my family history. When I was in the slave quarters, and even later, I heard people quietly talking about the terrible things slaves went through on the slave ships coming from Africa to America. I think some of my mom’s family went through that too. But I haven’t been able to find any real information about my family before my mom.

I remember my mom had a half-brother and a half-sister. Back in slavery times, not many people cared about keeping family records, especially black families. I guess my mom caught the eye of the person who bought her, and that person became our owner. Buying a slave was treated about the same as buying a horse or a cow.

About my dad, I know even less than about my mom. I don’t even know his name. I heard he was a white man who lived on a nearby plantation. But no one ever said he cared about me or helped raise me. Still, I don’t blame him much.
