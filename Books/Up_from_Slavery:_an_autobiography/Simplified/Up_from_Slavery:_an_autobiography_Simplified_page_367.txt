The day after the yearly Negro Conference, there is a "Workers' Conference." This group is made up of officers and teachers who work in big schools in the South. The Negro Conference gives these workers a special chance to learn about the real lives of everyday people.

In the summer of 1900, with help from important Black leaders like Mr. T. Thomas Fortune, who always supported me, I started the National Negro Business League. Its first meeting was in Boston and brought together many Black men who worked in different kinds of business all over the United States. Thirty states sent people to this first meeting. From this national meeting, smaller state and local business groups were created.

Besides handling the main work at Tuskegee and raising most of the money to keep the school running, I also have to answer many requests to speak. These invitations come from white people in the South, from my own race, and often from groups in the North.
