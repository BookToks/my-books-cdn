My experience raising money for Tuskegee has taught me not to get mad at rich people just because they are rich or don’t give a lot to charity. 

First, people who criticize the rich don’t realize how many people would lose their jobs and how much trouble would happen if rich people gave away a big part of their money all at once. This could mess up big businesses.

Also, most people don’t know how many requests for help rich people get every day. I know some rich people who get as many as twenty requests each day. When I have visited rich men’s offices, I have seen half a dozen people waiting to ask for money.

These visits are just the ones that happen in person. There are also many requests sent by mail. 

Very few people understand how much money rich people give away quietly. I have heard people being criticized for not giving money, even though I know they give away thousands of dollars every year without telling anyone.
