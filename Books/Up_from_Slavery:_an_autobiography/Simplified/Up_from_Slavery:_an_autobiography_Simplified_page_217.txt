When I went intothe car, Ifound there two ladies from Bostonwhom I knewwell. These good ladies were perfectly ignorant, itseems, ofthe customs of the South, and in the goodness of their hearts insisted that I take a seatwith them in their section. After some hesitation I consented. I had been there but a fewminutes when one of them, without my knowledge,orderedsupper to be served to the three of us. This embarrassed me still further. The carwas full of Southernwhite men, most ofwhom hadtheir eyes on our party. When Ifound that supper had been ordered, I tried to contrive some excuse thatwould permit meto leave the section,butthe ladies insisted that I must eat with them. I finally settledbackin myseatwith a sigh, and said to myself, "I am in for it now, sure".
 
 To add furtherto theembarrassment of thesituation, soon afterthe supperwas placed onthe table one of theladies remembered that she had in her satchel a special kind of tea which she wished served, and as she said she feltquite sure the porter didnot knowhowto brew it properly,she insisted upongettingup andpreparing and serving it herself. At lastthe mealwas over; and itseemedthe MAKING THEIR BEDS 171 longestonethat Ihad ever eaten.
