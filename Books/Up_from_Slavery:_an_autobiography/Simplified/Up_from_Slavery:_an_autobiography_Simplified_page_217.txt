When I got into the car, I saw two ladies from Boston who I knew well. These nice ladies didn’t know much about Southern customs and kindly told me to sit with them in their section. After thinking about it for a bit, I agreed.

I had only been there a few minutes when one of them, without telling me, ordered supper for the three of us. This made me feel even more awkward. The car was full of Southern white men, and most of them were staring at us. When I found out supper was coming, I tried to find a way to leave the section, but the ladies said I had to eat with them. I finally gave up and sat back, thinking, “I’m stuck now for sure.”

To make things even more awkward, soon after the food arrived, one lady remembered she had a special kind of tea in her bag. She wanted it served and said she was sure the porter didn’t know how to make it right. So, she got up to prepare and serve the tea herself. Finally, the meal ended; it felt like the longest meal I had ever eaten.
