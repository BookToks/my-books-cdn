The mill was about three miles from the plantation. I always hated this job. A heavy bag of corn was thrown across the horse’s back, with half the corn on each side. But almost every time, the corn would shift and fall off, and sometimes I would fall too. 

I wasn’t strong enough to put the corn back on the horse by myself, so I had to wait, sometimes for many hours, until someone passed by and helped me. While waiting, I usually cried. This made me late getting to the mill. By the time I got my corn ground and went home, it was very late at night. 

The road was lonely and often went through thick forests. I was always scared. People said the woods were full of soldiers who had run away from the army. I was told that if a runaway soldier found a Black boy alone, he would cut off his ears. Also, if I got home late, I knew I would get in big trouble or even get whipped. 

I never went to school when I was a slave. But I remember a few times when I went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of my young mistresses to carry her books.
