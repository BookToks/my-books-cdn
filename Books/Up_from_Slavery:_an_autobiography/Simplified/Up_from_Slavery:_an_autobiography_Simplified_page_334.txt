I was the main speaker at the graduation ceremony of the Royal College for the Blind. This event took place in the Crystal Palace, and the person in charge was the late Duke of Westminster, who was said to be the richest man in England, maybe even the world. The Duke, his wife, and their daughter seemed happy with my speech and thanked me warmly.

Thanks to Lady Aberdeen’s kindness, my wife and I got to join a group attending the International Congress of Women in London. We went to see Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, and later, she invited us all to have tea with her. Miss Susan B. Anthony was also in our group. I was really impressed because it’s rare to meet two such amazing women like Susan B. Anthony and Queen Victoria at the same time.

We visited the House of Commons several times, where we met Sir Henry M. Stanley. I talked with him about Africa and how it relates to African Americans. After our talk, I was even more sure that moving to Africa was not the solution for African Americans to improve their lives.
