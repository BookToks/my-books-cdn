The shop owners in town let us get food now and pay later. Actually, back then I felt embarrassed because people trusted me more than I trusted myself. It was pretty hard to cook without stoves, and eating without proper dishes was awkward. At first, we cooked outside the old-fashioned way, using pots and pans over a fire. We used some carpenter benches as tables. There weren’t many dishes, so it wasn’t worth talking about them.

No one in charge of the boarding seemed to know that meals should be served at set times, and this caused a lot of stress. Everything was so messy and inconvenient that I can say something went wrong at every meal during the first two weeks. Sometimes the meat was undercooked or burnt, the bread had no salt, or the tea was forgotten.

One early morning, I was standing near the dining room door listening to the students complain.
