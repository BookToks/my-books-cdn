It was decided that the building would be designed and built completely by Black workers. This plan was followed. In design, beauty, and overall finish, the Negro Building was just as good as the others on the grounds.

After they decided to have a separate Black exhibit, they had to choose who would be in charge. The Exposition officials wanted me to take this job, but I said no because my work at Tuskegee needed all my time and energy. Mostly because of me, Mr. I. Garland Penn from Lynchburg, Virginia, was picked to lead the Negro department. I helped him as much as I could. The Black exhibit was big and impressive. The two parts that got the most attention were from the Hampton Institute and the Tuskegee Institute. The Southern white people were the most surprised and happy about what they saw in the Negro Building.

As the Exposition opening day got closer, the Board of Directors started making plans for the opening events. While talking about the program, they wondered if it was a good idea to have a Black person give one of the opening speeches, since Black people were asked to play an important role in the Exposition.
