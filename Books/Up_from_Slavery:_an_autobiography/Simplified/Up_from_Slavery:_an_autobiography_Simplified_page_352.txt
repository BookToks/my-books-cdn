In the fall of 1898, I heard that President McKinley might visit Atlanta, Georgia, to join the Peace Jubilee events celebrating the end of the Spanish-American War. At that time, I had been working hard with my teachers for eighteen years to build a school that we believed would help the country. I decided to try to get the President and his Cabinet to visit us.

I went to Washington and soon found my way to the White House. When I arrived, the waiting rooms were full of people, and I started to feel nervous because I thought I might not get to see the President that day. But at least I got a chance to talk to Mr. J. Addison Porter, the President’s secretary, and told him why I was there.

Mr. Porter kindly sent my card straight to the President, and after a few minutes, I got a message that President McKinley would see me.

I don’t understand how any man can meet so many people with different requests, work so hard, and still stay calm, patient, and fresh for each visitor like President McKinley does. When I met him, he kindly thanked me for the work we were doing at Tuskegee to help the country.
