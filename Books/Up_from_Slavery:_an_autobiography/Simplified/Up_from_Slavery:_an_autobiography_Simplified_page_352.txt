LAST WORDS 303 In the fall of 1898 I heard that President McKinley was likely to visit Atlanta,Georgia, for the purpose oftaking partinthe PeaceJubileeexercises tobeheldthereto commemorate the successfulclose ofthe Spanish-Americanwar. At this time I had beenhard at work, together with our teachers, for eighteen years, trying to build up a school that we thought would be of service to the Nation, and I determined to make a direct effort to secure a visit from the President and his Cabinet. I went to Washington, and Iwas not long in the city before I found my way to the White House. When I got there I found thewaiting rooms full of people, andmyheartbeganto sink,for I feared therewould not be much chance ofmyseeing the President that day, if at all. But, at any rate, I got an opportunity to see Mr. J. Addison Porter, the secretary to the President, and explained to him my mission.
 
 Mr. Porterkindlysentmy carddirectlyto the President, and in a few minutes word came from Mr.
 
 McKinley that he would see me.
 
 How any man can see so many people of all kinds, with all kinds of errands, and do so much hardwork, and stillkeep himself calm, patient, and fresh for each visitorin theway that President McKinley does, I cannot understand. When I saw the President he kindly thanked me for thework 304 UP FROM SLAVERY which we were doing at Tuskegee for the interests of the country.
