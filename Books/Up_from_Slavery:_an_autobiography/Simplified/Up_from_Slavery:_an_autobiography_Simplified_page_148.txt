The next day, General Armstrong called me to his office and, to my surprise, asked if I thought I could take the job in Alabama. I told him I was willing to try. So, he wrote to the people who had asked him for information, saying he didn’t know any white man to suggest, but if they were okay with a Black man, he could recommend me. He gave them my name in the letter.

A few days went by with no news. Then, one Sunday evening during chapel, a messenger came in and gave the General a telegram.

After the exercises, the General read the telegram to everyone at school. It basically said: "Booker T. Washington will work for us. Send him right away." Everyone—students and teachers—was very happy, and I got lots of congratulations. I started getting ready to go to Tuskegee right away. I traveled through my old home in West Virginia and stayed there for a few days before heading to Tuskegee.

When I arrived, I found Tuskegee was a town of about two thousand people, and nearly half were Black. It was in an area called the Black Belt of the South. In the county where Tuskegee is located, Black people outnumbered white people by about three to one.
