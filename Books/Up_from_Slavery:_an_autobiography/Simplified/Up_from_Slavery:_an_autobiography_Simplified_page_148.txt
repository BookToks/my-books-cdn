The next day General Armstrong sent for me to come to his office, and, much to my surprise, askedmeif I thought I could fill the position in Alabama. I told him that I would be willingto try. Accordingly, he wrote to the people who had applied to him forthe information, that he did not knowofanywhitemanto suggest,but if theywould be willingto takeacoloured man, he had one whom he could recommend. In this letter he gave them my name.
 
 Several days passed before anything more was heard about the matter. Some time afterward, one Sunday evening during the chapel exercises, amessenger came in and handedthe General a telegram.
 
 Atthe end of the exercises he read the telegram to the school. In substance, these were its words : " Booker T. Washington will suit us. Send him at once." There was a great deal ofjoy expressed among the students and teachers,and I receivedvery hearty congratulations. Ibegan toget readyat once to go to Tuskegee. Iwent byway ofmy old home in WestVirginia,where I remainedforseveraldays,after which I proceeded to Tuskegee. I found Tuskegee to be a town ofabout two thousand inhabitants, nearly one-half ofwhom were coloured. Itwas in whatwas known as the Black Beltofthe South. In 108 UP FROM SLAVERY thecountyinwhichTuskegeeissituatedthecoloured people outnumbered the whites by about three to one.
