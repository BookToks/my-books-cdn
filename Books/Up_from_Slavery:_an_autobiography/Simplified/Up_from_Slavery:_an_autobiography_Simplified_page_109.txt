70 UP FROM SLAVERY Toward the end of the first month, Iwent to a placeaconsiderable distance from myhome, to try to find employment. Ididnot succeed,anditwas night before I got started on myreturn. When I hadgotten within a mile or so of myhome I was so completely tired out that I could notwalk any farther, and I went into an old,abandoned house to spendtheremainder ofthe night. About three o'clock inthe morning mybrother John found me asleep in this house,and broke to me,as gently as he could,the sad news that our dear mother had diedduringthe night.
 
 This seemed to me the saddest and blankest moment inmy life. For several years mymother had not been in good health, but I had no idea, when I parted from her the previous day, that I should never see her alive again. Besides that, I had always had an intense desire to be with her when she did pass away. One of the chief ambitions which spurred me on at Hampton was that Imightbe able to get to be inapositioninwhich I could better make my mother comfortable and happy. She had so often expressed the wish that shemightbe permitted to live to seeherchildren educatedandstarted out into the world.
 
 In a very short time after the death of my mother our little home was in confusion. My HELPING OTHERS 71 sister Amanda, although she tried to do the best shecould, was too young to knowanything about keeping house, and my stepfatherwas not able to hireahousekeeper.
