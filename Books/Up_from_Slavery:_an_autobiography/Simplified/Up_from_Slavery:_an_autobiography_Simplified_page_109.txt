Near the end of the first month, I went far from home to try to find a job. I didn’t have any luck, and it was already night when I started going back. When I was about a mile from home, I was so tired I couldn’t walk anymore. I went into an old, empty house to sleep for the night. Around three in the morning, my brother John found me sleeping and gently told me the sad news that our mother had died during the night.

This was the saddest and most empty moment of my life. My mother had been sick for years, but when I left her the day before, I didn’t think I would never see her alive again. I really wanted to be with her when she died. One big reason I worked hard at Hampton was to be able to help make my mother comfortable and happy. She often said she wanted to live long enough to see her children get educated and start their lives.

Soon after my mother died, our small home became very messy. My sister Amanda tried her best, but she was too young to know how to take care of the house. My stepfather couldn’t find someone to help with the housework.
