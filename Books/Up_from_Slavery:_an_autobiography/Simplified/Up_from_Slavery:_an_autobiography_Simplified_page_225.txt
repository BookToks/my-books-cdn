We decided to name the new building Alabama Hall, to honor the state where we were working. Miss Davidson started trying again to get both Black and white people around Tuskegee interested and willing to help. They wanted to help as much as they could.

The students, like they did for the first building Porter Hall, started digging the ground so we could lay the foundation.

When it looked like we had no more money, something happened that showed how great General Armstrong was—how he was different from most people. When we were really worried about where to get money for the new building, I got a message from General Armstrong. He asked if I could spend a month traveling with him in the North and told me to come to Hampton right away. I said yes and went to Hampton.

When I got there, I found out the General had planned to take a group of four singers to the North and hold meetings in big cities for a month. He and I were going to speak at these meetings. I was really surprised when he told me these meetings were not for Hampton’s benefit, but to help Tuskegee, and that Hampton Institute would pay for all the costs.
