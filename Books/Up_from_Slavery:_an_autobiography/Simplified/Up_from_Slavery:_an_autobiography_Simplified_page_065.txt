In just a few weeks, I learned most of the alphabet. My mom was really supportive and helped me as much as she could. Even though she didnâ€™t know much from books, she wanted her kids to do well and had a lot of common sense. I think I got my drive from her.

While I was trying hard to get an education, a young Black boy who had learned to read in Ohio came to Malden. When people found out he could read, they got a newspaper for him. After work each day, a group of men and women would gather around him to hear him read the news. I really wished I could do that. He seemed like the only young man in the world who was happy with what he had learned.

Around this time, people in the Black community started talking about opening a school for Black children in the village.
