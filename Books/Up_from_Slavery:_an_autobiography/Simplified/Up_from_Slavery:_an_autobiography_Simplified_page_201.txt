Most of the new students came with a note or a message from their parents saying they only wanted their kids to learn from books. The more books, the bigger they were, and the longer the titles on them, the happier the students and their parents seemed to be.

I didn’t pay much attention to these complaints, but I took every chance I could to travel around the state. I talked to parents to explain why learning practical skills was important. I also talked a lot with the students about this. Even though learning industrial skills wasn’t popular, the school kept growing. By the middle of the second year, about one hundred and fifty students were attending, from almost all over Alabama and even a few from other states.

In the summer of 1882, Miss Davidson and I went North to raise money to finish building our new school.

On my way North, I stopped in New York to ask a leader of a missionary group, who knew me a little from before, for a letter of recommendation.

This man didn’t just say no; he strongly told me to go back home right away and not try to get money. He was sure I wouldn’t get more than enough to pay for my trip.
