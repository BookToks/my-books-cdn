Most of our students came from the countryside, where farming was the main way people made a living. We found out that about eighty-five percent of the Black people in the Gulf states depended on farming to survive. Because of this, we didn’t want to teach our students in a way that would make them lose interest in farm life. We didn’t want them to leave the countryside and move to the cities, trying to live by clever tricks instead of hard work.

We wanted to give them an education that would help many of them become teachers. At the same time, we hoped they would go back to the farms and help the people there bring new energy and ideas to farming. We also wanted them to improve the community’s thinking, morals, and religious life.

All these ideas and needs felt very serious and almost too much to handle. What could we do? We only had a small old shack and an empty church building that the kind Black people of Tuskegee had lent us for classes. More and more students were coming every day. The more we met them and traveled through the countryside, the more we saw that our work was only partly meeting the real needs of the people we wanted to help. We wanted to lift them up by teaching the students who would become leaders.
