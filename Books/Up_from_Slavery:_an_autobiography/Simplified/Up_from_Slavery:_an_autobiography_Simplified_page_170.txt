TEACHING SCHOOL 127 We found that the most of our students came fromthecountrydistricts,whereagriculture in some form or other was the main dependence of the people. We learned that about eighty-fiveper cent of the coloured people intheGulf states depended upon agriculture for their living. Since this was true, we wanted to be careful not to educate our students out of sympathy with agricultural life, so that they wouldbe attractedfromthecountry to the cities, and yield to the temptation of trying to live by their wits. We wanted to give them such an education aswould fit a large proportion of them tobe teachers,andatthe same time cause them to return to the plantation districts and show the people there how to put new energy and new ideas into farming, as well as into the intellectual and moral and religious life ofthe people.
 
 All these ideas and needs crowded themselves upon us with a seriousness that seemed well-nigh overwhelming. What were we to do ? We had only the little old shanty and the abandoned church which the good coloured people of the town of Tuskegee hadkindlyloanedus for the accommodation of the classes. The number of students was increasing daily. The more we saw of them, and themorewe travelled through the country districts, themorewe saw that our effortswere reaching, to 128 UP FROM SLAVERY only a partial degree,the actual needs ofthe people whomwewanted to liftup through the medium of the students whom we should educate and send out as leaders.
