This school was going to be the first one for Black children in that part of Virginia, so it was a really big deal, and everyone was talking about it. The hardest problem was finding a teacher.

A young man from Ohio who could read the newspapers was thought about, but he was too young. While people were still talking about who could teach, another young Black man from Ohio, who had been a soldier, somehow came to town.

They soon found out he was well-educated, and the Black community hired him to teach their first school. There were no free schools for Black people in that area yet, so every family agreed to pay a certain amount each month. The teacher was supposed to "board 'round," which meant staying a day with each family. This wasn’t bad for the teacher because each family tried to give the best food on the day the teacher visited. I remember I always looked forward to the "teacher’s day" at our small cabin.

This whole experience of a whole race starting to go to school for the first time is one of the most interesting stories about how people grow. Not many people who weren’t there can really understand how badly Black people wanted an education.
