The scene was full of historic beauty and deep meaning. "Cold" Boston was alive with the strong passion she always has for doing what is right and true. Lots of people who don’t usually go to public events, even whole families who usually leave town for holidays, filled the place until it was packed. The city was celebrating with hundreds of her best citizens—men and women known for the qualities that make people proud of their city.

Battle music played in the air. People cheered again and again, giving long and warm applause as the officers and friends of Colonel Shaw, the sculptor St. Gaudens, the memorial committee, the Governor and his team, and the Black soldiers of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts came up on the stage or entered the hall. Colonel Henry Lee, who worked with Governor Andrew, gave a simple and noble speech for the committee, honoring Mr. John M. Forbes, who he was representing. Governor Wolcott gave a short but powerful speech, saying, "Fort Wagner marked an important moment in the history of a race and helped it grow up." Mayor Quincy accepted the monument for the city of Boston.

The story of Colonel Shaw and his Black regiment was told in brave and noble words. Then, after the singing of "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord," Booker Washington stood up to speak.
