The time that I was permitted to attend school during the daywas short, and my attendance was irregular. It was not long before I had to stop attending day-school altogether, and devote all of mytime again to work. I resorted to the nightschool again. In fact, the greater part of the education I secured in my boyhood was gathered through the night-school after my day's work was done. I had difficulty often in securing a satisfactory teacher. Sometimes, after I had secured some one to teach me at night, I would find, much to my disappointment, that the teacher knew but little more than I did. Often I would have to walk several miles at night in order to recite my night-school lessons. There was never a time in my youth, no matter how dark and discouraging the days might be,when one resolve did not continually remainwith me, and that was adeterminationtosecure aneducation at any cost.
 
 Soon after we moved to West Virginia, my mother adopted into our family, notwithstanding our poverty, an orphan boy, to whom afterwardwe gave the name of James B. Washington. He has ever since remained amember of the family.
