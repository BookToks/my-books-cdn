The time I was allowed to go to school during the day was short, and I didn’t go regularly. Soon, I had to stop going to day school completely and spend all my time working. So, I went back to night school. Actually, most of the education I got when I was a kid came from night school after I finished my work during the day.

It was often hard to find a good teacher. Sometimes, when I found someone to teach me at night, I was disappointed because they didn’t know much more than I did. Many times, I had to walk several miles at night just to attend my night school lessons. No matter how hard or dark things were, I always had one strong goal—to get an education no matter what it took.

Soon after we moved to West Virginia, my mom took in an orphan boy, even though we were poor. We named him James B. Washington, and he has been part of our family ever since.
