For weeks we not only had to contendwiththedifficulty ofprovidingboard, with no money, but alsowiththat ofproviding sleeping accommodations. For this purpose we rented a number of cabins near the school. These cabins were in a dilapidated condition, and during the winter months the students who occupied them necessarily suffered from the cold. We charged the students eight dollars a monthâ€”allthey were able to pay for their board. This included, besides board, room, fuel, and washing. We also gave thestudents credit on theirboard bills for all thework which theydid for the school which was ofany value to the institution. The cost oftuition,whichwas fifty dollars ayearforeach student, wehadto secure then,as now, wherever we could.
 
 This small charge in cash gave us no capital withwhich to start a boarding department. The weather during the second winter of our work was very cold. We were not able to provide enough bed-clothes to keep the students warm. In fact, for some timewe were not able to provide, except in a few cases, bedsteads and mattresses of any kind. Duringthe coldest nights Iwas so troubled about the discomfort ofthe students that I could notsleepmyself. I recallthat onseveral occasions Iwentinthe middle ofthe night to the shanties 168 UP FROM SLAVERY occupied by the young men, for the purpose of comforting them.
