For weeks, we had a hard time feeding everyone because we had no money. We also had trouble finding places for the students to sleep. So, we rented some cabins near the school. These cabins were old and falling apart, and in the winter, the students who stayed there were very cold.

We charged the students eight dollars a month, which was all they could afford. This fee covered food, a room, fuel for heat, and washing. We also gave students credit on their bills for any work they did that helped the school. The tuition cost was fifty dollars a year for each student, and we had to find that money wherever we could.

The small amount of money we collected wasn’t enough to start a proper boarding program. The second winter was very cold, and we couldn’t provide enough blankets to keep the students warm. For a while, most of them didn’t even have beds or mattresses. On the coldest nights, I was so worried about the students being uncomfortable that I couldn’t sleep. I remember going to their cabins in the middle of the night to check on them and make sure they were okay.
