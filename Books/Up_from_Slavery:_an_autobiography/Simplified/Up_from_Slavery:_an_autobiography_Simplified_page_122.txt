There was also a feeling that knowing even a little bit of Greek and Latin made someone feel really special, almost like they had superpowers. I remember the first Black man I saw who knew some foreign languages seemed like a person everyone wanted to be like.

Most of the people who got some education became teachers or preachers. While many of these were good, hardworking, and kind, a lot of them became teachers or preachers just because it was an easy way to make money. Many teachers could barely write their own names. I remember one teacher who came to our neighborhood looking for a school. People asked him about the shape of the earth and how he would teach kids about it. He said he was ready to teach that the earth was flat or round, depending on what most people wanted to hear.

The ministry (being a preacher) had the biggest problems, and it still does, even though things have gotten better. Many men who were uneducated and sometimes dishonest said they were "called to preach," which caused a lot of trouble.
