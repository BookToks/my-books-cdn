Because of this, many girls ended up making bad choices.  

I often thought it would have been much smarter to give these girls the same amount of mental training.  

I support any kind of training that helps the mind get stronger and smarter, like learning languages or math.  

But at the same time, they should also get the best and most complete training in things like laundry and other similar jobs.
