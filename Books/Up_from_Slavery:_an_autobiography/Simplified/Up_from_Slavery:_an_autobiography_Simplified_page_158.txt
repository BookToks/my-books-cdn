Lunch and dinner were eaten in much the same way as breakfast. The family’s days mostly followed this same routine, except on Saturdays and Sundays. On Saturdays, the whole family would spend at least half a day, sometimes the whole day, in town.

The reason for going to town was probably to shop, but all the shopping the family could afford could have been done in ten minutes by one person. Still, the whole family stayed in town most of the day. They spent a lot of time standing on the streets, and the women often sat around smoking or using snuff.

Sundays were usually spent going to a big meeting. In the counties I visited, most farmers had their crops mortgaged, and many Black farmers were in debt. The state hadn’t built schoolhouses in the country, so schools were usually held in churches or log cabins.

Sometimes, when I was traveling, I found that the school buildings didn’t have any heat for winter. Because of this, a fire had to be made outside, and the teacher and students went in and out of the building to warm up or cool down.
