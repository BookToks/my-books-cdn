Even though he never said it directly, I learned that General Armstrong used this way to introduce me to people in the North. He also wanted to get some money quickly to help build Alabama Hall. A weak or small-minded person might have thought that money coming to Tuskegee would just take away from the Hampton Institute. But General Armstrong never thought like that. He was too big and kind to be selfish or mean.

He knew that the people in the North who gave money wanted to help all Black people, not just one school. The General also understood that the best way to help Hampton was to make it a strong and selfless leader in solving the problems in the South.

About the speeches I was going to give in the North, I remember one piece of advice the General gave me. He said, "Give them an UP FROM SLAVERY idea for every word."
