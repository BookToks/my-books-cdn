I decided right away to go to that school, even though I didn’t know where it was, how far away it was, or how I would get there. All I knew was that I really wanted to go to Hampton.

This idea stayed with me all the time, day and night.

After hearing about the Hampton Institute, I kept working in the coal mine for a few more months. While I was working there, I found out there was a job open in General Lewis Ruffner’s house. He owned the salt furnace and coal mine. His wife, Mrs. Viola Ruffner, was from Vermont and was known for being very strict with her servants, especially the boys. Most boys didn’t stay working for her longer than two or three weeks.

They all said she was too strict and left. But I thought I would rather try working for Mrs. Ruffner than stay in the coal mine. So my mom asked her if I could have the job, and I got hired for $5 a month.

I had heard so much about how strict Mrs. Ruffner was that I was almost scared to meet her and shook when I saw her. But after living with her for a few weeks, I started to understand her better. I learned that she wanted everything clean, things done on time and in order, and most of all, she wanted people to be honest and open with her.
