No one who only sees people by their skin color can understand the best things in life. When I meet people in many places, I notice that the happiest people are those who help others the most. The most unhappy people are those who do the least for others. I have also learned that nothing makes a person so blind and narrow-minded as judging others by their race. I often tell my students during my Sunday talks that the more I live and learn about the world, the more I believe the most important thing in life is to make someone else happier and more useful, even if it means risking your life.

At first, the Black people and Black newspapers were very happy with my speech in Atlanta and how people reacted to it. But after the excitement wore off and they read the speech carefully, some felt like they had been tricked. They thought I was too kind to the white people in the South and that I didnâ€™t speak strongly enough for the "rights" of Black people.
