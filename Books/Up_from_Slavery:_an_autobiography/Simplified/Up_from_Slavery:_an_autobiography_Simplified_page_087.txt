I was really happy to do this. I kept working on the boat for several days. After buying food with the small money I earned, there wasnâ€™t much left to save for my trip to Hampton. To save money in every way I could and make sure I got to Hampton quickly, I kept sleeping under the same sidewalk that gave me shelter the first night I was in Richmond.

Many years later, the Black people of Richmond kindly held a party for me, and about two thousand people came. The party was not far from the place where I slept that first night in the city. I have to admit, my mind was more on the sidewalk that first gave me shelter than on the nice party.

When I had saved what I thought was enough money to get to Hampton, I thanked the captain of the boat for being kind and started my trip again. Nothing unusual happened, and I got to Hampton with exactly fifty cents left to start my education. The trip had been long and full of events, but when I first saw the big, three-story brick school building, it felt like all the hard work was worth it.
