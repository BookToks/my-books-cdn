There was an amazing man; tall and thin, standing straight like a Sioux chief. He had a high forehead, straight nose, strong jaws, and a determined mouth with big white teeth. His eyes were sharp, and he acted like a leader. The muscles on his dark neck showed clearly, and his strong right arm swung high, holding a pencil tightly in his brown fist. His big feet stood firmly, with heels together and toes pointing out. His voice was clear and strong, and he paused impressively after each point.

In just ten minutes, the crowd was full of excitement—people waved handkerchiefs, swung canes, and threw their hats in the air. The most beautiful women of Georgia stood up and cheered. It was like the speaker had magically captured their attention.

When he raised his dark hand high with fingers spread wide, he told the white people of the South for his race, "In all things purely social, we can be as separate as fingers, but one as a hand in all things needed for progress." The loud applause hit the walls, and the whole crowd stood up, cheering wildly. At that moment, I remembered the night Henry Grady spoke among the smoke at Delmonico’s banquet and said, "I am a Cavalier among Roundheads."

I have heard great speakers from many countries, but not even Gladstone could have argued better than this sharp-featured Black man, shining in the sunlight, standing with the men who once tried to keep his people enslaved.
