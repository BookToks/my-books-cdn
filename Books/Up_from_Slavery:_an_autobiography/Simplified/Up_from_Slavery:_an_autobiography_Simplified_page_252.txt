I was invited to speak in Atlanta, but I was only allowed five minutes. I wondered if I could say enough in such a short time to make the trip worth it.

I knew most of the audience would be important white men and women. It was a rare chance to tell them about what we were doing at Tuskegee and to talk about how different races get along. So, I decided to go.

I spoke for five minutes to about two thousand people, mostly white people from the South and North. They seemed to like what I said and were excited. The Atlanta newspapers wrote nice things about my speech, and people talked about it in other parts of the country too. I felt I had done what I wantedâ€”to get the attention of the most powerful people in the South.

After that, more and more people asked me to speak in public. These requests came about equally from my own community and from white people in the North.
