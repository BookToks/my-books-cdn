My invitation to speak in Atlanta stipulated that I was to confine my address to five minutes. The question, then, was whether or not I could put enough into a five-minute address to make it worth while for me to make such a trip.
 
 I knew that the audiencewould be largely composedofthe most influential class ofwhitemen and women, and that it would be a rare opportunity for me to let them knowwhat we were trying to do at Tuskegee, as well as to speak to them about the relations of the races. So I decided to make the trip. I spoke for five minutes to an audience of two thousand people,composed mostly ofSouthern and Northern whites. What I said seemed to be received with favour and enthusiasm. The Atlanta papers ofthe nextday commented in friendly terms onmy address, and agood deal was said about it in different parts ofthe country. I felt that I had in some degree accomplished my objectâ€”that ofgetting a hearing from thedominantclassofthe South.
 
 The demands madeupon me for public addresses continued to increase,coming in about equal numbers frommyownpeopleand fromNorthernwhites.
