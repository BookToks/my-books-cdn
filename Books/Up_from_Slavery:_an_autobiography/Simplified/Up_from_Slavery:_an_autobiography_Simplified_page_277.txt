For a while, some people in my own race didn’t agree with me. But later, those people seemed to change their minds and started to believe and act like I did.

When I think about how people’s opinions changed, I remember something that happened about ten years after the school at Tuskegee was started. Dr. Lyman Abbott, who was the pastor of Plymouth Church and the editor of a magazine called the Outlook, asked me to write a letter for his paper. He wanted my honest opinion about the mental and moral condition of Black ministers in the South, based on what I had seen.

I wrote the letter, telling the truth as I saw it. The picture I gave was pretty negative—or, since I am Black, maybe I should say “white”? It couldn’t be any different for a group of people who had only been free from slavery for a short time, and who hadn’t had the chance to develop strong church leaders.

What I said soon got to almost every Black minister in the country. I got a lot of letters from them, and many of those letters were criticizing me.
