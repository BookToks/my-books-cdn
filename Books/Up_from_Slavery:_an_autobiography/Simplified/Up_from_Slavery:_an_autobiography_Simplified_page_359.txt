A few days after the President got back to Washington, I received this letter:

Executive Mansion, Washington, Dec. 23, 1899.

Dear Sir: I am happy to send you special copies of the souvenir from the Presidentâ€™s visit to your school. These copies have the signatures of the President and the Cabinet members who came with him on the trip.

I want to say congratulations on how well everything went during the events and the entertainment you organized for us when we visited Tuskegee. Every part of the program was done perfectly and everyone who was there really enjoyed it.

The special show you gave of your students working in their jobs was not only creative but also very impressive. The praise from the President and his Cabinet for your work was well deserved and shows good signs for the future success of your school.

I have to add that your humble attitude during the events was noticed and praised by all of us who came.

With best wishes for the continued growth of your important and patriotic work, warm personal regards, and holiday greetings, I remain, always, Very sincerely yours, John Addison Porter, Secretary to the President.

To President Booker T. Washington, Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, Tuskegee, Ala.
