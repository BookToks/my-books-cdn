Back then, not many people believed that Native Americans could learn well or benefit from education. General Armstrong wanted to try teaching a lot of them at once. He brought over one hundred Native Americans from reservations in the Western states. Most of them were young and didn’t know much.

The special job General Armstrong gave me was to be like a "house father" to the Indian young men. That meant I had to live with them and take care of their discipline, clothes, rooms, and other needs. It was a tempting offer, but I was really focused on my work in West Virginia and didn’t want to leave it. Still, I couldn’t say no to General Armstrong.

When I got to Hampton, I lived in a building with about seventy-five Native American youths. I was the only person there who was not Native American. At first, I wasn’t sure if I could do well. I knew that many Native Americans thought they were better than white people, and they also felt they were better than Black people because Black people had accepted slavery, something Native Americans would never do.
