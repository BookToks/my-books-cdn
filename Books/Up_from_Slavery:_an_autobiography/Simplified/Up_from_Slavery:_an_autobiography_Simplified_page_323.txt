There were many important national issues that affected our community at that time, which made it really hard for us to decide to leave. 

We finally promised our friends in Boston that we would go, and they wanted us to pick a departure date quickly. So, we chose May 10. My good friend Mr. Garrison kindly took care of all the details needed to make the trip successful. He and other friends also gave us lots of letters to introduce us to people in France and England and made other plans to make our trip comfortable.

We said goodbye at Tuskegee and were in New York on May 9, ready to sail the next day. Our daughter Portia, who was studying in South Framingham, Massachusetts, came to New York to see us off. Mr. Scott, my secretary, came with me to New York so I could finish some last-minute business before leaving. Other friends also came to say goodbye. 

Just before we got on the steamer, we got a nice surpriseâ€”a letter from two kind ladies saying they would give us money to build a new building to properly house all the industries for girls at Tuskegee.
