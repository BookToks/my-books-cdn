I have worked hard to find out the truth in a calm and professional way.

Recently, someone who says they know a lot claimed that 90% of Black women are not virtuous.

This is the worst kind of lie ever told about a race, and there is no real proof for it.

Anyone who spends twenty years with the Black community, like I have in the South, will see that they are slowly but surely getting better in money, education, and behavior. You could look at the worst people in New York City and say almost anything about white people, but everyone agrees that’s not a fair way to judge.

At the start of 1897, I got a letter asking me to give a speech at the opening of the Robert Gould Shaw monument in Boston. I said yes. I don’t need to explain who Robert Gould Shaw was or what he did.
