He was just another unlucky person caught up in the system that the country had set up back then.

The cabin was not only where we lived but also where the food was made for the plantation. My mom was the cook for the plantation. The cabin didn’t have glass windows; it only had openings on the sides that let light in, but also let in the cold, freezing winter air. There was a door, or at least something called a door, but it was small, had loose hinges, and big cracks, making the room really uncomfortable.

Besides these openings, there was a “cat-hole” in the lower right corner of the room. Almost every house or cabin in Virginia had one before the Civil War. The cat-hole was a small square opening, about seven by eight inches, so cats could go in and out during the night. I never understood why we needed it in our cabin because there were at least six other spots where cats could get through. Our cabin didn’t have a wooden floor; the dirt on the ground was used as the floor.
