I spent as much time as I could giving talks, even though I was busy working at Tuskegee. Most of my talks in the North were to raise money to support the school. When I spoke to Black audiences, my main goal was to show them how important it was to learn industrial and technical skills, along with regular school subjects and religious lessons.

Now, I want to talk about one event in my life that got a lot of attention. It might be the thing that made me famous across the country. This was the speech I gave at the opening of the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 18, 1895.

A lot has been said and written about that speech, and many people have asked me questions about it. So, I hope itâ€™s okay if I explain it in some detail.

The speech in Atlanta only lasted five minutes. I traveled all the way from Boston to give it. That short speech probably helped me get the chance to speak a second time there. In the spring of 1895, I got a telegram from important people in Atlanta asking me to go with a group from their city to Washington, D.C. They wanted me to speak before a Congress committee to help get government support for the Exposition.
