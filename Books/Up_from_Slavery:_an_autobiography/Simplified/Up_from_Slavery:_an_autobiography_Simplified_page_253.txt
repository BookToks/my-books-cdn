206 UP FROM SLAVERY I gaveas much time tothese addresses as I could sparefromthe immediatework atTuskegee. Most of the addresses in the North were made for the direct purpose of getting funds with which to support the school. Those delivered before the coloured people had for their main objectthe impressing upon them ofthe importance ofindustrial and technical education in addition to academic and religious training.
 
 I nowcome to that one of the incidents in my lifewhich seemstohaveexcited thegreatestamount of interest, and which perhaps went further than anything else in giving me a reputation that in a sense might be called National. I refer to the address which I delivered at the opening of the Atlanta Cottonstates and International Exposition, at Atlanta, Ga., September 18, 1895.
 
 So much has been said and written about this incident, and so many questions have been asked me concerning the address, that perhaps I maybe excused fortakingup the matter with some detail.
 
 The five-minute address in Atlanta,which I came from Boston to deliver, was possibly the prime cause for an opportunitybeing given me to make the second address there. Inthespring of1895 I received a telegram from prominent citizens in Atlanta asking me to accompanyacommittee from A FIVE-MINUTE SPEECH 207 that city toWashington forthepurpose ofappearing before acommittee of Congress in the interest of securingGovernment help for the Exposition.
