The most important thing I learned in my second year was how to use and appreciate the Bible. Miss Nathalie Lord, one of my teachers from Portland, Maine, taught me how to love and understand the Bible. Before that, I didn’t care much about it, but then I started to enjoy reading the Bible, not just for spiritual help, but also because it’s good writing.

What I learned stuck with me so much that now, whenever I’m at home, no matter how busy I am, I always make sure to read a chapter or part of a chapter in the morning before starting my day.

I also owe some of my public speaking skills to Miss Lord. When she saw I was interested, she gave me private lessons on breathing, stress, and speaking clearly. I never liked just talking in public for no reason. I think that kind of empty public speaking is boring. Since I was a kid, I wanted to do something to make the world better and then talk to people about it.
