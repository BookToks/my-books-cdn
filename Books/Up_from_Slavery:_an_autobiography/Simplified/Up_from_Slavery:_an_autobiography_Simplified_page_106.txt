Perhaps the most valuable thing thatI got out of my secondyearwasanunderstanding of theuse and valueof the Bible. Miss Nathalie Lord, one ofthe teachers, from Portland, Me., taught me how touseand love the Bible. Before this Ihad never cared a great deal about it, but now I learned to love to read the Bible,not only for the spiritual helpwhichitgives,but onaccountofit asliterature.
 
 The lessons taughtme in this respect took such a holdupon me that at the present time,when I am at home,no matter howbusyI am, I always make it a rule to read a chapter or a portion ofachapter in the morning, beforebeginning the work ofthe day.
 
 WhateverabilityI mayhave as a public speaker I owe in a measure to Miss Lord. When she found out that I had some inclination in this direction, she gave me private lessons inthe matter ofbreathing, emphasis,and articulation. Simplyto be able to talk in public for the sake of talking has never had the least attraction for me. In fact, I consider that there is nothing so empty and unsatisfactory as mere abstract public speaking; but from my early childhood I havehad a desire to do something to make the world better, and then to be able to speak to the world about that thing.
