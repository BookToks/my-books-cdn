Nothing should be messy or careless; every door and fence must be fixed and taken care of.

I can’t remember exactly how long I stayed with Mrs. Ruffner before going to Hampton, but I think it was about a year and a half. I want to say again that the lessons I learned at Mrs. Ruffner’s home were just as important as any other education I’ve ever had.

Even now, when I see trash on the ground or in a house, I want to pick it up right away. If I see a dirty yard, I want to clean it. If a fence is falling down, I want to fix it. If a house isn’t painted or whitewashed, I want to paint it. If a button is missing from someone’s clothes, or there’s a grease spot on clothes or the floor, I want to point it out.

At first, I was scared of Mrs. Ruffner, but soon I started to think of her as one of my best friends. When she saw she could trust me, she trusted me completely. During the winters I stayed with her, she let me go to school for an hour each day for part of the winter, but most of my studying was done at night. Sometimes I studied alone, and sometimes I paid someone to teach me.
