BLACK RACE AND RED RACE 103

I saw something that showed this same feeling later on. I was in a town where people were very angry and upset, and it looked like there might be a lynching. The problem started because a dark-skinned man had stopped at the local hotel.

But after checking, they found out this man was from Morocco and that he spoke English while traveling in the country. When people learned he was not an American Black man, all their anger went away. The man, who had caused the trouble without meaning to, decided it was better not to speak English anymore.

At the end of my first year with the Indians, I got another chance at Hampton. Looking back, it seems like it happened for a reason to help me get ready for my work at Tuskegee later. General Armstrong found out that many young Black men and women really wanted to get an education but were too poor to pay for their meals or books.

He had the idea to start a night school at Hampton. A small number of the most promising young people could join if they worked ten hours during the day and went to school for two hours at night.
