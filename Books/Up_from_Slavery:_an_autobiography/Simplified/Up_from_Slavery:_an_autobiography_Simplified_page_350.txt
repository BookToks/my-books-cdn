A Boston newspaper said: When Harvard University gave an honorary Master of Arts degree to the Principal of Tuskegee Institute, it honored both itself and the person receiving the award. Professor Booker T. Washington has done great work in education, good citizenship, and helping people learn in the South. Because of this, he deserves to be counted among our nation’s important leaders.

The university that can call him one of its own, whether by regular study or honorary degree, should feel proud.

People have said that Mr. Washington is the first Black person to get an honorary degree from a New England university. That alone is special. But he didn’t get the degree just because he is Black or because he was born into slavery. He earned it by working hard to improve the lives of people in the South’s Black Belt, showing great talent and kindness that anyone would respect, no matter their skin color.

Another Boston newspaper said: Harvard is the first college in New England to give an honorary degree to a Black man. Anyone who knows the history of Tuskegee and its work can’t help but admire Booker T. Washington’s courage, determination, and smart thinking.
