The plan itself isn’t new. It was created at Hampton Institute, but it was made by white men there. Many smart people who studied life in the South had already thought about this plan before. Teaching hand skills was common on well-run plantations during slavery. But Tuskegee is still a completely new chapter in the history of Black people and in solving one of the toughest problems we’ve faced.

It doesn’t just teach a man to be a carpenter; it teaches a man how to be a better person. Because of this, it is more valuable than almost any other school for training men and women, from Cambridge to Palo Alto. It’s one of the only places that shows a new way forward for a big part of our country’s life.

Making the plan on paper or from far away is one thing. For a white man to create it is also easy. But for a Black man to make it work in the South, where many people—both Black and white—didn’t understand him, and where he had to deal with very tense race relations, was much harder. The man who did this gave the country something very important that lasts.
