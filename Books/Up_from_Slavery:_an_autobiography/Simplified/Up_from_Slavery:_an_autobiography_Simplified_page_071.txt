I have noted the fact, but without satisfaction, I need not add, that several of the boys who began their careers with "store hats " and who were my schoolmates and used tojoin in the sport that was made of me because I had only a "homespun " cap, have ended their careers in the penitentiary, while others are not able now to buy any kind of hat.
 
 My second difficulty was with regard to my name, or rather a name. From the time when I could remember anything, I had beencalled simply " Booker." Before going to school it had never occurred to me that itwas needful or appropriate to have an additional name. When I heard the school-roll called,I noticedthat all ofthe children had at least two names, and some ofthem indulged inwhat seemed to me the extravagance ofhaving three. I was in deep perplexity, because I knew thatthe teacherwould demand of me at least two names, and I had only one. By the time the occasion came for the enrolling of my name, an idea occurred to me which I thought would make me equal to the situation; and so, when the teacher asked me what my full name was, I calmly told him " Booker Washington," as if I hadbeen called bythat nameall my life; and by that name I have BOYHOOD DAYS 35 since been known.
