I've noticed something, but it doesn't make me happy. Some of the boys who started out wearing "store hats"—they were my school friends and used to make fun of me because I only had a "homespun" cap—ended up in jail. Others can't even afford to buy any kind of hat now.

My second problem was about my name, or really, having a proper name. Ever since I could remember, people just called me "Booker." Before I went to school, I never thought I needed more than one name. When I heard the teacher call attendance, I saw that all the kids had at least two names, and some had three, which seemed like a lot to me.

I was really confused because I knew the teacher would want me to have at least two names, but I only had one. When it was time to give my name, I had an idea that I thought would work. So, when the teacher asked me for my full name, I confidently said, "Booker Washington," like I had always been called that. And from then on, that's the name I've been known by.
