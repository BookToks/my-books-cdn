280 UP FROM SLAVERY During our entire stay of a month in Paris, both the American Ambassador and his wife, as well as several other Americans,were very kind to us.
 
 While in Pariswe saw a good deal ofthe now famous American Negro painter, Mr. Henry O.
 
 Tanner, whom we had formerly known in America. It was very satisfactory to find how well known Mr. Tanner was in the field ofart, and to note the high standingwhich all classes accorded to him. When we told someAmericans thatwe were going to the Luxembourg Palace to see a painting by an American Negro, it was hard to convince them that a Negro had been thus honoured. I do not believe that they were reallyconvinced of the fact until they sawthe pictureforthemselves. My acquaintance with Mr. Tanner reinforced in my mind the truth which I am constantly trying to impressupon ourstudentsatTuskegee—andonour people throughout the country,as far as I canreach them with my voice—that any man, regardless of colour, will be recognized and rewardedjust inproportion as he learns todo somethingwell—learns todo itbetter than some one else—however humble the thing may be. As I have said, I believe that my race will succeed inproportion as it learns to do a common thing in an uncommonmanner ; learns to do a thing so thoroughly that no one can EUROPE 281 improve upon what it has done; learns to make its services of indispensable value.
