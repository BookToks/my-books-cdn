During our whole month in Paris, the American Ambassador and his wife, along with some other Americans, were very nice to us.

While in Paris, we spent time with the well-known American Black painter, Mr. Henry O. Tanner, who we had met before in America. It was great to see how famous Mr. Tanner was in the art world and how much respect people from all backgrounds gave him.

When we told some Americans that we were going to the Luxembourg Palace to see a painting by a Black American, they found it hard to believe. I don’t think they really believed it until they saw the painting themselves.

Knowing Mr. Tanner reminded me of something I always tell my students at Tuskegee and Black people everywhere: anyone, no matter their skin color, will be noticed and rewarded if they learn to do something well—better than anyone else—even if it’s a simple task.

I truly believe my race will succeed as much as it learns to do ordinary things in an extraordinary way; to do something so well that no one can do it better; and to make its work absolutely necessary.
