When he came back from Hampton, we both worked together and saved money to send our adopted brother, James, to the Hampton Institute. We succeeded, and now he works as the postmaster at the Tuskegee Institute. In 1877, which was my second year teaching in Malden, I spent my time much like I did the first year.

While I lived in Malden, the "Ku Klux Klan" was very active. The Ku Klux were groups of men who joined together to control the behavior of Black people. They especially tried to stop Black people from having any say in politics.

They were similar to the "patrollers" I heard about when I was a kid during slavery. The patrollers were groups of mostly young white men who made sure slaves followed rules at night. They stopped slaves from going from one plantation to another without permission and from having meetings unless a white man was there.
