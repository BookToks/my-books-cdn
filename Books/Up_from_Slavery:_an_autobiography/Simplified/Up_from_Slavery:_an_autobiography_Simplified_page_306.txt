In my absence, Mr. Warren Logan, the treasurer, who has been at the school seventeen years, is the executive. He is efficiently supported by Mrs. Washington, and by my faithful secretary, Mr. Emmett J. Scott,who handles the bulkofmy correspondence and keeps me in daily touch with the life of the school, and who also keeps me informed ofwhatever takes place in the South that concerns the race. I owe more to his tact,wisdom, andhardwork than I candescribe.
 
 Themainexecutivework ofthe school,whether I am at Tuskegee or not, centres in what we call theexecutive council. This council meets twice a week, and iscomposedofthe ninepersonswho ate at the head of the nine departments ofthe school.
 
 For example: Mrs. B. K. Bruce, the Lady Principal, the widow ofthe late ex-senator Bruce, is a member ofthecouncil,and represents initall that pertains tothe life of the girls at the school. In addition to the executive council there is afinancial committee ofsix,that meets everyweek anddecides upon the expenditures for the week. Once a month, and sometimes oftener, there is a general meeting of all the instructors. Aside from these there are innumerable smaller meetings, such as 260 UP FROM SLAVERY that of the instructors in the Phelps Hall Bible Training School, or of the instructors in the agricultural department.
