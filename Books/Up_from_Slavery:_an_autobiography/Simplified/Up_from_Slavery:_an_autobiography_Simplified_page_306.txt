While I am away, Mr. Warren Logan, the treasurer who has worked at the school for seventeen years, is in charge. He gets great help from Mrs. Washington and my loyal secretary, Mr. Emmett J. Scott. Mr. Scott handles most of my letters and keeps me updated every day about whatâ€™s happening at the school and in the South with our race. I am very thankful for his smart thinking, hard work, and care.

The main work of running the school, whether I am there or not, is done by the executive council. This group meets twice a week and includes nine people who lead the nine main departments of the school.

For example, Mrs. B. K. Bruce, the Lady Principal and widow of the late Senator Bruce, is on the council. She takes care of everything related to the girls at the school. Besides the executive council, there is a financial committee of six people that meets every week to decide how money will be spent. Once a month, and sometimes more often, all the teachers have a big meeting. There are also many smaller meetings, like those for teachers in the Phelps Hall Bible Training School or the agricultural department.
