I ate and slept with the people in their small cabins. I saw their farms, schools, and churches. Since most of the time they didn’t know I was coming, I got to see their real, everyday life.

In the plantation areas, I found that usually the whole family slept in one room. Sometimes, other relatives or people who weren’t family also slept there. More than once, I had to go outside to get ready for bed or wait until the family went to sleep. They usually made a place for me to sleep, either on the floor or part of someone else’s bed. There was rarely a place inside the cabin to wash even your face and hands, but usually there was a spot outside in the yard for this.

The people mostly ate fat pork and cornbread. Sometimes, I ate in cabins where they only had cornbread and black-eyed peas cooked in plain water. The people didn’t seem to think much beyond eating this fatty meat and cornbread — which they bought at a high price from a store in town. This was even though the land around their homes could easily grow almost any kind of garden vegetables.
