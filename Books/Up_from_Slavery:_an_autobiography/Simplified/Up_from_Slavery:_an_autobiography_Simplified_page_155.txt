I ate and slept with the people,intheir little cabins. I saw their farms, their schools, their churches. Since,in the case of themost of these visits, there had been no notice given in advance that a strangerwasexpected, I hadthe advantage of seeing the real, everyday life of thepeople.
 
 Intheplantationdistricts I found that, as arule, thewholefamilyslept in one room,andthat inaddition to the immediate family there sometimes were relatives, or others not related to the family, who slept in the same room. On more than one occаsion I went outside the house toget ready for bed, or towaituntil the family had gonetobed. They usually contrived some kind of a place for me to sleep, either on the floor or in aspecial partof another's bed. Rarelywas there anyplace provided inthe cabin where one could bathe even the face and hands, but usually some provision was made for this outside the house, in the yard.
 
 The common diet ofthe peoplewas fat pork and corn bread. At times I have eatenincabins where they had only corn bread and "black-eye peas" cooked inplainwater. The people seemed tohave no other idea than tolive on this fatmeatand corn bread,—the meat,andthe meal ofwhich the bread was made, havingbeenboughtat a high price at a EARLY DAYS AT TUSKEGEE 113 store in town,notwithstanding the fact that the land all about the cabin homes could easily have been made to produce nearly everykind ofgarden vegetable that is raised anywhere in the country.
