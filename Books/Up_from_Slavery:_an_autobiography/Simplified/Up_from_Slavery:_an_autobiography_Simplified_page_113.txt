At that place, I first learned what it means to live a life without thinking only about myself. I found out that the happiest people are the ones who help others and make them happy.

When I graduated, I had no money at all.

Along with other students from Hampton, I got a job as a table waiter at a summer hotel in Connecticut. I borrowed enough money to get there. I soon realized I didnâ€™t know much about waiting tables at a hotel. But the head waiter thought I was really good. He gave me a table with four or five rich and fancy guests. I was so bad at waiting on them that they got angry and scolded me hard. I got scared and left their table without serving their food.

Because of this, I was moved down from waiter to dish carrier.

But I decided to learn how to wait tables, and after a few weeks, I got better and was put back in my old job. I felt proud about that.
