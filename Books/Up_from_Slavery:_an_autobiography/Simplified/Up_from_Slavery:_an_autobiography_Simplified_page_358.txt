The problem, I say, has been solved. Today, we saw a picture that should be painted and hung next to pictures of Washington and Lincoln. It should be shared all over the country. It was a very powerful picture: The President of the United States standing on this stage; on one side the Governor of Alabama, and on the other, a leader from a race that had been enslaved only a few years ago—the Black President of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute.

God bless the President who made this moment possible. God bless Alabama, which is showing it can handle this problem on its own. God bless the speaker, helper, and follower of the Great Teacher—Booker T. Washington, who would be doing the same work if he were alive today.

Postmaster General Smith ended his speech with these words: We have seen many amazing things in the past few days. We have seen the beautiful success of a great Southern city. We have seen heroes from the war march by. We have seen flower parades. But I am sure my friends will agree that nothing has been more impressive, hopeful, or inspiring for our future than what we saw here this morning.
