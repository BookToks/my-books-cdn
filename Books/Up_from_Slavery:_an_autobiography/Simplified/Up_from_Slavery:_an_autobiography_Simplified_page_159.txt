Most of the teachers in these country schools were really bad at their jobs and didn’t have good morals. The schools only ran for three to five months each year. There was almost no equipment in the schoolhouses, except sometimes a rough blackboard.

One day, I went into a schoolhouse—or actually an old, empty log cabin being used as a school—and found five students sharing one book. Two kids in the front were sharing the book, two behind them were peeking over their shoulders, and a fifth little kid was trying to see over all four of them.

What I said about the schoolhouses and teachers also fits the church buildings and ministers there.

I met some interesting people while traveling. To show how country people think, I asked a sixty-year-old Black man to tell me about his life. He said he was born in Virginia and was sold into Alabama in 1845.
