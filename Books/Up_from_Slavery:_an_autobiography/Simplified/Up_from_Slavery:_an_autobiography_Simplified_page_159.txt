With few exceptions, I found the teachers in these countryschools to be miserably poor in preparation for their work, and poor in moral character. The schools were in session from three to five months. There was practically no apparatus in the schoolhouses, except that occasionally therewas a rough blackboard. I recall that one day I went into aschoolhouseâ€”or rather into an abandoned logcabinthatwas being used as a schoolhouse and found five pupils who were studying a lesson from one book. Two of these, on the front seat, were using the book between them; behind these were two others peeping over theshoulders of the first two,and behind the four was a fifth little fellow who was peeping over the shoulders of all four.
 
 What I have said concerning the character of the schoolhouses and teacherswill also applyquite accurately as a description ofthe church buildings and the ministers.
 
 I met some veryinteresting charactersduring my travels. As illustratingthepeculiarmental processes ofthe country people, I remember that I asked one coloured man, who was about sixty years old, to tell me something of his history. He saidthat he had EARLY DAYS AT TUSKEGEE 117 been born in Virginia, and sold into Alabama in 1845.
