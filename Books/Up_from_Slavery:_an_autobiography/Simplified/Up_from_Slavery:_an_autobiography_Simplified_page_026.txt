The thousand young men and women around me were innocent victims of this problem. I was also an innocent victim. The whole country was hurt by the big mistake of bringing Africa into America.

I strongly believed that the country should stick to the idea of fair voting. But I remembered how badly Reconstruction had ruined things. I thought about the poor state of public life in all the "black" States. Every kind act seemed to fail, every attempt to fix problems seemed unsure, and the racial tension seemed to get worse.

Here was the old problem, full of sadness, sitting right in front of me. Who was more to be felt sorry forâ€”these innocent victims of a long-ago wrong, or me and men like me who had to deal with this problem?
