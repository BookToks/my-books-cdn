During my first years at Tuskegee, I remember lying awake every night, unable to sleep because I was so worried about money. I knew we were trying something new—seeing if Black people could start and run a big school. I also knew that if we failed, it would hurt the whole race. People didn’t expect us to succeed.

If white people started something like this, everyone would just assume they’d do well. But for us, I felt people would be shocked if we made it.

All this made me feel really stressed, like a heavy weight pressing down on me.

Even with all these problems and worries, I never asked for help from anyone in Tuskegee—white or Black—without getting some help. More than a dozen times, when bills were hundreds of dollars and needed to be paid, I asked white men in Tuskegee for small loans. Sometimes, I borrowed small amounts from as many as six different people to cover what we owed.
