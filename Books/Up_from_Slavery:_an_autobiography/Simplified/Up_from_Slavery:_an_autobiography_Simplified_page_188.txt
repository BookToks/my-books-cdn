During the firstyears at Tuskegee I recall that night after nightIwould roll and toss on my bed,without sleep, because of the anxiety and uncertainty which we were in regarding money. I knew that, in a large degree, we were trying an experimentâ€”that of testing whether or notitwas possible for Negroes to build up and control the affairs of alarge educational institution. I knew that if we failed it would injure the whole race. I knew that the presumptionwas againstus.
 
 I knew that in the caseof white people beginning such anenterpriseitwould betaken forgrantedthat theywere going to succeed,but in our case I felt that people would be surprised if we succeeded.
 
 All this made a burden which pressed down on us, sometimes, it seemed,atthe rate of athousand pounds to the square inch.
 
 In all our difficulties and anxieties, however, I never went to awhite or a black personinthe town of Tuskegee for any assistance that was in their power to render, without being helped according to theirmeans. More than a dozen times, when bills figuring up intothe hundreds ofdollars werefalling 146 UP FROM SLAVERY due, I applied to the white men ofTuskegee for small loans,oftenborrowingsmall amountsfrom as manyas a half-dozen persons,to meet our obligations.
