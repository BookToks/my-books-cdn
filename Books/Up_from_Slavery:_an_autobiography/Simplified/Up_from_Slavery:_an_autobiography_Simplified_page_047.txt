I remember one time I saw two of my young mistresses and some lady visitors eating ginger-cakes in the yard. Back then, those cakes looked like the most delicious and wanted things I had ever seen. I decided right then that if I ever became free, my biggest goal would be to get and eat ginger-cakes just like they did.

As the war went on, white people often found it hard to get food for themselves. I think the slaves felt it less because their usual food was cornbread and pork, which could be grown on the plantation. But things like coffee, tea, sugar, and other things the white people liked couldn’t be grown there. The war made it even harder to get those things. The white people were often in big trouble. They used parched corn for coffee and a kind of black syrup instead of sugar.

Many times, they didn’t use anything to sweeten their tea or coffee at all.
