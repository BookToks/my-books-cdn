Back then, there weren’t many buildings, and space was really limited. I shared a room with seven other boys, most of whom had been there for a while. The sheets confused me at first. On the first night, I slept under both sheets, and the next night I slept on top of both. But by watching the other boys, I figured out the right way and have been trying to follow it and teach others ever since.

I was one of the youngest students at Hampton at that time. Most of the students were adults, some even as old as forty. Looking back on my first year, I don’t think people often get to be around so many men and women who were as serious about learning as these people were. Every hour was spent studying or working. Almost all of them had enough real-life experience to understand why education was so important. 

Many older students found it hard to fully understand the textbooks, which was sad to see, but they made up for it with how determined they were. A lot of them were as poor as I was, and besides struggling with their studies, they also had to deal with poverty that made it hard to get the basic things they needed to live.
