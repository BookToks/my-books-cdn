During the year I spent in Washington, and a little before that, there was a lot of talk in West Virginia about moving the state capital from Wheeling to a more central place. Because of this, the Legislature chose three cities for people to vote on as the new capital. One of these cities was Charleston, which was only five miles from Malden, where I lived.

At the end of my school year in Washington, I was happy to get an invitation from a group of white people in Charleston to help promote the city across the state.

I said yes and spent almost three months speaking in different parts of West Virginia.

Charleston won and became the new state capital.

Because I did well as a speaker during this campaign, some people wanted me to go into politics. But I said no, still thinking I could help my race better in other ways.
