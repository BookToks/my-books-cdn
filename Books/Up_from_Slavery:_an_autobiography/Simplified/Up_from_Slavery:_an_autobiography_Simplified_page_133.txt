CHAPTER VI BLACK RACE AND RED RACE DURING the yearthat I spent in Washington, and for some little time before this, there had been considerable agitation in the state of West Virginia over the question of moving the capital of the state from Wheeling to some other central point. As a result of this, the Legislature designated threecities tobe voted upon bythe citizens of the state as the permanent seat ofgovernment. Among these cities was Charleston, only five miles from Malden, my home. At the close of my school year in Washington I was very pleasantly surprised to receive, from a committee of white people inCharleston, an invitation to canvass the state in the interests of that city.
 
 This invitation I accepted, and spent nearly three months in speaking in various parts of the state.
 
 Charlestonwas successful inwinning the prize, and is nowthe permanent seat ofgovernment.
 
 The reputation that Imade as a speaker during this campaign induced a number of persons to 92 BLACK RACE AND RED RACE 93 make anearnest effort to get me to enter political life, but I refused, still believing that I could find other service which would prove of more permanentvalue to my race.
