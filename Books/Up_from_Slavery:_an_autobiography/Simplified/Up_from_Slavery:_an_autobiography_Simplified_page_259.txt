I was equally determined to be true to the North, as well asto the best element of the white South, inwhat I had to say.
 
 The papers, North and South,had taken up the discussion of my coming speech, and as the time for it drew near this discussion became more and more widespread. Not a few ofthe Southern white papers were unfriendly to the idea of myspeaking.
 
 From my own race I receivedmany suggestions as towhat I ought to say. Iprepared myself as best I could for the address,but as the eighteenth of September drew nearer, the heavier my heart became, and themore I feared that my effort would prove afailure and adisappointment.
 
 The invitation had come at a time when I was very bus/ with my school work, as it was the beginning of our school year. After preparing my address, I went through it, as I usually do with all those utterances which I consider particularly important, with Mrs. Washington, and she approved of what I intended to say. On the sixteenth of September, theday before Iwas to start forAtlanta, so many of the Tuskegee teachers expressed a desire to hear my address that I consented to read it to them in a body. When I haddone so, and had A FIVE-MINUTE SPEECH 213 heard their criticisms and comments, I felt somewhat relieved, since they seemed to think well of what I had to say.
