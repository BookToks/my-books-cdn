I was just as determined to be honest with the North as I was with the best people in the white South when I spoke.

The newspapers, both in the North and South, started talking about my upcoming speech. As the day got closer, more and more people were discussing it. Some Southern white newspapers didnâ€™t like the idea of me speaking.

People from my own race gave me lots of advice on what I should say. I worked hard to get my speech ready, but as September 18 got closer, I felt heavier inside and worried that my speech might fail or disappoint.

The invitation came when I was really busy with school because it was the start of our school year. After I finished writing my speech, I went over it with Mrs. Washington, who approved what I planned to say. On September 16, the day before I was leaving for Atlanta, many teachers at Tuskegee wanted to hear my speech, so I read it to them all. After listening to their feedback, I felt better because they seemed to like what I said.
