The history of the world doesnâ€™t show a better, kinder, or more selfless group of men and women than those who started those Black schools.

Life at Hampton was always surprising to me; it kept showing me a new world. Things like eating meals at set times, using a tablecloth and napkin, taking baths, brushing teeth, and having sheets on the bed were all new to me.

I think one of the most important lessons I learned at Hampton was how to use and appreciate a bath. It taught me how baths help keep the body healthy, build self-respect, and encourage good behavior. Since leaving Hampton, I have always tried to take a bath every day. Sometimes, when visiting my own people in a small one-room cabin, it was hard to find a way to bathe except by sneaking off to a stream in the woods. I have always tried to teach my people that every house should have a way to bathe.

While I was a student at Hampton, I only had one pair of socks. When they got dirty, I would wash them at night and hang them by the fire to dry so I could wear them again the next day.
