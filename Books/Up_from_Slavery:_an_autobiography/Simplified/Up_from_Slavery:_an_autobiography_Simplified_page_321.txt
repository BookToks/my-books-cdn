I had been working at Tuskegee for eighteen years, and I never thought about doing anything else with my life.  

Every day, the school needed me more and more to pay its bills. I told my friends from Boston that, even though I was really thankful for their kindness and help, I couldn’t go to Europe because the school wouldn’t survive without me. Then they told me that Mr. Henry L. Higginson and some other friends, who wanted to stay anonymous, were raising enough money to keep the school running while I was gone. At that moment, I had no choice left. Every way out was blocked.  

Deep inside, the whole thing felt like a dream, not real life. For a long time, it was hard for me to believe I was actually going to Europe. I was born and raised mostly in the worst parts of slavery, ignorance, and poverty. When I was a kid, I didn’t have a place to sleep or enough food, clothes, or shelter. I didn’t even get to sit at a dining table until I was almost grown. Fancy things always seemed like they were only for white people, not for people like me.
