Now they gradually threw offthe mask, and were not afraid toletit be known that the "freedom" in their songs meant freedom of the body in this world. The night before the eventful day, word was sent to the slave quarters to the effect that something unusual was going to take place at the "big house" the next morning.
 
 There was little, if any, sleep that night. All was excitement and expectancy. Earlythe next morning word was sent to all the slaves, old and young, to gather at the house. In company with my mother, brother, and sister, and a large number of other slaves, I went to the master's house. All of our master's family were either standing or seated on the veranda of the house, where they could see what was to take place and hear what was said. There was a feeling of deep interest, or perhaps sadness, on their faces, but not bitterness.
 
 As I now recallthe impression theymadeupon me, they did not at the moment seem to be sad because of the loss of property, but rather because of partingwith those whomthey had reared andwho were in manyways very close to them. The most distinct thing that I now recall in connectionwith the scene was that some man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper- A SLAVE AMONG SLAVES 21 the Emancipation Proclamation, I think.
