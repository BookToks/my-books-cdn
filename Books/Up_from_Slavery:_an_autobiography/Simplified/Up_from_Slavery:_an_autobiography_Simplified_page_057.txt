Now they started to show their true feelings and weren’t scared to say that the "freedom" in their songs meant being free in their bodies in this world. The night before the big day, a message was sent to the slave quarters saying that something special was going to happen at the "big house" the next morning.

Almost no one slept that night. Everyone was excited and waiting for what was coming. Early the next morning, a message told all the slaves, young and old, to come to the house. I went with my mother, brother, sister, and many other slaves to the master's house. The master's family was either standing or sitting on the porch so they could see and hear what was going on. Their faces looked very interested, or maybe sad, but not angry.

Now that I think about it, they didn’t seem sad because they were losing property. They seemed sad because they were saying goodbye to people they had raised and who were close to them in many ways. The main thing I remember was a man who looked like a stranger (probably a United States officer) gave a short speech and then read a long paper—the Emancipation Proclamation, I think.
