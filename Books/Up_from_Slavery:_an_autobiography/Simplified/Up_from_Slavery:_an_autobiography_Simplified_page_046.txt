The mail carrier, on his way back to our master's house, would naturally share the news he heard from the slaves. This way, they often found out about important events before the white people at the "big house," which was the master's house.

I can’t remember a single time when my whole family sat down to eat together, said a prayer, and had a proper meal. On the plantation in Virginia, and even later, kids got their meals kind of like animals. It was a piece of bread here and a bit of meat there. Sometimes a cup of milk, other times some potatoes.

Sometimes part of our family ate straight from the skillet or pot. Others ate from a tin plate on their knees, often just using their hands to hold the food.

When I was big enough, I had to go to the "big house" at mealtime to fan the flies away from the table using big paper fans on a pulley. A lot of the white people’s talk was about freedom and the war, and I listened carefully and learned a lot.
