The mail-carrier on his way back to our master's house would as naturally retail the news that he had secured among the slaves, and in thisway they often heard of important events before the white people at the "big house," as the master's house was called.
 
 I cannot remember a single instance during my childhood or early boyhood when our entire family satdown to the table together, and God's blessing was asked, and the family ate a meal in a civilized manner. On the plantation in Virginia, and even later, meals were gotten by the children very much as dumb animalsgettheirs. Itwas a piece ofbread here and a scrap of meat there. Itwas a cup of milk at one time and some potatoes at another.
 
 Sometimes a portion ofour family would eat out of the skillet or pot, while some one else would eat from a tinplateheld on the knees, and often using nothing butthe hands with which to hold the food.
 
 When I had grown to sufficient size, I was required to go to the " big house" at meal-times to fan the flies from the tableby means ofa large set of paper fans operated by a pulley. Naturallymuch of the UP FROM SLAVERY 10 conversation of thewhite people turned upon the subject of freedom and thewar, and I absorbed a gooddeal ofit.
