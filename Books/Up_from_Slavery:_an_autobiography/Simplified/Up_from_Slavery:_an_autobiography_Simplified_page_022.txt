INTRODUCTION

The story of Mr. Washington's early life, as he honestly tells it in "Up from Slavery," doesn’t show everything about his education. He got the kind of training that Black kids received at Hampton, and the book does explain this.

But the reader doesn’t get the full picture of how he became so smart because Mr. Washington himself might not fully understand it either. The truth is, he got a very special kind of training during the most important time of his life. Not many men of his time had this chance.

To understand it better, you have to start in the Hawaiian Islands more than fifty years ago. There, Samuel Armstrong, whose parents were missionaries, saved enough money to pay for college in America. With this money and a lot of determination, he went to Williams College when Dr. Mark Hopkins was the president.

Williams College had many good things for young people back then, just like it does now, but the best thing was the strong character of its famous president.
