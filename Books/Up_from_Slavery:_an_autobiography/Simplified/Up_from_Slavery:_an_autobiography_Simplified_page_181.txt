After three months, we had saved enough money to pay back the $250 loan to General Marshall. Then, in two more months, we had the full $500 and got the deed for 100 acres of land. This made us very happy. It felt good not only to have a permanent place for the school but also because most of the money came from both white and Black people in Tuskegee. We raised most of the money by holding festivals, concerts, and from small donations.

Next, we worked on growing more crops to get some income from the land and to teach students how to farm. All the work at Tuskegee started naturally, based on what the community needed. We began with farming because we needed food.

Many students could only stay in school for a few weeks at a time because they didnâ€™t have enough money to pay for food and housing.

So, another goal was to start an industrial system to help students earn money. This way, they could afford to stay in school for the full nine months of the school year.
