What is just as important is that they are showing common sense and self-control. This is helping different races get along better. It is also helping Southern white people see the value of educating Black men and women.

Wherever our graduates go, you can see changes like buying land, fixing homes, saving money, getting an education, and having good morals. Whole communities are quickly changing because of these men and women.

Ten years ago, I started the first Negro Conference at Tuskegee. This meeting happens every year and now brings 800 to 900 Black men and women to the school. They spend the day learning about the real industrial, mental, and moral conditions of the people and making plans to improve things. From this main Negro Conference at Tuskegee, many state and local meetings have started doing the same work. Because of these meetings, one delegate said at the last annual meeting that ten families in his community had bought and paid for their own homes.
