I think it would be hard to make this advice any better, and it can be used for all kinds of public speaking. Since then, I have always tried to remember his advice.

Meetings were held in New York, Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia, and other big cities. At these meetings, General Armstrong and I asked for help—not for Hampton, but for Tuskegee. We especially tried to get support to build Alabama Hall and to tell people about the school. These meetings worked well for both things.

After that friendly start, I began going North by myself to raise money. For the last fifteen years, I have had to spend a lot of time away from the school to find money to meet the school’s growing needs. While raising money, I had some experiences that might interest you. Many times, people who were trying to raise money for good causes asked me what rules I followed to get people interested and willing to help.

If raising money can be broken down into rules, I would say I have only two rules.
