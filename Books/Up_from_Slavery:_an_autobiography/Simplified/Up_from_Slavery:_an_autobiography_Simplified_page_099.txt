60 UP FROM SLAVERY After having been for a while at Hampton, I found myself in difficulty because I did not have books and clothing. Usually, however, I got around the trouble about books by borrowing from those who were more fortunate than myself. As to clothes, when I reached Hampton I had practically nothing. Everything that I possessedwas in a small hand satchel. My anxiety about clothing was increasedbecause ofthefactthat General Armstrong made a personal inspection of the young men in ranks,to see that their clothes were clean.
 
 Shoes had to be polished,theremust be no buttons offthe clothing, and nogrease-spots. To wear one suit ofclothes continually,while atwork and inthe schoolroom, and atthe same timekeep itclean, was rather a hard problem for me to solve. In some way Imanaged to get on till the teachers learned that I was in earnest and meant to succeed, and then some of them were kind enough to see that I was partly suppliedwith second-hand clothing that had been sent in barrels from the North. These barrels proved ablessing to hundreds of poor but deserving students. Without them I question whether I should ever have gotten through Hampton.
 
 When I firstwent to Hampton I do not recall that I had ever slept in a bed that had two sheets THE STRUGGLE FOR AN EDUCATION 61 on it.
