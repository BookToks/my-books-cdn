After being at Hampton for a while, I had some problems because I didn’t have books or clothes. Usually, I solved the book problem by borrowing from people who had more than me. When I got to Hampton, I had almost nothing for clothes. Everything I owned fit in a small bag. I was worried about clothes even more because General Armstrong checked to make sure the young men’s clothes were clean.

Shoes had to be shiny, there couldn’t be any buttons missing, and no grease stains. Wearing just one set of clothes all the time, both at work and in class, and keeping them clean was really hard for me. Somehow, I got by until the teachers saw I was serious and wanted to do well. Then some of them helped me get second-hand clothes sent from the North in barrels. These barrels helped hundreds of poor but hardworking students. Without them, I’m not sure I would have finished Hampton.

When I first came to Hampton, I don’t remember ever sleeping in a bed with two sheets on it.
