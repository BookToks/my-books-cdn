The Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute is a great school with a strong reputation that is growing all over the country and even known in other countries. I want to congratulate everyone involved for the good work they are doing in teaching students to live honest and useful lives, making the race it was created for proud.

I believe there is no better place for this special school experiment, which has caught the attention and support of even careful donors from all parts of the country.

It’s impossible to talk about Tuskegee without recognizing Booker T. Washington’s smart ideas and hard work. He started this important project and deserves a lot of credit. His energy and business skills helped the school grow steadily and reach the high level it has today. He is known as a great leader of his people, respected both here and around the world as a skilled teacher, speaker, and generous helper.

The Honorable John D. Long, the Secretary of the Navy, said: “I can’t make a speech today because my heart is too full—full of hope, respect, and pride for all my fellow Americans, both black and white. I’m thankful and impressed by your work, and from now on I will fully believe in your progress and the solution to the problem you are working on.”
