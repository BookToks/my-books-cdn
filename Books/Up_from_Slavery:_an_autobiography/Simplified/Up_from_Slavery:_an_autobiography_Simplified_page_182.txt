The first animal the school got was an old blind horse given to us by a white man from Tuskegee. Right now, the school owns more than two hundred animals like horses, young horses, mules, cows, calves, and oxen. We also have about seven hundred pigs and a lot of sheep and goats.

The school kept growing, so after we paid for the farm, started farming the land, and fixed the old cabins we found, we decided to build a big, strong building. After thinking a lot about it, we made plans for a building that would cost around six thousand dollars. This seemed like a huge amount to us, but we knew the school had to move forward, or it would fall behind. Our work wouldn't matter much unless we could connect with the students in their home lives.

One event that happened around this time made me feel very happy and surprised.
