The people he lives and works with will think carefully before letting go of a man like him.

A person who can do something the world needs will succeed no matter their race. One man might go to a community ready to teach people about Greek sentences. The community might not want or need that at first, but they might need bricks, houses, or wagons. If the man can provide those things, then later the community will want the Greek lessons too. When they want it, they will understand it and benefit from it.

When we finally made our first bricks, students started to complain more about having to work. By then, it was well known across the state that every student who came to Tuskegee, no matter how much money they had, had to learn a trade. Many parents wrote letters saying they didnâ€™t want their children to work while at school. Some parents even came to the school to say this in person.
