The work was really hard and tiring, but I didn’t give up. I had a lot of rooms to take care of and had to work late into the night. At the same time, I had to get up by four o’clock in the morning to build the fires and have some time to get my lessons ready. During my whole time at Hampton, and even after I left, Miss Mary F. Mackie, the head teacher I mentioned before, was one of my best and most helpful friends. Her advice and support always helped me, especially when things were really tough.

I already talked about how the buildings and the look of Hampton Institute impressed me, but I haven’t said what made the biggest and most lasting impression on me. That was a great man—the kindest and most amazing person I’ve ever had the chance to meet. I’m talking about the late General Samuel C. Armstrong.

I’ve been lucky to meet many important people in both Europe and America, but I’m not afraid to say that I never met anyone who I thought was as great as General Armstrong. Coming from the harsh life on slave plantations and in coal mines, it was a special honor for me to meet him.
