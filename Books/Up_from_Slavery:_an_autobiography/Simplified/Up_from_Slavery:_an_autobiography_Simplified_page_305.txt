It was important, so I quickly got dressed and went downstairs. When I got to the hotel office, I saw a calm and innocent-looking person waiting for me. He said, "I heard you speak at a meeting last night. I liked your talk, so I came this morning to hear you speak more."

People often ask me how I can manage the work at Tuskegee and still be away from the school so much. Part of the answer is that I have learned to ignore the old saying, "Don’t ask others to do what you can do yourself."

My own rule is, "Don’t do what others can do just as well." One good thing about the Tuskegee school is that it is organized so well that the daily work doesn’t depend on just one person being there.

The whole team, including teachers and office workers, now has eighty-six people. This team is divided and organized so well that the school runs smoothly every day like clockwork. Most of our teachers have been with the school for many years and care about it as much as I do.
