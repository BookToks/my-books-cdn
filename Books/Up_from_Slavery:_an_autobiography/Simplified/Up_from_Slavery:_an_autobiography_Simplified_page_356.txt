Just before the arrival ofthe President's party the Legislature arrived, headed by the governor and other state officials.
 
 The citizens of Tuskegee had decorated thetown from the station to the school in a generous manner. In order to economize inthe matter oftime, we arranged to have thewholeschool pass inreview before the President. Each student carried astalk of sugar-cane with some open bolls of cotton fastened to the end of it. Following the students the work of all departments of the school passed in review, displayed on "floats" drawn by horses, mules, and oxen. On these floats we tried to exhibit not only the present work of the school, but to show the contrasts between the old methods of doing things and the new. As an example, we showed the old method of dairying in contrast with the improved methods, the old methods of tilling the soil in contrast with the new, the old methods of cooking and housekeeping in contrast with the new. These floats consumed an hour and a half oftime in passing.
 
 In his address in our large, new chapel, which the students had recently completed, the President said, among other things: â€” To meetyou under such pleasant auspices and to have the opportunity of apersonal observation ofyourwork is 308 UP FROM SLAVERY indeed mostgratifying.
