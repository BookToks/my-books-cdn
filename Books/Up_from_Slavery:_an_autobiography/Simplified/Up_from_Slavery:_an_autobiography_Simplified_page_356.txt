Just before the President’s group arrived, the Legislature came first, led by the governor and other state officials.

The people of Tuskegee had decorated the town nicely all the way from the station to the school. To save time, we planned for the whole school to pass in front of the President. Each student carried a stalk of sugarcane with some open cotton bolls tied to the end.

After the students, the work from all parts of the school was shown on “floats” pulled by horses, mules, and oxen. On these floats, we tried to show not only what the school was doing now but also how things used to be done compared to how they are done now. For example, we showed the old way of dairy farming next to the new, better way, the old way of farming the soil next to the new way, and the old way of cooking and housekeeping next to the new way. These floats took an hour and a half to pass by.

In his speech in our big, new chapel, which the students had just finished building, the President said, among other things: — Meeting you all in such a friendly way and getting the chance to see your work up close is really great.
