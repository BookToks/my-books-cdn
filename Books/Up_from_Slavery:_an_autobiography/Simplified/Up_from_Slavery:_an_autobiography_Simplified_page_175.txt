Several festivals were held, and they raised a good amount of money. People from both races were also asked to give money directly, and most of them gave small amounts. It was often very touching to see the gifts from older Black people, many of whom had spent their best years as slaves. Sometimes they gave five cents, sometimes twenty-five cents.

Sometimes the gift was a quilt or a bunch of sugarcane. I remember one old Black woman, about seventy years old, who came to see me while we were raising money to pay for the farm. She walked into the room leaning on a cane. Her clothes were old but clean. She said, "Mr. Washington, God knows I spent the best days of my life in slavery.

God knows I'm poor and don’t know much, but," she added, "I know what you and Miss Davidson are trying to do. I know you want to make better men and women for the Black race. I don’t have any money, but I want you to take these six eggs I’ve been saving and use them for the education of these boys and girls." Since Tuskegee started, I have received many gifts for the school, but none has touched me as much as this one.
