132 UP FROM SLAVERY Several of these festivals were held,and quite a little sum of money was raised. A canvass was also made among thepeople ofboth races fordirect gifts of money, and mostof those applied togave small sums. Itwas often pathetic to notethe gifts of the older coloured people, most of whom had spent their best days in slavery. Sometimes they would give five cents,sometimes twenty-five cents.
 
 Sometimes the contributionwas a quilt, or a quantityofsugarcane. I recall oneold colouredwoman, whowas about seventyyears of age,who came to see mewhen wewere raising moneytopayfor the farm. She hobbled into the room where I was, leaning on acane. She was clad in rags; but they were clean. She said : " Mr. Washinton, God knows I spent de bes' days of mylife in slavery.
 
 God knows I's ignorant an' poor; but," she added, " I knows what you an' Miss Davidsonistryin' to do. I knows you is tryin' tomake bettermen an' betterwomen for de coloured race. I ain't got no money, but I wants you to take dese sixeggs, what I's been savin' up, an' I wantsyou to put dese six eggs into de eddication ofdese boys an' gals." Since the work at Tuskegee started, it has been my privilege to receive many gifts for the benefit of the institution, but never any, I think, that touched me so deeply as this one.
