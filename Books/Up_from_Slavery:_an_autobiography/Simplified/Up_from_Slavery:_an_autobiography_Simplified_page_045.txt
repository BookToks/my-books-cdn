These talks showed that they understood what was going on and kept themselves updated by using what they called the "grapevine" telegraph.

During the campaign when Lincoln first ran for President, the slaves on our far-away plantation, miles from any railroad, big city, or daily newspaper, knew what the main issues were.

When the war started between the North and the South, every slave on our plantation felt and knew that, even though other things were talked about, the main issue was slavery. Even the most uneducated people on the faraway plantations felt deep down, without any doubt, that if the Northern armies won, the slaves would gain their freedom.

Every victory by the Federal armies and every loss by the Confederate forces was watched with the most interest. Often, the slaves found out the results of big battles before the white people did. This news usually came from the Black man who was sent to the post office to get the mail.

In our case, the post office was about three miles from the plantation, and the mail came once or twice a week. The man sent to the office would hang around long enough to hear what the white people talking there had to say about the news they just got.
