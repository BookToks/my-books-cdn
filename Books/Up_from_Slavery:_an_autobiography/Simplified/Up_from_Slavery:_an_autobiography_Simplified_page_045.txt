These discussions showedthat they understood the situation, and that they kept themselves informed of events by what was termed the "grape-vine" telegraph.
 
 During the campaign when Lincoln was first a candidate for the Presidency, the slaves on our far-offplantation,milesfromany railroad or largecity or daily newspaper, knew what the issues involved When war was begun between the North were.
 
 and the South, every slave on our plantation felt and knew that, though other issues were discussed, the primal one was that ofslavery. Even the most ignorant members ofmy race on the remote plantations feltintheirhearts,withacertaintythatadmitted ofno doubt, that thefreedomoftheslaves would be theonegreatresultofthewar,ifthe Northern armies conquered. Every successofthe Federalarmies and every defeat of the Confederate forces was watched with the keenest and most intense interest. Often theslavesgotknowledgeoftheresultsofgreatbattles before the white people received it. This news was usually gotten from the coloured man who was sent to the post-office for the mail. In our case the post-office was about three miles from the plantation, and the mail came once or twice a week. The A SLAVE AMONG SLAVES 9 manwho was sent to the office would linger about the place long enough to get the drift of the conversation from the group of white people who naturally congregated there, after receiving their mail, to discuss the latest news.
