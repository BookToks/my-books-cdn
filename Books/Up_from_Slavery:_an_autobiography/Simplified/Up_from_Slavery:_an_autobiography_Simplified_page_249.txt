In this address I said that the whole future of the Negro rested largely upon the question as to whether or not he should make himself, through his skill, intelligence, and character, of such undeniable value to the community in which he lived that the community could not dispense with his presence. I said that any individual who learned todo somethingbetterthan anybody elseâ€”learned todoa common thing in an uncommon manner -had solved his problem, regardless ofthe colour ofhis skin, and that in proportion as the Negro learned to producewhat other people wanted and must have, in the same proportion would he be respected.
