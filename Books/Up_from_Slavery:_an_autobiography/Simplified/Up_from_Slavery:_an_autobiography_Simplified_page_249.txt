In this speech, I said that the future of Black people depends a lot on whether they can make themselves so valuable through their skills, smarts, and character that their community can’t do without them. I said that anyone who learns to do something better than anyone else—doing a normal thing in an unusual way—has solved their problem, no matter their skin color. The more Black people learn to make things that others want and need, the more they will be respected.

I talked about one example where a graduate grew 266 bushels of sweet potatoes on one acre of land, in a place where the usual amount was only 49 bushels per acre. He did this because he understood the chemistry of the soil and knew better farming methods.

The white farmers nearby respected him and asked him for advice about growing sweet potatoes. These white farmers honored him because, through his skill and knowledge, he made the community richer and more comfortable.
