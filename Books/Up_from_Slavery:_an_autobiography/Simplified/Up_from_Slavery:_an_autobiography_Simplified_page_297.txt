The monument to his memory stands near the top of Boston Common, facing the State House. It is considered the best piece of art of its kind in the country.

The dedication ceremony took place in Music Hall, Boston, which was completely full of one of the most important audiences the city has ever seen. Many people there were from the old anti-slavery group, a gathering that might never happen again. The Governor of Massachusetts, the late Hon. Roger Wolcott, led the event. Many other officials and hundreds of important men were also on the stage.

A report in the Boston Transcript described the event better than I can: The main part of the meeting was the amazing speech by the Black President of Tuskegee.

"Booker T. Washington got his honorary degree from Harvard last June," said Governor Wolcott. "He was the first Black person to get this from the oldest university in the country, because of his smart leadership." When Mr. Washington stood up in the flag-filled, excited, and patriotic hall, people felt that he showed the true meaning of Massachusetts' old fight against slavery. He was proof of their strong and lasting faith, and his powerful speech was like a proud symbol of the hard times and struggles from the past.
