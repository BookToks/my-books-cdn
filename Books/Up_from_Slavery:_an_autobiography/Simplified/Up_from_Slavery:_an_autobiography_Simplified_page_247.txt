Without me knowing, there were a lot of people from Alabama at the meeting, including some from Tuskegee.

These white people later told me that they came expecting to hear the South being criticized, but they were happy to find that I didn’t say anything bad about it.

Instead, I gave the South credit for the good things it had done. A white lady who was a teacher at a college in Tuskegee even wrote to the local paper saying she was glad and surprised that I praised the white people of Tuskegee for helping start the school.

This speech in Madison was the first time I talked a lot about race problems. The people who listened seemed to like what I said and agreed with me.

When I first moved to Tuskegee, I decided to make it my home. I promised to be proud of the good things people in the town did, just like any white man would be. At the same time, I would be upset about any bad actions, just like any white man. I also promised never to say anything in the North that I wouldn’t say in the South.
