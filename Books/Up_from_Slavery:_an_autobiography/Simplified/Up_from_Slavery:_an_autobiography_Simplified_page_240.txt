RAISING MONEY 193 In my efforts to get money I have often been surprised atthe patience anddeep interest of the ministers, who are besieged on every hand and at all hours of theday forhelp. If no other consideration had convinced me ofthe value ofthe Christian life, the Christlike work which the Church of all denominations inAmerica has done during the last thirty-five years for the elevation of the black man would have made me aChristian. In alargedegree it has been the pennies,the nickels,and the dimes which have come from the Sunday-schools, the Christian Endeavour societies, and the missionary societies, as well as from the church proper, that have helped to elevatethe Negro at so rapid a rate.
 
 This speaking of small gifts reminds me to say that very few Tuskegee graduates fail to send us an annual contribution. These contributions range from twenty-fivecents up to tendollars.
 
 Soon after beginning our third year's work we were surprisedto receive money from three special sources, and up to the present time we have continued to receivehelp from them. First, the State Legislature of Alabama increasedits annual appropriation fromtwothousanddollars tothreethousand dollars; I might add that still laterit increased this sum to four thousand five hundred dollars a year.
 
 The effort to secure this increase was led by the UP FROM SLAVERY 194 Hon.
