She worked really hard all the time for the work she loved so much from early on. During our married life, we had two bright, beautiful boys, Booker Taliaferro and Ernest Davidson. The older one, Booker, has already learned the brickmaker's trade at Tuskegee.

People often ask me how I started public speaking. I would say I never planned to spend a big part of my life speaking in public. Iâ€™ve always wanted to do things, not just talk about doing them. It seems that when I went North with General Armstrong to speak at some public meetings, the President of the National Educational Association, Hon. Thomas W. Bicknell, was there and heard me speak.

A few days later, he invited me to give a speech at the next meeting of the Educational Association in Madison, Wisconsin. I said yes to the invitation.

This was, in a way, the start of my public speaking career.

The night I spoke before the Association, there must have been almost four thousand people there.
