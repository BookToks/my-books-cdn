My brother John helped me all that he could, but of course thatwasnot agreatdeal, for his work was in the coal-mine,where hedid not earn much, and most ofwhathedid earnwent in the direction of payingthe household expenses.
 
 Perhaps the thing that touched and pleased me mostinconnectionwith mystarting for Hampton was the interest that many of the older coloured people took in the matter. They had spent the best days of their lives in slavery, and hardly expected tolive tosee the timewhen they would see a member of their race leave home to attend a boarding-school. Some of these older people would give me a nickel, others a quarter, or a handkerchief.
 
 Finally the great day came, and I started for Hampton. I had onlyasmall,cheap satchel that containedwhat fewarticles ofclothing Icould get.
 
 My mother at thetimewas rather weak and broken inhealth. I hardlyexpected to seeher again, and thus ourpartingwas all the more sad. She, however,was very brave through it all. At that time therewere no through trains connecting that part of West Virginiawith easternVirginia. Trains ran only a portion ofthe way, and the remainder of the distance was travelled bystage-coaches.
