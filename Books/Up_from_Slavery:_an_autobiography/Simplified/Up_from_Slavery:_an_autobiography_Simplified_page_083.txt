My brother John helped me as much as he could, but it wasn’t a lot because he worked in a coal mine where he didn’t make much money. Most of the money he earned went to pay for our household bills.

What made me happiest about going to Hampton was how much the older Black people cared about it. They had spent most of their lives as slaves and didn’t think they’d live to see someone from our race go away to a boarding school. Some of them gave me a nickel, others gave me a quarter, or a handkerchief.

Finally, the big day came, and I left for Hampton. I only had a small, cheap bag with the few clothes I could bring.

My mom was very weak and sick at the time. I didn’t think I’d see her again, so saying goodbye was really hard. But she was very brave. Back then, there were no trains going all the way from West Virginia to eastern Virginia. The trains only went part of the way, and the rest of the trip was by stagecoach.
