To stay connected with what's happening at the school, I have a system of reports that make sure I get updates every single day, no matter where I am in the country. These reports tell me even which students are excused from school and why, like if they are sick or for other reasons. 

From these reports, I also know how much money the school makes each day. I find out how much milk and butter come from our dairy, what the teachers and students are eating, whether certain meats are boiled or baked, and if the vegetables served are bought from a store or grown on our farm.

People are pretty much the same everywhere, and sometimes it’s tempting to grab rice that’s already ready to cook from a barrel instead of going out to the field to dig up and wash sweet potatoes. Those sweet potatoes could be cooked in a way that works just as well as the rice.
