Inorder that I maykeep inconstanttouchwith the life ofthe institution,I have asystem ofreports so arranged that a record of the school's work reaches me every day in the year, no matter in what part of the country I am. I know by these reports evenwhatstudents are excused from school, andwhy they are excused—whether for reasons of ill health or otherwise. Through the medium ofthese reports I knoweach daywhatthe income of the school in money is; I know how many gallons of milk and how many pounds of butter come from the dairy; what the bill of fare for the teachers and students is; whether a certain kind of meat was boiled or baked, and whether certain vegetables served in the dining room werebought from a store or procured from our own farm.
 
 Human nature I find to bevery much the same the world over, and it is sometimes not hard to yield to the temptation togo to a barrel of rice that has come from the store—with the grain all prepared to go into the pot—rather than to take the time and trouble to go to the field and dig and wash one's own sweet potatoes,which might be prepared inamanner to take the place ofthe rice.
