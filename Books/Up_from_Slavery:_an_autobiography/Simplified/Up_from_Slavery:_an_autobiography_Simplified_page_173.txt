The fact of mybeing responsible for the repaying of such a large amount of money weighed very heavily uponme.
 
 I lost no time in getting ready to move the school on to the new farm. At the time we occupied the place there were standing upon it a cabin, formerly used as the dining room, an old kitchen, a stable, and an old hen-house. Within a few weeks we had all of these structures in use.
 
 The stable was repaired and used as a recitationroom, andvery presently the hen-housewas utilized for the same purpose.
 
 I recall that one morning, when I told an old coloured man who lived near,and who sometimes helped me, that our school had grown so large that itwould be necessary for us to use the hen-house forschool purposes, and that Iwanted him to help me give it a thorough cleaning out the next day, he replied, in the most earnest manner: " What you mean, boss ? You sholy ain't gwine clean out de hen-house in de day-time? " Nearly all the work ofgetting the new location ready for school purposes was doneby the students after school was over in the afternoon. As soon as wegot the cabins inconditionto be used, I determined to clear up some landso thatwe could plant TEACHING SCHOOL 131 acrop.
