I felt really stressed because I was responsible for paying back such a large amount of money.

I quickly got ready to move the school to the new farm. When we first arrived, there was a cabin that used to be the dining room, an old kitchen, a stable, and an old hen-house. Within a few weeks, we started using all these buildings.

We fixed the stable and used it as a classroom, and soon after, the hen-house was used for classes too.

One morning, I told an old Black man who lived nearby and sometimes helped me that our school had grown so much we needed to use the hen-house for classes. I asked him to help clean it out the next day. He replied seriously, "What do you mean, boss? You really want to clean out the hen-house during the day?"

Most of the work to get the new place ready for school was done by the students after classes in the afternoon. Once the cabins were ready to use, I decided to clear some land so we could plant crops.
