I know about times when former slaves have given money to their old owners for years to help them not suffer. I also know other cases where former slaves helped pay for the education of the children of their old owners.

On a big farm in the South, there is a young white man whose father used to own the farm. He has become poor and out of control because of drinking. Even though the Black people on the farm are also poor, they have been helping this young man for years. One person gives him a little coffee or sugar, another gives him some meat, and so on. Nothing the Black people have is too good for the son of "old Mars' Tom," who might never have to suffer as long as anyone who knew "old Mars' Tom" is still there.

I have said that very few people from my race have ever betrayed a trust.

One good example I know is about an ex-slave from Virginia whom I met not long ago in a small town in Ohio.
