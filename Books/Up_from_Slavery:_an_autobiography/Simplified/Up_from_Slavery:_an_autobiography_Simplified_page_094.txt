I was lucky to meet General Armstrong in person. The first time I saw him, he seemed like a perfect man to me. There was something about him that felt almost superhuman. I got to know him personally from the time I started at Hampton until he died, and the more I saw him, the more I admired him.

If you took away all the buildings, classrooms, teachers, and workshops at Hampton, but still let people meet General Armstrong every day, that alone would be a great education. As I get older, I believe more and more that meeting and learning from great people is even better than studying from books or expensive tools.

Instead of just reading books all the time, I wish schools and colleges would focus more on learning about real people and the world around us!

In the last six months of his life, General Armstrong stayed at my home in Tuskegee for two months. By then, he was paralyzed and had lost much control over his body and voice. Even with his illness, he worked almost nonstop day and night for the cause he had dedicated his life to.
