The Indians in Indian Territory owned a lot of slaves during the time of slavery. People also thought that trying to teach and change the Native Americans at Hampton would not work. Because of this, I was very careful and felt a big responsibility. But I was determined to do well.

Soon, the Indians trusted me completely. I think they even liked and respected me. I learned that they were just like anyone else. They liked being treated kindly and didn’t like being treated badly. They often tried to do things to make me happy and comfortable. 

The things they didn’t like were cutting their long hair, stopping wearing their blankets, and quitting smoking. But white Americans often think that no other group is truly civilized unless they wear white people’s clothes, eat their food, speak their language, and follow their religion.

When I took away the problem of learning English, I found that learning trades and school subjects was about the same for both colored and Indian students.
