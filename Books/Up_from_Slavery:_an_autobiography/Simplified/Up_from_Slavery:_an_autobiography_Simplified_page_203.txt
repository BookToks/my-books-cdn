Seeing the new building made it a Thanksgiving day they would never forget.

Mr. Bedford agreed to be one of the school’s trustees, and he has worked with the school in that role for eighteen years. During that time, he has cared about the school all the time and is happiest when he is helping, no matter how small the job. He doesn’t think about himself and always wants to help with the tasks that others don’t want to do. In all my time knowing him, he has seemed to me to be one of the most selfless and kind people I have ever met.

A little later, a young man fresh from Hampton joined the school’s team. Without him, the school wouldn’t be what it is today. This was Mr. Warren Logan, who has been the school’s treasurer for seventeen years and acted as principal when I was away. He has always been unselfish and smart with money, helping keep the school in good shape no matter how long I was gone. Even during tough financial times, he stayed patient and believed the school would succeed.
