CHAPTER II  
BOYHOOD DAYS  

After freedom came, almost everyone on our land agreed on two things. This was true in many parts of the South too. First, they wanted to change their names. Second, they wanted to leave the old plantation for a few days or weeks so they could really feel free.  

Many Black people felt it wasn’t right to keep the last names of their old owners. So, a lot of them chose new last names. This was one of the first signs of being free.  

When they were slaves, Black people were often called just "John" or "Susan." Usually, that was enough. If "John" or "Susan" belonged to a white man named "Hatcher," sometimes they were called "John Hatcher," or "Hatcher’s John."  

But people felt that "John Hatcher" or "Hatcher’s John" wasn’t the right name for a free person. So, many changed "John Hatcher" to something like "John S."
