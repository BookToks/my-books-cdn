Dear Mr. Washington: Would you like to be one of the Judges of Award in the Education Department at Atlanta? If yes, I will gladly add your name to the list. Please send a quick reply by telegraph.

Yours truly, D. C. Gilman.

I think I was even more surprised to get this invitation than when I was asked to speak at the opening of the Exposition. As a juror, I would have to judge not only the exhibits from the Black schools but also those from the white schools.

I accepted the job and spent a month in Atlanta doing the work it required. The group of jurors was large, with sixty members in total. About half were white people from the South, and the other half were white people from the North. The group included college presidents, top scientists, writers, and experts in many fields.

When the jurors I was with met to organize, Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, who was part of the group, suggested I be made secretary of that division. Everyone agreed with the idea.
