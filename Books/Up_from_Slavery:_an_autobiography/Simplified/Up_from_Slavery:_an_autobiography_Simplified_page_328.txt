Elizabeth Cady Stanton kindly helped us find a place to stay. We had just settled in Paris when I got an invitation from the University Club of Paris to be their guest at a banquet. Other guests included ex-President Benjamin Harrison and Archbishop Ireland, who were also in Paris.

The American Ambassador, General Horace Porter, was in charge of the banquet. I gave a speech that seemed to please the audience. General Harrison talked a lot about me and the work at Tuskegee during his dinner speech. After my speech, I got more invitations, but I turned most down because I wanted to focus on my visit. I did agree to speak at the American chapel the next Sunday morning. General Harrison, General Porter, and other important Americans were there.

Later, the American Ambassador formally invited us to a reception at his home. At this party, we met many Americans, including Justices Fuller and Harlan from the U.S. Supreme Court.
