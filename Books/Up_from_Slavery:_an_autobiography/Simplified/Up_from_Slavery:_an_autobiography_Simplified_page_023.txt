Every student does not profit by a great teacher; but perhaps noyoung man ever came underthe influence of Dr. Hopkins whose whole nature was so ripe for profit by such an experience as young Armstrong. He lived in the family of President Hopkins, and thus had a training that was wholly out of the common; and this training had much to do with the development of his own strong character, whose originality and force we are only beginning to appreciate.
 
 In turn, Samuel Armstrong, the founder of Hampton Institute, took up his work as a trainer ofyouth. He had very raw material, anddoubtless most of his pupils failed toget thegreatest lessons from him; but, as hehad been a peculiarly receptive pupil of Dr. Hopkins, so Booker Washington became a peculiarly receptive pupil of his. To the formation of Mr. Washington's character,then, went the missionary zeal of New England, influenced by one of the strongest personalities in modern education, and the wide-reaching moral earnestness of General Armstrong himself. These influences are easily recognizable in Mr. Washington to-day by men who knew Dr. Hopkins and General Armstrong.
