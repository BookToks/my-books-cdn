Not every student benefits from having a great teacher, but maybe no young person was better ready to learn from Dr. Hopkins than young Armstrong. He lived with President Hopkins' family, so he got a special kind of education that was very different from most. This helped him build a strong character that we are only starting to fully understand.

Later, Samuel Armstrong, who started Hampton Institute, began teaching young people. His students were not very experienced, and many probably didn’t learn everything he wanted to teach. But just like Dr. Hopkins had been a great teacher for him, Armstrong became a great teacher for Booker Washington.

Booker Washington’s character was shaped by the strong values of New England, passed down from Dr. Hopkins, and by the deep commitment of General Armstrong. People who knew Dr. Hopkins and General Armstrong can still see these influences in Booker Washington today.
