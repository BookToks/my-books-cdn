At the end of my first year at Hampton, I faced a big problem. Most students went home for vacation. I didn’t have any money to go home, but I still had to go somewhere. Back then, very few students were allowed to stay at school during vacation. It made me feel really sad and homesick to see everyone getting ready to leave.

Not only did I have no money to go home, I didn’t have money to go anywhere else either.

Somehow, I had gotten an extra, used coat that I thought was pretty valuable. I decided to sell it to get some money for travel.

I was proud and tried to hide from the other students that I had no money and nowhere to go. I told a few people in the town of Hampton about the coat, and after a lot of convincing, one Black man said he would come to my room to look at the coat and maybe buy it.
