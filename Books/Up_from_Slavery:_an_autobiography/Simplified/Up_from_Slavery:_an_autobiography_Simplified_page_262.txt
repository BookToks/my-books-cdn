Early in the morning, a group came to take me to my spot in the parade that was going to the Exposition grounds. The parade had important Black citizens riding in carriages and several Black military groups. I noticed that the Exposition officials made sure all the Black people in the parade were treated well and stood in the right places. The parade took about three hours to reach the grounds, and the sun was shining very hot on us the whole time. When we got there, the heat and my nervousness made me feel like I might faint and that my speech might not go well.

When I went into the room for the audience, it was completely full of people from floor to ceiling, and thousands more were outside because they couldnâ€™t get in.

The room was very big and good for public speaking. When I entered, the Black part of the crowd cheered loudly, and some white people cheered quietly. While I was in Atlanta, I was told that many white people would come just because they were curious. Some would support me, but a bigger group was there hoping I would mess up or say something silly. They wanted to say to the people who invited me, "I told you so!"
