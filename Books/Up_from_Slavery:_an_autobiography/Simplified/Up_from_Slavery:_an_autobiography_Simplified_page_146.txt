These students showed so much earnestness, both in their hard work during the day, as well as in their application to their studies at night, that I gave them the name of " The Plucky Class " —a name which soon grew popular and spread throughout the institution. After a student had been in the night-school long enough to provewhat was in him, I gave him a printed certificatewhich read something like this:— "This is to certify thatJamesSmith is amember ofThe Plucky Class ofthe Hampton Institute, and is ingood and regular standing." The students prized these certificates highly, and they added greatly to the popularity of the nightschool. Within a fewweeks this department had grown to such an extent that there were about twenty-five students in attendance. I havefollowed the course of many of these twenty-five men and women ever since then,and they are now holding important and useful positions in nearly every part oftheSouth. The night-school at Hampton,which started with only twelve students,now numbers between three and four hundred,and is oneofthepermanentandmostimportantfeaturesoftheinstitution.
