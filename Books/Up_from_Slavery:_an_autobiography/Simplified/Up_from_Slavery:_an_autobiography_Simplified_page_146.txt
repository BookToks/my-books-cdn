These students worked really hard during the day and also studied a lot at night. Because of this, I called them "The Plucky Class." This name became popular and spread all over the school.

After a student had been in the night school long enough to show what they could do, I gave them a certificate. It said something like this: "This is to certify that James Smith is a member of The Plucky Class of the Hampton Institute and is in good and regular standing." The students loved these certificates, and they made the night school more popular.

In just a few weeks, about twenty-five students were coming to the night school. I have kept track of many of these twenty-five men and women since then, and now they have important and useful jobs all over the South.

The night school at Hampton started with only twelve students. Now, it has between three and four hundred students and is one of the most important parts of the school.
