At the same time, she stayed very involved with the work at Tuskegee as the lady principal and a classroom teacher. Besides this, she also helped older people in and around Tuskegee and taught a Sunday school class in town. She was never very strong, but she never seemed happy unless she was giving all her energy to the cause she loved. Many nights, after going door to door all day trying to get people interested in the work at Tuskegee, she was so tired she couldn’t even undress herself. A woman in Boston later told me that once when Miss Davidson came to see her, she had to wait a little before being let in. When the woman finally saw her, Miss Davidson was so exhausted she had fallen asleep.

While we were building our first building, called Porter Hall after Mr. A. H. Porter from Brooklyn, N.Y., who gave a big donation, we really needed money. I promised one of our creditors that we would pay him four hundred dollars on a certain day. But that morning, we didn’t have a single dollar. The mail arrived at school at ten o’clock, and in that mail was a check sent by Miss Davidson for exactly four hundred dollars.
