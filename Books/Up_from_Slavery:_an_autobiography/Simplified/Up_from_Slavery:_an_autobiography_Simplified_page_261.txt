"I'm definitely going to hear him." Atlanta was really crowded then, with people from all over the country, plus representatives from other countries, and lots of military and community groups. The afternoon newspapers had big, bold headlines predicting what would happen the next day. All this made me feel even more stressed, and I didn't sleep much that night.

The next morning, before it got light, I carefully went over what I planned to say. I also knelt down and asked God to help me do well.

I should say that I always make it a rule never to speak in front of any crowd without asking God to bless what I want to say.

I also always prepare specially for each speech because no two crowds are exactly the same. I try to connect with each group and speak to their hearts, like I’m having a personal talk with them.

When I’m talking to a crowd, I don’t worry about how my words will sound in the newspapers, to another crowd, or to any one person. At that moment, the people in front of me get all my attention, care, and energy.
