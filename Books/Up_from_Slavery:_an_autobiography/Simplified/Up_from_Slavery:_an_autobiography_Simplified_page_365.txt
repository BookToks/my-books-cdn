There are two reasons: the men and women who come here to learn really want to, and everyone is always busy. Here’s what a typical day looks like:

At 5 a.m., the bell rings to wake everyone up. At 5:50 a.m., there’s a warning bell for breakfast, and at 6 a.m., breakfast starts. By 6:20 a.m., breakfast is finished, and from 6:20 to 6:50 a.m., everyone cleans their rooms. At 6:50 a.m., the work bell rings, and at 7:30 a.m., there’s a morning study hour. At 8:20 a.m., the school bell rings, and at 8:25 a.m., the young men line up for inspection. At 8:40 a.m., there are devotional exercises in the chapel, and at 8:55 a.m., everyone spends five minutes with the daily news. Class work starts at 9 a.m. and ends at 12 noon.

At 12:15 p.m., it’s time for lunch. At 1 p.m., the work bell rings again, and class work begins at 1:30 p.m. Classes finish at 3:30 p.m. At 5:30 p.m., the bell rings to stop work, and supper is at 6 p.m. At 7:10 p.m., there are evening prayers, followed by evening study hours at 7:30 p.m. Study ends at 8:45 p.m. At 9:20 p.m., there’s a warning bell for bedtime, and at 9:30 p.m., the final bell to go to bed rings.

We always remember that the school’s value is shown by its graduates. If you count those who finished the full course and those who got enough training to do good work, at least six thousand men and women from Tuskegee are now working in different parts of the South. These men and women are helping their communities improve their lives in practical, educational, moral, and religious ways.
