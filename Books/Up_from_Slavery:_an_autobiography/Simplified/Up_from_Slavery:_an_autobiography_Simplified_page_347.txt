In the line, there were also different officers and professors wearing caps and gowns.

We marched in this order to Sanders Theatre. After the usual graduation activities, the honorary degrees were given out. This part is always the most exciting at Harvard. No one knows who will get the honorary degrees until they walk up, and the students cheer for them based on how popular they are. During this time, everyone is very excited and loud.

When my name was called, I stood up, and President Eliot gave me the Master of Arts degree in clear and strong English. After the ceremony, those who got honorary degrees were invited to have lunch with the President. After lunch, we lined up again and were led by the Marshal of the day, who was Bishop William Lawrence that year. We walked around the grounds, and at different spots, the honored people were called by name and got the Harvard cheer. This march ended at Memorial Hall, where the alumni dinner was served.
