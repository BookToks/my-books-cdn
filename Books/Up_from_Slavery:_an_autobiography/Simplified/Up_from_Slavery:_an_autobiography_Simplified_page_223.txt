Wearing the nightgown was just as important.

For a long time, one of the hardest things was to teach the students to keep all their buttons on their clothes. They also had to make sure there were no holes or grease stains.

Iâ€™m happy to say that this lesson has been learned so well and passed down from one group of students to the next. Now, when the students leave chapel in the evening and their clothes are checked every night, not a single button is missing.
