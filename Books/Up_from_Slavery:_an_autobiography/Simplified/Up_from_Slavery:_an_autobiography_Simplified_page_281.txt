Nearly half of our division were Southern people. In performing my duties in the inspection of the exhibits of white schools I was in every case treated with respect, and at the close of our labours I parted from my associates with regret.
 
 I am often asked to express myself more freely than I do upon the political condition and the political future of my race. These recollections ofmyexperience inAtlanta give me the opportunity to do so briefly. My own beliefis,although I have neverbefore saidso insomanywords, that the time will come when the Negro in the South will be accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and material possessions entitle him to. I think, though,that the opportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in any large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that they will protect him in the exercise of those rights.
 
 Justas soonasthe South gets over the oldfeeling that it is being forced by"foreigners," or "aliens," to do something which it does not want to do, I believe that the change inthedirection that I have THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS 235 indicated is going to begin.
