Almost half of the people in our group were from the South. When I checked the exhibits at the white schools, everyone treated me with respect. At the end of our work, I felt sad to say goodbye to my teammates.

People often ask me to talk more openly about the political situation and future for Black people. My time in Atlanta gives me a chance to share my thoughts quickly. I believe that one day, Black people in the South will have all the political rights they deserve because of their skills, character, and money.

I think this chance to use their political rights wonâ€™t come mostly from outside pressure. Instead, Southern white people will give and protect these rights themselves.

As soon as the South stops feeling like "outsiders" are forcing it to change, I believe the progress I talked about will start.
