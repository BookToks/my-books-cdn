I feel sorry from the bottom of my heart for any country or group of people unlucky enough to get caught in slavery. I have long stopped feeling angry at Southern white people because of the slavery of my race. No one part of our country was completely to blame for starting it, and for many years the government allowed and protected it.

Once slavery became part of the country’s economy and society, it was very hard to get rid of. When we stop being biased or thinking about race, and look at the truth, we have to admit that even though slavery was cruel and wrong, the ten million Black people living in this country—who went through slavery themselves or whose ancestors did—are in a better place physically, mentally, morally, and spiritually than the same number of Black people anywhere else in the world.

This is so true that Black people here, who were once slaves or whose families were slaves, often go back to Africa as missionaries to help the people who stayed there. I’m not saying this to say slavery was okay—in fact, I strongly condemn it because in America it was started for selfish money reasons, not to help anyone—but to point out a fact and show how sometimes life uses people and events to make something good happen.
