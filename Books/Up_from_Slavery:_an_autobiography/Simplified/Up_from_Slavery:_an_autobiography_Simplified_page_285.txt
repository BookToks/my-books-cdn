CHAPTER XV THE SECRET OF SUCCESS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING

To show how my speech in Atlanta was received by the crowd at the Exposition building, I think it’s best to let Mr. James Creelman, a famous war reporter, explain. Mr. Creelman was there and sent this report to the New York World:

Atlanta, September 18.

While President Cleveland was waiting at Gray Gables to start the machines at the Atlanta Exposition, a Black man named Moses spoke in front of a big group of white people. His speech marked a new time in the history of the South. Also, a group of Black soldiers marched with the citizen soldiers from Georgia and Louisiana.

The whole city was excited that night because these two events were very important and had never happened before. Nothing like this has happened since Henry Grady’s famous speech to the New England society in New York, which showed the spirit of the New South — except maybe the opening of the Exposition itself.
