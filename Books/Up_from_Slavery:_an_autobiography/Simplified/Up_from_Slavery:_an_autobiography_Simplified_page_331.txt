Anyone who keeps adding something good to the place they live—whether it’s through ideas, kindness, or work—won’t go unnoticed for long. This is a strong rule about people that can’t be changed forever.

I noticed that the French really love fun and excitement. I think they enjoy life more than the people from my own background. When it comes to being serious and moral, I don’t think the French are better than Americans like me. Because life is tough and competitive in France, they have learned to be more careful and work harder. But I believe people from my background in America will get there too. 

When it comes to honesty and respect, I don’t think the average French person is better than an African American. Also, I believe my people care more about animals. When I left France, I felt more hopeful about the future of black people in America than ever before.

After Paris, we went to London and arrived in early July, right in the middle of the busy social season. Parliament was meeting, and there was a lot of fun and excitement everywhere.
