68 UP FROM SLAVERY The debating societies at Hamptonwere aconstant source of delight to me. These were held on Saturday evening; and during mywhole life at Hampton I do not recall that I missed a single meeting. I not only attended theweeklydebating society, but was instrumentalin organizing an additional society. I noticed that between the time when supper was over and the timeto begin evening study there were about twentyminutes which theyoungmen usuallyspent inidlegossip. About twenty of us formed a society for the purpose of utilizing this time in debate orin practice inpublic speaking. Fewpersons ever derived more happiness or benefit from the use of twentyminutes of timethanwe did in this way.
 
 At the end of my second year at Hampton, by the help of some money sent me by my mother and brother John, supplemented by a small gift from oneoftheteachersat Hampton, Iwas enabled to return to my home in Malden, West Virginia, to spend my vacation. When I reached home I found that the salt-furnaces were not running, and that the coal-mine was not being operated on account ofthe miners being outon a "strike." This was something which, it seemed, usually occurred whenever the men got two or three months ahead in their savings. During the strike, ofcourse, they HELPING OTHERS 69 spent all that they had saved, and would often return to work in debt at the samewages, or would move to another mine at considerable expense.
