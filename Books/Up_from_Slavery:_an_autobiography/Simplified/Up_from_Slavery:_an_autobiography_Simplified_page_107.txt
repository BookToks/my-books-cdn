The debating clubs at Hampton were always a lot of fun for me. They happened on Saturday nights, and while I was at Hampton, I don’t think I ever missed one. I not only went to the weekly debate club, but I also helped start another one. I noticed that after dinner and before evening study, there were about twenty minutes when the guys just wasted time talking. So, about twenty of us made a club to use that time for debates or practicing public speaking. Not many people got as much happiness or benefit from twenty minutes as we did.

At the end of my second year at Hampton, with some money my mom and brother John sent me and a small gift from a teacher, I was able to go home to Malden, West Virginia for vacation. When I got there, the salt-furnaces weren’t working, and the coal mine wasn’t running because the miners were on strike. This strike usually happened whenever the miners had saved two or three months’ pay. During the strike, they spent all their savings and often went back to work in debt for the same pay or had to move to another mine, which cost a lot.
