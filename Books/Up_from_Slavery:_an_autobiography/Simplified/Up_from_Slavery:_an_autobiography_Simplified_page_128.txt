In the fall of 1878, after teaching school in Malden for two years and helping several young men and women, including my two brothers, get ready to go to the Hampton Institute, I decided to spend some months studying in Washington, D.C. I stayed there for eight months.

I learned a lot from my studies and met some strong, inspiring people. The school I went to didnâ€™t offer any industrial training, so I got to compare it with the Hampton Institute, which focused a lot on practical skills.

At this new school, most students had more money, dressed better, wore the latest styles, and some were even smarter. At Hampton, it was a strict rule that while the school helped pay some tuition, the students had to work to pay for their food, books, clothes, and housing, either fully by work or partly with work and partly with money.

At the school I was now attending, many students somehow had their personal expenses paid for them.
