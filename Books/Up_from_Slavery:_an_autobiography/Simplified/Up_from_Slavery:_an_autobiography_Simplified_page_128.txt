Inthefall of 1878, afterhaving taught school in Malden for two years, andafter I had succeeded in preparing several ofthe young men and women, besides my two brothers, to enter the Hampton Institute, I decidedto spend somemonths instudy at Washington, D.C. I remained there for eight months. I derived a great deal of benefit from thestudies which I pursued, and I came into contact with some strong men and women. At the institution I attended therewas no industrial traininggiven to the students, and I hadan opportunity ofcomparing the influence of an institutionwith no industrial trainingwith that of one like the Hampton Institute, that emphasized the industries. At this school I found the students,inmost cases, had more money, were better dressed, wore the latest style of all manner of clothing,and in some cases were more brilliant mentally. At Hampton itwas astanding rule that,whilethe institutionwould be responsible for securing some onetopaythe tuition forthestudents,themenandwomenthemselvesmust provide for their own board,books, clothing, and room wholly bywork, or partly bywork and partly in cash. At the institution at which I nowwas, I 88 UP FROM SLAVERY found that a large proportion of the students by some means had their personal expenses paid for them.
