As soon as the last good-bys were said, and the steamer had cut loose from the wharf, the load of care, anxiety, and responsibility which I had carried for eighteen years began to lift itself from my shoulders at the rate, it seemed to me, of a pound aminute. Itwas the first time in all those years that I had felt, even in a measure, free from care; and my feeling of relief itis hardtodescribe on paper. Addedto this was the delightful anticipation of being in Europe soon. It all seemed more like a dream than like a reality.
 
 Mr. Garrison had thoughtfully arranged to have us have one ofthe most comfortable rooms on the ship. The second or third day out I began to sleep, and I think that I slept at the rate offifteen hours a day during the remainder ofthe ten days' passage. Then itwas that I began to understand how tired I really was. These long sleeps I kept up for a month afterwe landed on the other side.
 
 Itwas such an unusual feeling towake up in the morning and realize that I had no engagements ; did not have to take a train at a certain hour; did not have an appointment to meet some one, or to make an address, at a certain hour. How different all this was from some ofthe experiences EUROPE 277 that I have been through when travelling,when I have sometimes slept in three different beds in asingle night!
