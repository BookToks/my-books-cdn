As soon as we said the last good-byes and the ship left the dock, I started to feel a huge weight lift off my shoulders. I had been carrying worry and responsibility for eighteen years, and it felt like that weight was disappearing bit by bit. It was the first time in all those years that I felt even a little bit free from stress. The relief I felt is hard to explain. 

On top of that, I was really excited about going to Europe soon. It all felt more like a dream than real life.

Mr. Garrison had kindly arranged for us to have one of the best rooms on the ship. After two or three days, I started to sleep a lot—like fifteen hours a day for the rest of the ten-day trip. That’s when I realized how tired I really was. I kept sleeping a lot for a whole month after we arrived.

It was such a strange feeling to wake up in the morning and know I didn’t have any plans. I didn’t have to catch a train, meet someone, or give a speech at a certain time. It was so different from some of my past trips when I sometimes slept in three different beds in one night!
