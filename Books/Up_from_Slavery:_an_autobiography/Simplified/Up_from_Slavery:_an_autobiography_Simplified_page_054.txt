When people ask me these days how I can still believe in a good future for my race in this country, even when things seem really bad, I remind them of the hard times we've already been through and how a higher power has helped us get through them.

Ever since I was old enough to think on my own, I have believed that, even though we were treated very badly, black people actually got almost as much out of slavery as white people did. The bad effects of slavery didnâ€™t only hurt black people. This was clear from life on our own plantation. The whole system of slavery made people think that working was a sign of being less important or weak. So, both black and white people on the plantation usually tried to avoid work.

The slave system on our plantation also took away the feeling of being independent and working hard from white people. My old master had many sons and daughters, but as far as I know, none of them ever learned a trade or a special skill to make a living.
