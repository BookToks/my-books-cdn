The more I meet rich people, the more I think they see their money as a tool that God gave them to do good things. Every time I visit Mr. John D. Rockefeller’s office, who has been very generous to Tuskegee, I am reminded of this. He always carefully checks to make sure every dollar he gives will help as much as possible—just like he’s investing in a business. This shows me that rich people are starting to think this way, and that’s really hopeful.

On the morning of June 24 at nine o’clock, I met President Eliot, the Board of Overseers of Harvard University, and other guests at the meeting spot on campus. We were there to be guided to Sanders Theatre for the graduation ceremony where degrees would be given out. Some of the people invited to get degrees were General Nelson A. Miles, Dr. Bell (who invented the telephone), Bishop Vincent, and Rev. Minot J. Savage.

We lined up right behind the President and the Board of Overseers. Soon after, the Governor of Massachusetts arrived, escorted by the Lancers, and stood next to President Eliot in the line for the march.
