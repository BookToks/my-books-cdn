The more we talked with the students, who were coming to us from different parts of the state, the more we realized that many of them wanted to get an education so they wouldn’t have to do hard manual work anymore.

There’s a story about a Black man in Alabama who, one hot day in July while working in a cotton field, stopped and looked up at the sky. He said, "Oh Lord, the cotton is so tough, the work is so hard, and the sun is so hot that I think I’m meant to be a preacher!"

About three months after the school opened, and when we were feeling very worried about our work, an old plantation near the town was put up for sale. It was about a mile from our school, Tuskegee. The big house there, which had been used by the owners during slavery, had been burned down.

After checking out the place carefully, we thought it was the perfect spot to make our school strong and lasting.
