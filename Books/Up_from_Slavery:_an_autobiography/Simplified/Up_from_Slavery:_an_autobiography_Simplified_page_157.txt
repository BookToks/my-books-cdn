When I was their guest, the family sat down to eat a meal, but I could tell it was a bit awkward and not how they usually did things. They were doing it to honor me.

Most mornings, the wife would put some meat in a frying pan and some dough in a skillet. They would cook these on the fire, and in about ten to fifteen minutes, breakfast was ready. Often, the husband would take his bread and meat and start walking to the field, eating as he went. The mother would sit in a corner and eat, maybe from a plate or straight from the pan. The kids would eat their bread and meat while running around the yard. When meat was hard to come by, the younger kids who couldn’t work in the fields usually didn’t get any meat.

After breakfast, without much cleaning up, the whole family would head to the cotton field. Every child big enough to carry a hoe would start working. The baby—there was usually at least one—would be laid down at the end of the cotton row so the mother could watch it when she finished working her part.
