I had already given up on false hopes and ideas, and I was ready to face the facts honestly. I wanted to do whatever I could to help save the next generation from a heavy burden. But I felt the weight of almost twenty years of hard thinking, reading, and watching things happen; the old problems were still there, and new ones had appeared.

Then I clearly saw that the way out of a hundred years of mistakes was shown by the man standing next to me, who was introducing me to the crowd. I looked at the materials he used. All around me was proof that he had found the natural path to follow. He had shown the way. Time, patience, encouragement, and hard work would finish the job.

At that moment, I understood better than ever how important Mr. Washington's work was for our country. This idea about his work and who he was has stayed with me ever since. It is because of this that we owe him thanks.

Teaching Black people to read, whether in English, Greek, or Hebrew, doesn’t solve the real problems. Making Black people work is what their masters did one way, and hunger did another; but both left Southern life just as it was. But teaching Black people to do skilled work—like people of all races who have succeeded—work that requires responsibility, education, and good character, and especially when Black people teach other Black people with a strong passion that beats all other charity efforts—this is what changes the whole economic foundation and character of a community.
