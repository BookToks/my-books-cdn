There were at least three hundred people at the party. Twice that evening, the Duchess came to talk to us. She asked me to write to her when we got home and tell her more about the work at Tuskegee. I did. At Christmas, we were happy and surprised to get her photo with her autograph. We kept writing back and forth, and now we think of the Duchess of Sutherland as one of our best friends.

After three months in Europe, we left from Southampton on the steamship St. Louis. This ship had a great library given by the people of St. Louis, Missouri. I found a book about Frederick Douglass and started reading it. I got interested in how he was treated on the ship during one of his visits to England. He said he wasnâ€™t allowed to go into the cabin and had to stay on the deck.

Just a few minutes after I finished reading, a group of ladies and gentlemen asked me to speak at a concert the next evening. And yet, some people still say that race problems in America are getting better!
