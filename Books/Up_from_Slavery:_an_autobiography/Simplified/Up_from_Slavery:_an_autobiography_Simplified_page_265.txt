Here is the speech I gave:

Mr. President, members of the Board of Directors, and everyone here,

One out of every three people in the South is Black. Any project that wants to help this area succeed in money, rights, or values can’t ignore this part of the population.

I want to tell you, Mr. President and Directors, what most Black people feel when I say that the leaders of this amazing Exposition have done a great job recognizing the worth and humanity of Black Americans at every step.

This recognition will help bring the two races closer together more than anything since we gained our freedom.

Also, this chance we have now will help us start a new time of growth in jobs and business.

At first, it’s normal that we tried to jump to the top right away instead of starting from the bottom.

It’s not surprising that, early on, people wanted to be in Congress or the state government more than owning land or learning a trade.

People liked political meetings and speeches more than starting farms or gardens.
