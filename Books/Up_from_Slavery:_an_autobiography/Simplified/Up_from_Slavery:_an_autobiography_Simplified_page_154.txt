EARLY DAYS AT TUSKEGEE

I remember one man, who seemed to be picked by the others to watch over my political future, came to me several times and said very seriously: "We want you to be sure to vote just like we do. We can't read the newspapers much, but we know how to vote, and we want you to vote just like we vote."

He also said, "We watch the white man, and we keep watching him until we find out how he's going to vote; and when we find out, then we vote exactly the opposite way. Then we know we’re right." 

But I’m happy to say that now, the habit of voting against the white man just because he is white is mostly going away. People are learning to vote based on what they think is right and what will help both races.

I got to Tuskegee, like I said, early in June 1881. The first month I spent finding a place for the school, traveling around Alabama, learning about the real lives of people, especially in the country areas, and getting the school known among the kind of people I wanted to come.

Most of my traveling was done on country roads, riding a mule and using a cart or a mule and buggy wagon to get around.
