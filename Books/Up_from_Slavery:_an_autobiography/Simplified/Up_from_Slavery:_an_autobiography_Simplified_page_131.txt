In a big group of people, many seemed to rely on the Government for everything. They didn’t have much drive to make a life for themselves and wanted government workers to create jobs for them. I often wished I could magically move most of these people to the countryside. There, they could work on the land, which is a strong and honest way to start. All successful nations and groups have begun this way, even if it’s slow and hard at first.

In Washington, I saw girls whose mothers made a living by doing laundry. These girls learned the job from their mothers, though not in a perfect way. Later, they went to public school for six or eight years. When they finished school, they wanted fancier dresses, hats, and shoes. Their wants grew, but their ability to earn money didn’t grow as much. Also, their years of schooling made them lose interest in their mothers’ work.
