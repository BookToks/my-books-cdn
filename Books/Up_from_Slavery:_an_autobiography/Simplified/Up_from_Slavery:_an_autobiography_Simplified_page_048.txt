The first shoes I remember wearing were wooden. They had rough leather on top, but the bottoms were about an inch thick and made of wood. When I walked, they made a loud noise. They were also really uncomfortable because they didn’t bend with my feet. Wearing them made me look very awkward.

But the worst thing I had to deal with as a slave boy was wearing a flax shirt. In the part of Virginia where I lived, slaves often wore clothes made from flax.

The flax used for our clothes was mostly the leftover, rough parts, which were the cheapest. I can’t think of anything worse, except maybe pulling a tooth, than putting on a new flax shirt for the first time. It felt like having a bunch of chestnut burrs or tiny pins poking my skin. Even now, I can clearly remember how painful it was to wear one of those shirts.

My skin was soft and tender, which made it hurt even more. But I had no choice. I had to wear the flax shirt or nothing at all. If I could choose, I would have picked to wear no clothes.
