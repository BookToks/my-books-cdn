But I want to say again that in many places in the South, the way people do ministry is getting better. I believe that in the next 20 or 30 years, most of the bad ones will be gone. There aren’t as many people wanting to be preachers now as before, and more people are choosing to work in industries. The teachers have improved even more than the ministers.

During the whole Reconstruction time, Black people in the South looked to the Federal Government for everything, kind of like how a kid looks to their mom. This was natural.

The government gave them freedom, and for more than 200 years, the whole country had gained from the work of Black people. Even when I was young and later as an adult, I felt it was really wrong that the government didn’t make sure there was good education for Black people along with what the states were doing. This would have helped prepare people better for being citizens.

It’s easy to complain and say what could have been done. But maybe, given all the problems, the people in charge did the best they could at the time.
