A ship was lost at sea for many days when it suddenly saw a friendly boat. From the mast of the unlucky ship came a signal, "Water, water; we are dying of thirst!" The friendly boat quickly replied, "Cast down your bucket where you are."

The lost ship sent the signal again, "Water, water; send us water!" and got the same answer, "Cast down your bucket where you are." They asked two more times, and each time the answer was, "Cast down your bucket where you are."

Finally, the captain of the lost ship listened and lowered his bucket. It came up full of fresh, clean water from the mouth of the Amazon River.

To my people, who want to improve their lives in a new place or donâ€™t see how important it is to have good relationships with the Southern white people nearby, I say: "Cast down your bucket where you are." Make friends in every honest way with all the people around you, no matter their race.

Cast down your bucket in farming, in working with machines, in business, in jobs at home, and in professional work.

Also, remember that no matter what problems the South has, when it comes to business, the South gives Black people a fair chance. This fair chance is shown clearly at this Exposition.
