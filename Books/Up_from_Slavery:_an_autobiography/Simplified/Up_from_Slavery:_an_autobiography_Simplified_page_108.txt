In both cases, I saw that the miners were worse off after a strike. Before strikes started in that part of the country, I knew miners who had a good amount of money saved. But once the professional labor leaders took over, even the careful savers began losing their money.

My mother and the rest of my family were very happy to see me and noticed how much I had improved during the two years I was away. People of all ages in the Black community, especially the older ones, were really glad I came back.

I had to visit every family and eat with them. At each place, I shared the story of my time at Hampton. I also spoke at church, Sunday school, and other places. But the one thing I was really looking for, work, I couldnâ€™t find.

There was no work because of the strike. I spent almost the whole first month of my vacation trying to find a job so I could earn money to pay for the trip back to Hampton and save some money to use when I got there.
