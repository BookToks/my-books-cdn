I said that I never had. She asked if I ever thought about going, and I told her no; it seemed like something I could never do.  

I forgot about the talk for a while, but a few days later I heard that some friends in Boston, including Mr. Francis J. Garrison, had collected enough money to pay for Mrs. Washington and me to take a trip to Europe for three or four months. They said we had to go.  

A year before, Mr. Garrison had tried to get me to promise to go to Europe for a summer vacation. He said he would get his friends to pay for the trip. Back then, the idea of going seemed so strange and impossible to me that I didnâ€™t take it seriously.  

But later, Mr. Garrison worked with the ladies I mentioned, and when they told me their plans, Mr. Garrison had already planned the route and even picked the ship we would take.  

The whole thing happened so fast and was so surprising that I was completely shocked.
