As soon as ourfirstbuildingwas near enough to completionsothatwe could occupy a portion of it —which was nearthe middle of the secondyear of the school—we opened a boarding department.
 
 Students had begun coming from quiteadistance, and in such increasing numbers thatwe felt more and more thatwe were merely skimming over the surface, inthatwewere notgettinghold of the students intheir home life.
 
 Wehad nothingbut the students andtheir appetites with which to begin a boarding department.
 
 No provision had been made in the new building for a kitchen and dining room; but wediscovered that bydigging out a large amount of earth from under the building we could make a partially lighted basement room that could be used for a kitchen and dining room. Again I called on the students to volunteer for work, this time to assist in digging out the basement. This they did, andin a fewweekswehadaplace tocookandeatin,although itwasveryrough anduncomfortable. Any one seeing the place nowwould never believe that itwas once usedfor adining room.
 
 The most serious problem, though, was to get 160 UP FROM SLAVERY the boarding department started off in running order, with nothing to do with in theway of furniture, and with no money with which to buy anything.
