As soon as our first building was almost finished—around the middle of the second year of the school—we started a boarding department.

Students had begun coming from far away, and more and more were coming each time. We felt like we were only scratching the surface because we didn’t really know much about the students’ home lives.

We only had the students and their hunger to start the boarding department.

The new building didn’t have a kitchen or dining room, but we found out that if we dug under the building, we could make a partly lit basement room to use for cooking and eating. I asked the students to help dig out the basement, and they did. After a few weeks, we had a place to cook and eat, even though it was rough and uncomfortable. Nobody would believe that the place was once used for dining.

The hardest problem was getting the boarding department up and running with no furniture and no money to buy anything.
