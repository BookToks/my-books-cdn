The official looked him over carefully, checking his hair, eyes, nose, and hands, but still looked confused. Finally, to figure it out, he bent down and looked at the man's feet. When I saw the conductor checking the man's feet, I thought, "This will decide it," and it did. The trainman quickly decided the passenger was Black and let him stay where he was. I felt happy that my race didn’t lose one of its members.

In my experience, you can tell who a real gentleman is by how he treats people from races that are less fortunate than his own. You can see this clearly by watching how the old-fashioned Southern gentlemen acted around their former slaves or their children.

One example is a story about George Washington. Once, he met a Black man on the road who politely tipped his hat. Washington tipped his hat back. Some white friends saw this and didn’t like it. When they criticized him, Washington said, "Do you think I’m going to let a poor, uneducated Black man be more polite than I am?"
