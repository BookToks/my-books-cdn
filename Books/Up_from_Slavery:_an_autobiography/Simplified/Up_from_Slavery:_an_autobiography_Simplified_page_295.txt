Each year during the last three years we have devoted some weeks to this work. The plan that we have followed has been for me to speak inthe morning to the ministers, teachers, and professional men. In the afternoon Mrs. Washingtonwouldspeak to thewomen alone, and in the evening I spoke to alarge mass-meeting. In almostevery casethe meetings have been attended not only by the coloured people in large numbers, but by the white people. In Chattanooga, Tenn., for example, there was present at themass-meetingan audience ofnotless than three thousand persons, and I was informed that eight hundred ofthese werewhite. I havedone no work that I really enjoyedmorethanthis, orthat I think has accomplished moregood.
 
 These meetings have given Mrs. Washington and myself an opportunity to get first-hand,accurate informationas tothe real conditionofthe race, by seeing the people intheir homes,theirchurches, their Sunday-schools, and their places ofwork, as well as in the prisons and dens of crime. These meetings also gave us an opportunity to see the relations that existbetween the races. I never feel so hopeful about the race as I do after being engaged in a series ofthesemeetings. I know that THE SUCCESS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING 249 a such occasions there is much that comes to the surface that is superficial and deceptive, but I have hadexperienceenough not to be deceivedby mere signs and fleeting enthusiasms.
