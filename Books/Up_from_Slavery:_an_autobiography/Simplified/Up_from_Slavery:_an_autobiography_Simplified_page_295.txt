For the past three years, we have spent a few weeks every year doing this work. The plan was for me to talk in the morning to ministers, teachers, and other professionals. In the afternoon, Mrs. Washington spoke only to women. Then in the evening, I spoke to a big crowd.

Almost every time, lots of Black people and also some white people came to the meetings. For example, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, about three thousand people came to the evening meeting, and I was told that eight hundred of them were white. I have enjoyed this work more than almost anything else, and I believe it has done a lot of good.

These meetings helped Mrs. Washington and me learn the real situation of our people by visiting their homes, churches, Sunday schools, workplaces, and even prisons and places where crime happens. We also got to see how Black and white people get along.

After doing these meetings, I always feel hopeful about our race. I know that sometimes things can seem better than they really are, but I have enough experience not to be fooled by just surface appearances or temporary excitement.
