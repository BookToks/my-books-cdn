About the flax shirt, my older brother John did something really kind for me. When I had to wear a new flax shirt, he would sometimes wear it first for a few days until it was softer and more comfortable. Back then, that one shirt was all I had to wear.

You might think that because most white people were away fighting a war to keep Black people as slaves, the slaves would hate them. But that wasnâ€™t true for the slaves on our farm, or for many others in the South where slaves were treated a little better.

During the Civil War, one of my young masters was killed, and two others got badly hurt. I remember how sad the slaves were when they heard about "Mars' Billy" dying. The sadness was real, not fake. Some slaves had cared for him when he was sick, and others had played with him as kids. "Mars' Billy" had even asked for mercy for slaves when they were being punished by the overseer or master.
