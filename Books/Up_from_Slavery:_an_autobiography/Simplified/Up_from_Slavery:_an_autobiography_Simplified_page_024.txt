INTRODUCTION xiii

I first noticed Mr. Washington’s personality from a simple event many years ago. I had never met him and didn’t know much about him except that he was the head of a school in Tuskegee, Alabama. I needed to write to him, so I called him "The Rev. Booker T. Washington" because I thought he was a preacher. 

When he answered, he didn’t say anything about me calling him a preacher. But the next time I wrote to him and called him a preacher again, he added a note at the end: "I have no claim to 'Rev.'" At that time, I knew many Black men who were leaders, but most were either politicians or preachers. I had never heard of the head of a big Black school who wasn’t a preacher. 

I thought to myself, "This is a new kind of man in the Black community—a man who sees his job as about economics, not religion." I wrote him a letter apologizing for thinking he was a preacher.

The first time I visited Tuskegee, I was asked to give a speech at the school on a Sunday evening. I sat on the stage in a big chapel and looked out at a thousand Black faces. Behind me, a choir of over a hundred sang a well-known religious song, and everyone joined in with deep feeling.
