Astohow much ofmytimeisspentin this way,the following clipping from a Buffalo (N.Y.) paper will tell. This has reference to an occasion when I spoke before the National Educational Association inthatcity.
 
 Booker T. Washington, the foremost educator among thecolouredpeople oftheworld,was averybusyman from the time he arrived in the citythe other night from the West and registered at the Iroquois. He had hardly removed the stains of travelwhen itwastimeto partake of supper. Thenhe held apublicleveein theparlours ofthe Iroquois until eight o'clock. During that time he was greeted by over two hundred eminent teachers and educators from all parts of the United States. Shortly after eight o'clock he was driven in a carriage to MusicHall, and inonehourand ahalf he madetwo ringing addresses, toas many as five thousand people, on Negro education.
 
 Then Mr. Washingtonwas taken in charge by a delegation ofcoloured citizens,headedbythe Rev. Mr. Watkins, and hustled off to a small informal reception,arranged in honour ofthe visitorbythepeople ofhis race.
 
 Nor can I,in additiontomaking these addresses, escape the duty ofcallingthe attention ofthe South and of the country ingeneral, through the medium ofthe press, to matters that pertain tothe interests 318 UP FROM SLAVERY ofboth races.
