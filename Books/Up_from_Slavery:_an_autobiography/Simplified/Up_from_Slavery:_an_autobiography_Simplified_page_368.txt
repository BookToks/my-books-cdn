This is how much time I spend doing this kind of work. The following news story from a Buffalo, New York paper shows what happened when I spoke at the National Educational Association in that city.

Booker T. Washington, the most important educator for Black people in the world, was very busy from the moment he arrived in the city the other night. He checked in at the Iroquois Hotel and barely had time to rest from his trip before it was time to eat dinner. After that, he held a public meeting in the hotel’s parlors until eight o’clock.

During that time, more than two hundred well-known teachers and educators from all over the United States came to see him. After eight, he was taken by carriage to Music Hall, where in just an hour and a half, he gave two powerful speeches about Black education to as many as five thousand people.

Then, Mr. Washington was welcomed by a group of Black citizens, led by Reverend Mr. Watkins. They quickly took him to a small, informal party held to honor him.

Besides giving these speeches, I also have to use the press to speak up for the interests of both Black and white people in the South and across the country.
