It was the perfect moment for him. The crowd, usually quiet like at a concert, was suddenly full of excitement they couldn’t hide. Many times, they stood up to cheer and shout together like one person. 

When this man, who was talented and powerful and had dark skin, started speaking and said the names Stearns and Andrew, feelings grew stronger. You could see soldiers and regular people with tears in their eyes. 

Then he turned to the Black soldiers on the stage, especially the flag-bearer from Fort Wagner. This soldier smiled and held the flag high even after being hurt. The speaker said, "To you, the tired and injured survivors of the Fifty-fourth, who came here today, your leader is not dead. Even if Boston made no statue and history didn’t tell your story, Robert Gould Shaw would have a monument that time couldn’t erase in you and your loyal people." 

That was the most emotional part of the day. Roger Wolcott, the Governor of Massachusetts and the people's representative, was the first to stand up and shout, "Three cheers to Booker T. Washington!" 

On the stage was Sergeant William H. Carney from New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was the brave Black soldier who carried the American flag at Fort Wagner. Even though many in his group were killed, he survived and said after the battle, "The old flag never touched the ground."
