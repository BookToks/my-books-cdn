When people in town heard we were planning to build a big new building, a white man from the South who ran a sawmill near Tuskegee came to me. He said he would gladly give us all the lumber we needed to build it, as long as I promised to pay him back once we got the money. I told him honestly that we didn’t have any money yet. Even so, he wanted to put the lumber on the site. After we got some money, we let him bring the lumber.

Miss Davidson started working again to collect small donations for the new building from both white and Black people nearby. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a group of people happier about anything than the Black people were about this new building.

One day, while we were having a meeting to raise money, an old Black man who had lived before the Civil War came all the way from twelve miles away. He brought a big hog in his ox-cart. During the meeting, he stood up and said he didn’t have any money to give, but he had raised two good hogs. He was giving one as his gift to help pay for the building.
