He makes a clear plan to help improve a specific family using the resources they already have. A smart student who does a project like this will learn more from it than from all the books about sociology and economics ever written.

I talked to a boy at Tuskegee who had done this kind of study, and I couldn’t stop comparing his knowledge and excitement to what I heard in a classroom at a Black university in a Southern city. That class was just repeating a hard economics lesson from a textbook by memory, without really understanding it, which felt like a waste of time.

Years ago, I asked Mr. Washington what he thought was the most important result of his work. He said, "I don’t know which to put first, the effect of Tuskegee’s work on Black people, or the effect on how white people see Black people." The gap between races was growing bigger because of bad education. But because of the ideas from Hampton and Tuskegee, the races are starting to understand each other better and are building a respectful and helpful relationship.
