From the time that I can rememberhaving any thoughts about anything, I recallthat I had an intenselonging to learn to read. I determined, when quite a small child, that, if I accomplished nothing else in life, I would insomewayget enough educationto enable me to read commonbooks and newspapers. Soon after wegot settled in some manner in our newcabin in WestVirginia, I induced my mother to get hold ofa book for me. How or.
 
 where she got it I do not know,but in someway sheprocured anold copy ofWebster's "blue-back " spelling-book,which containedthealphabet,followed by such meaningless words as "ab," "ba," "ca," "da." I beganat once todevour this book, and I think that it was the first one I ever had in my hands. I had learnedfrom somebody that the way tobegintoreadwas to learn the alphabet, so I tried in all the ways I could think ofto learn it,â€”all of course without a teacher, for I could find no one to teachme. Atthattimetherewas not asingle memberof myrace anywhere nearuswho could read, 28 UP FROM SLAVERY and I was too timid to approach any of the white people.
