From as far back as I can remember, I really wanted to learn how to read. When I was a little kid, I decided that even if I didn’t do anything else in life, I would somehow get enough education to read books and newspapers.

After we settled in our new cabin in West Virginia, I convinced my mom to get me a book. I don’t know how or where she found it, but she got an old copy of Webster’s “blue-back” spelling book. It had the alphabet and some simple words like “ab,” “ba,” “ca,” and “da.” I started reading it right away, and I think it was the first book I ever held.

I had learned from someone that the way to start reading was to learn the alphabet. So, I tried all kinds of ways to learn it by myself since I couldn’t find anyone to teach me. At that time, there wasn’t a single person of my race nearby who could read, and I was too shy to ask any white people for help.
