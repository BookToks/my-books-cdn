I could relate to many stories like this. Two ladies from Boston gave four hundred dollars. Two years later, when Tuskegee had grown a lot and we really needed money because the future looked uncertain and tough, the same two ladies sent us six thousand dollars. We were so surprised and encouraged by their gift. I should also say that for fourteen years, these friends have sent us six thousand dollars every year.

As soon as the plans for the new building were ready, the students started digging where the foundation would go after their regular classes. At first, they still thought it wasnâ€™t really right for them to do manual work because, as one student said, they were there "to be educated, not to work." But slowly, I saw that they were starting to believe that working was a good thing. After a few weeks of hard work, the foundation was ready, and a day was set to lay the corner-stone.

This corner-stone laying happened in the South, in the "Black Belt," the part of the country that had been most into slavery. Slavery had only ended about sixteen years before. Sixteen years earlier, no Black person could be taught from books without the teacher getting in trouble with the law or the community. Thinking about all this, what happened that spring day at Tuskegee was really amazing.
