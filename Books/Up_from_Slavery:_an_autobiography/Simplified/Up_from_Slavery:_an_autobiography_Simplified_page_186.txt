I could relatemanyinstancesofalmostthe same character. This fourhundreddollarswasgivenby two ladies inBoston. Two years later,when the work atTuskegee had grown considerably, andwhenwe were in the midst of a season when we were so much in need of money that the future looked doubtful and gloomy, the same two Boston ladies sent us six thousand dollars.
