When she couldn’t find a single bit of dirt on the floor or any dust on the furniture, she quietly said, "I guess you’re good enough to enter this school." I was one of the happiest people in the world. Cleaning that room was like my college test, and no one ever felt happier passing a test for Harvard or Yale than I did passing this one. I have taken many tests since then, but I still think this was the best one I ever passed.

I have talked about my own experience getting into the Hampton Institute. Maybe not many people had the exact same experience as me, but around that time, hundreds of young men and women faced similar problems and still made it to Hampton and other schools. They were determined to get an education no matter what.

The way I cleaned the classroom helped me get through Hampton. Miss Mary F. Mackie, the head teacher, gave me a job as a janitor. Of course, I was happy to take it because it helped me pay most of the cost for my room and board.
