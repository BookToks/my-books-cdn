This made me feel a lot better. Early the next morning, the customer showed up. After checking the coat carefully, he asked me how much I wanted for it. I told him I thought it was worth three dollars. He seemed to agree but said, "I'll do this: Iâ€™ll take the coat and pay you five cents now, and the rest of the money as soon as I can." You can probably guess how I felt then.

Because of this, I stopped hoping I could leave Hampton for my vacation work. I really wanted to go somewhere I could find a job that paid enough to buy some clothes and other things I needed. After a few days, almost all the students and teachers left for home, which made me feel even sadder.

After trying for several days in and around Hampton, I finally got a job at a restaurant in Fortress Monroe. The pay was just a little more than what I spent on food and lodging. At night and between meals, I had a lot of free time to study and read. I used this time to improve myself a lot during the summer.
