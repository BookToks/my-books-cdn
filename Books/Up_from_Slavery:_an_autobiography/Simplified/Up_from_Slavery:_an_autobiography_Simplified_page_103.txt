This cheered my drooping spiritsconsiderably. Earlythe nextmorning my prospective customer appeared. After looking the garment over carefully,he asked me how much I wanted forit. Itold him I thought it was worth three dollars. He seemed to agree with me as to price, but remarked in the most matter-of-fact way : " I tell you what I will do; I will take the coat, and I willpay you five cents, cash down, and payyou the rest ofthe moneyjust as soon as I can get it." It is not hard to imaginewhat my feelings were at the time.
 
 With this disappointment I gave up all hope of getting out of the town of Hampton for my vacationwork. I wanted very much to go where I might secure work that would at least pay me enough to purchase some much-needed clothing and other necessities. In afewdays practically all the students and teachers had left for their homes, and this served to depress my spirits even more.
 
 After trying for several days in and near the town of Hampton, I finally secured work in a restaurant at Fortress Monroe. The wages, however, were very little morethanmy board. Atnight, and between meals, I found considerable time for study HELPING OTHERS 65 and reading; and in this direction I improved myself very muchduring the summer.
