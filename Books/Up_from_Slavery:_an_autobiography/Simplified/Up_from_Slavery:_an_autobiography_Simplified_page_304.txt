The average crank has a long, messy beard, a thin face, and wears a black coat. The front of his vest and coat are covered in grease, and his pants are baggy at the knees.

In Chicago, after I spoke at a meeting, I met one of these guys. They usually have some plan to fix all the world’s problems at once.

This Chicago guy had a special method to keep Indian corn fresh for three or four years. He was sure that if all the Black people in the South used his method, it would solve the race problem. It didn’t matter that I told him the real problem was teaching Black people how to grow enough corn to last one year. Another Chicago crank wanted me to help him shut down all the national banks. He believed that would help Black people get ahead.

There are almost endless people ready to waste your time with no good reason.

Once, I spoke to a big crowd in Boston at night. The next morning, I was woken up when someone brought a card to my room with a message saying someone really wanted to see me. I thought it must be something important.
