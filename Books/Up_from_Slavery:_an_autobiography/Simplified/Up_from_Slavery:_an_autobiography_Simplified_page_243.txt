CHAPTER XIII TWO THOUSAND MILES FOR A FIVE-MINUTE SPEECH

Soon after we started our boarding department, many students who seemed really deserving but were very poor applied to join. These students, both boys and girls, didnâ€™t have enough money to pay even the small fees at the school.

It was hard to say no to them, so in 1884 we set up a night school to help some of these students.

The night school was organized like one I helped start at Hampton. At first, about a dozen students joined. They could only come if they had no money to pay for the regular day school.

These students had to work for ten hours during the day at a job or trade. Then, they studied academic subjects for two hours at night. This was the rule for the first year or two they were there.

They were paid a little more than what their board cost. Most of their earnings, except a small part, were kept by the school. This money was saved to help pay for their board when they moved to the regular day school later.
