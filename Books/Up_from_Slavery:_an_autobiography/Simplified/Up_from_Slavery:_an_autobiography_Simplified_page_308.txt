People often ask me how I find time to rest or have fun when I have so much work, especially work in front of others. They also want to know what kind of sports or hobbies I like. This is a hard question to answer.

I believe everyone should take care of their body and mind. It’s important to stay healthy and strong, with steady nerves, so you’re ready for big challenges and tough times.

I try to plan each day’s work carefully. I don’t just do the same boring tasks over and over. I finish the routine stuff early, then start new or important work. Every day, before leaving my office, I clear my desk of letters and notes. This way, I can start fresh the next day.

I also make sure my work doesn’t control me. Instead, I stay in charge and keep ahead of it. Being the boss of your own work feels really good and motivates you.

From my experience, if you follow this plan, work can actually make you feel fresh and strong in both body and mind. This helps keep you healthy and ready for anything.
