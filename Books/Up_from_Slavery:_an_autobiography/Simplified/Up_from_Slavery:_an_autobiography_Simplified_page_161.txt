CHAPTER VIII TEACHING SCHOOL IN A STABLE AND A HEN-HOUSE

I admit that what I saw during my month of traveling and learning made me feel very sad. The work needed to help these people seemed almost impossible. I was just one person, and it felt like the small effort I could make wouldn’t do much to change things. I wondered if I could really do anything and if it was even worth trying.

After spending this month seeing the real life of the Black people, I became more sure than ever that helping them would need more than just copying the way schools in New England were run. I understood better why General Armstrong’s school at Hampton was a smart idea. Giving the children I met only a few hours of book learning each day would almost be a waste of time.

After talking with the people in Tuskegee, I decided that the school would open on July 4, 1881, in a small, simple building and church that we had found for the school.
