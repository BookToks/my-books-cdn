CHAPTER VIII TEACHING SCHOOL IN A STABLE AND A HEN-HOUSE I CONFESSthatwhat I sawduring mymonth of travel and investigationleft me with avery heavy heart. Thework tobedone in orderto lift these people up seemed almost beyond accomplishing. I was only oneperson,and it seemed to me that the little effort which I could put forth could go such a short distance toward bringing about results. I wondered if I could accomplish anything, and ifit were worth while for me to try.
 
 Ofone thing I feltmore strongly convinced than ever, after spending this month inseeing the actual life of the coloured people, and that was that, in order to lift them up, something must be done more than merely to imitate New England education as it then existed. I saw more clearly than ever the wisdom of the system which General Armstrong had inaugurated at Hampton. To take the children of such people as I had been among for a month, and each day give them a few hours of mere book education, I felt would be almost a wasteoftime.
