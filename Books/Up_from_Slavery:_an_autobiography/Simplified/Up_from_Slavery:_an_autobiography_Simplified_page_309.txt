I believe that when someone loves their work, it gives them a special kind of strength that is really important.

When I start work in the morning, I hope to have a good and successful day. But I also get ready for tough and unexpected problems. I prepare myself in case I hear that one of our school buildings is on fire, or has burned down, or if some bad accident happened. I also get ready in case someone says mean things about me in public or in writing, maybe for something I did or didn’t do, or for something they think I said—even things I never actually said.

In nineteen years of working without stopping, I have only taken one vacation. That was two years ago when some friends gave me money so Mrs. Washington and I could spend three months in Europe. I believe everyone should keep their body in good shape. I try to take care of small health problems, thinking that if I do, bigger problems won’t come. When I can’t sleep well, I know something is wrong. If any part of my body feels weak or isn’t working right, I go see a good doctor.
