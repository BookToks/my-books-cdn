Even though I was really disappointed, I decided I would still learn something. I worked harder than ever to understand what was in the "blue-back" speller.

My mom felt sorry for me because I was upset. She tried to comfort me and help me find a way to learn.

After some time, I arranged with my teacher to have lessons at night after work. I liked these night lessons so much that I think I learned more at night than the other kids did during the day. My experience with night school made me believe in the idea of night school, which I later worked with at Hampton and Tuskegee. But I still really wanted to go to day school, and I kept asking for a chance. Finally, I got permission to go to day school for a few months. The deal was I had to get up early, work at the furnace until nine oâ€™clock, then go to school, and after school, go back to work for at least two more hours.

The school was far from the furnace, and since I had to work until nine and school started at nine, I found myself in a tough spot.
