But, cfcourse, when I saw how all the other boys were dressed, I began to feel quite uncomfortable. As usual, I put the case before my mother, and she explained to me that she had no moneywith which to buy a "store hat," which was a rather new institution at that time among the members of my race and was considered quite the thing for young and old to own, but that she would find away to help me out of the difficulty. She accordingly got two pieces of "homespun" (jeans) and sewed them together, and I was soon the proud possessor of my first cap.
 
 The lesson that mymother taught me inthis has always remained with me, and I have tried as best I could to teach it to others. I have always felt proud, whenever I think of the incident, that my mother had strength of character enough not to be led intothe temptation of seeming to be that which she was notâ€”of trying to impress my schoolmates and others with the fact that she was able to buy me a"store hat" when shewas not. I have always felt proud that she refused to go into debt for that which she did not have the money to pay for.
 
 Since that time I have owned many kinds ofcaps and hats,but never one of which I have felt so UP FROM SLAVERY 34 proud as ofthe cap madeofthe two pieces ofcloth sewed together by my mother.
