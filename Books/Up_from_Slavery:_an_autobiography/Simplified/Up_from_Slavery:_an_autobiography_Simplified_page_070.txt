But, of course, when I saw how all the other boys were dressed, I started to feel really uncomfortable. Like always, I told my mom about it, and she explained that she didn’t have money to buy a "store hat." Back then, a store hat was something new and popular for people in my community, and lots of kids and adults wanted one. But she promised she would find a way to help me.

So, she took two pieces of homemade cloth (jeans) and sewed them together. Soon, I had my very first cap, and I was really proud of it.

The lesson my mom taught me here has stayed with me forever, and I’ve tried to share it with others. I’ve always felt proud when I think about how strong she was—not pretending to be someone she wasn’t. She didn’t try to impress my school friends by buying something she couldn’t afford. She also didn’t go into debt just to get me a hat.

Since then, I’ve had many kinds of caps and hats, but none have made me as proud as the one my mom made by sewing those two pieces of cloth together.
