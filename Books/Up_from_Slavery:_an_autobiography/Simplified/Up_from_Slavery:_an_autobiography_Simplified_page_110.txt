Sometimes we had food cooked for us, and sometimes we didn’t. I remember that more than once, a can of tomatoes and some crackers were all we had for a meal. Our clothes weren’t taken care of, and everything in our home became really messy and broken. I think this was the saddest time of my life.

My good friend Mrs. Ruffner, who I mentioned before, always welcomed me into her home and helped me in many ways during this hard time. Before the vacation ended, she gave me some work. This, along with a job in a coal mine far from my home, helped me earn a little money.

At one point, it seemed like I might have to give up on going back to Hampton, but I really wanted to return. I decided I wouldn’t give up without trying hard. I was very eager to get some clothes for winter, but I was disappointed, except for a few pieces my brother John got for me. Even though I needed money and clothes, I was happy because I had saved enough money to pay for my trip back to Hampton.
