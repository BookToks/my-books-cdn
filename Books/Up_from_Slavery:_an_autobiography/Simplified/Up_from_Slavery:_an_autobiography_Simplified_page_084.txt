The distance from Malden to Hampton is about five hundred miles. I had not been away from home many hours before I realized that I did not have enough money to pay my fare to Hampton.

One experience I will always remember happened in the afternoon. I had been traveling over the mountains in an old stagecoach. Late in the evening, the coach stopped for the night at a plain, unpainted building called a hotel. All the other passengers, except me, were white. Because I didnâ€™t know better, I thought the hotel was there for all the passengers on the stagecoach.

I had not thought about how the color of my skin would change things. After all, the other passengers were shown their rooms and were getting ready for supper. I nervously went up to the man at the desk. I had almost no money to pay for food or a bed, but I hoped I could ask the landlord to let me stay because it was cold in the mountains of Virginia that time of year.

Without even asking if I had money, the man at the desk firmly said no. He refused to think about giving me food or a place to sleep. This was my first time learning what the color of my skin really meant.
