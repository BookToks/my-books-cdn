I had planned to leave this money for your school in my will, but I thought it was better to give it to you while I am still alive. I remember happily when you visited me two years ago.  

I can hardly think of anything that would have made me happier than getting this check. It was the biggest single gift the school had ever gotten up to that time. It came when we hadn’t received any money for a long time. We were really struggling because we didn’t have enough funds, and the stress was huge. It’s hard to imagine anything more stressful than running a big organization with lots of bills to pay, not knowing where the money will come from each month.  

For me, the worry was even bigger. If the school had been run by white people and failed, it would have hurt education for Black people. But since our school was run by Black people, if it failed, it wouldn’t just mean losing the school. It would also make many people stop believing in the abilities of the whole race.  

Getting this check for ten thousand dollars helped lift a heavy weight off my shoulders that had been pressing down on me for days.
