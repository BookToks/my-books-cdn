He arrived at the school around nine oâ€™clock at night. Someone had the idea to give the General a special welcome with "pine-knot torchlight." This plan was done, and as soon as his carriage entered the school grounds, he passed between two lines of glowing pine knots held by more than a thousand students and teachers waving them.

The whole thing was so new and surprising that the General felt very happy. He stayed as a guest in my home for almost two months. Even though he could hardly use his voice or move his body, he spent almost all his time thinking of ways to help the South.

Many times during his visit, he told me that the country should help not only the Black people in the South but also the poor white people. At the end of his visit, I promised again to work harder than ever for the cause that was so important to him. I said that if a man in his condition was willing to think, work, and act, then I should do everything I could to support what he cared about.
