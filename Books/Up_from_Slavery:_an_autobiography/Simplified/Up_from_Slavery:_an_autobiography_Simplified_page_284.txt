I believe that someday, because of smart thinking and good relationships between races, cheating in elections in the South will stop. People will realize that when a white person cheats a Black person out of their vote, they soon start cheating other white people too. This kind of dishonesty usually ends with stealing or other serious crimes.

I think the South will eventually want all its citizens to vote. It will understand that having a healthy and active community is better than having political problems caused when half the people donâ€™t take part or care about the government.

Usually, I support free voting rights for everyone. But in the South, there are special problems that might need some protection for voting for now, like tests about education or property. However, any tests used should be fair and apply equally to both races.
