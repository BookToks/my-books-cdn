The war finally ended, and the day of freedom arrived. It was a big and exciting day for everyone on our plantation. We had been waiting for it. Freedom had been in the air for months. Soldiers who ran away were coming back home every day. Others who had finished their service or were released were passing by our place all the time.

The "grapevine telegraph" was busy all day and night. News and talks about big events spread quickly from one plantation to another.

Because of fear of "Yankee" soldiers coming, the silverware and other valuable things were taken from the big house, buried in the woods, and watched over by trusted slaves. Anyone who tried to mess with the buried treasure would be in big trouble.

The slaves gave the Yankee soldiers food, drink, and clothesâ€”anything except what they were told to protect. As the big day got closer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. The songs were louder, stronger, and went on later into the night.

Most of the songs talked about freedom. They had sung these songs before, but they always said that the "freedom" meant going to the next world, not life in this world.
