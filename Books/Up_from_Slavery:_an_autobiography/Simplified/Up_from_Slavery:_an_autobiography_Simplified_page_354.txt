He said many times that he wanted to show he cared about and believed in the race, not just by talking but by his actions. When I told him that it would mean a lot to the race if the President was willing to travel 140 miles out of his way to spend a day at a Black school, he was very impressed.

While I was with the President, a white man from Atlanta, who was a Democrat and had once owned slaves, came into the room. The President asked him if it was a good idea to go to Tuskegee. Without any doubt, the man said it was the right thing to do. This was supported by Dr. J. L. M. Curry, a friend of the race.

The President promised he would visit our school on December 16.

When people found out the President was coming to our school, the white citizens of Tuskegee, a town about a mile from the school, were just as happy as our students and teachers. The white men and women in the town started planning to decorate and make committees to work with our school leaders so the important visitor would have a great welcome.
