In some nearby counties, there were about six Black people for every one white person.

People often ask me what "Black Belt" means. From what I know, the term was first used to describe an area with dark, rich soil. This part of the South had the best soil, so slaves were brought there in large numbers because they were most useful on the farms. After the war, the term started to mean the counties where Black people were the majority.

Before I went to Tuskegee, I thought there would be a building and all the tools I needed to start teaching. But I was disappointed to find nothing like that. What I did find was something more important than buildings or toolsâ€”hundreds of eager students who really wanted to learn.

Tuskegee seemed like a perfect place for the school.

It was right in the middle of the biggest Black population and was pretty quiet, located five miles from the main railroad line, connected by a short track.
