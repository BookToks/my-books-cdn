Our biggest problem is that as we move from being slaves to being free, we might forget that most of us will have to live by the work we do with our hands. We need to remember that we will succeed as much as we learn to respect and value regular work and use our brains and skills in everyday jobs. We will do well if we can tell the difference between what is just for show and what is really useful.

No group of people can do well until it understands that working in a field is just as important as writing a poem. We have to start at the bottom of life, not at the top. We also shouldn’t let our problems stop us from seeing our chances to do better.

To the white people who hope that new immigrants with different languages and habits will help the South grow, if I could speak to you, I would say the same thing I say to my own people: “Look around you and trust the people who are already here.” Look to the eight million Black people whose habits you know, whose loyalty and love you have seen in hard times when being disloyal would have destroyed your homes.
