The girls were not taught how to cook, sew, or take care of the house. All of these jobs were done by the slaves. The slaves didn’t really care about the plantation, and because they didn’t know much, they couldn’t do these tasks very well.

Because of this, fences were broken, gates hung off their hinges, doors creaked, windows were missing glass, plaster had fallen off but wasn’t fixed, and weeds grew in the yard. Usually, there was enough food for both white people and black slaves, but inside the house and on the dining table, there was no special care or style to make the home comfortable or attractive. Also, a lot of food and materials were wasted, which was sad. When freedom came, the slaves were almost as ready to start a new life as the masters, except they didn’t have much education or property.

The slave owners and their sons didn’t learn any special skills. They believed, without thinking, that doing manual work was not for them. On the other hand, many slaves had learned certain skills, and none of them were ashamed or unwilling to work.
