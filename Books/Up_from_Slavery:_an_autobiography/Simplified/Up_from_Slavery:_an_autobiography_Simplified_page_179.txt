We have done well enough that I feel sure the season now means something new, not only here but also wherever our graduates have gone.

Right now, one of the best things about Christmas and Thanksgiving at Tuskegee is how our graduates and students spend their time helping others, especially those who are struggling. Not long ago, some young men spent a holiday fixing a cabin for a helpless Black woman who is about seventy-five years old. Another time, I told people in chapel that a poor student needed a coat because he was cold. The next morning, two coats showed up at my office for him.

I have also talked about how the white people in Tuskegee and nearby want to help the school. From the start, I decided to make the school a real part of the community where it is located. I didn’t want anyone to feel like it was a strange place dropped into their town, something they didn’t care about or feel responsible for.
