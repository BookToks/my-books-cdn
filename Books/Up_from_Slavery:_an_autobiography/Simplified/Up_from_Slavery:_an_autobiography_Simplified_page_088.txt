If the people who gave the money to build that place could see how much it meant to me and to thousands of other young people, they would feel even happier about giving. To me, it looked like the biggest and most beautiful building I had ever seen. Seeing it made me feel alive. I felt like a new life was starting—that life now had a new meaning. It felt like I had reached a special place, and I promised myself that nothing would stop me from trying my best to become someone who could do a lot of good in the world.

As soon as I got to the Hampton Institute, I went to the head teacher to ask to join a class.

Since I hadn’t had good food, a bath, or clean clothes for a long time, I didn’t make a very good first impression. I could tell she wasn’t sure if it was a good idea to let me be a student. I could understand why she might think I was lazy or homeless. For a while, she didn’t say yes or no, so I stayed around and did everything I could to show her I was serious and worthy.
