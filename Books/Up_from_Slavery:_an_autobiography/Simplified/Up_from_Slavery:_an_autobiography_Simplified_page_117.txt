Myday and night school workwas notallthat I undertook. I established a smallreading-roomand a debating society. On Sundays I taught two Sunday-schools, one inthe town of Malden in the afternoon, and the other in the morning at a place three miles distant from Malden. In addition to this, I gave private lessons to several young men whom I was fitting to send to the Hampton Institute. Withoutregard to payandwithlittlethought of it, I taught any one who wanted to learn anything that I could teach him. I was supremely happy in the opportunity of being able to assist somebody else. I did receive, however, a small salaryfromthe public fund,formywork as apublicschool teacher.
 
 Duringthe time that Iwas astudentatHampton myolder brother,John, not onlyassisted meall that hecould,butworkedallofthetimeinthecoal-mines in order to support the family. He willingly neglected his own education that he might help me.
 
 Itwas my earnest wish to help him to prepare to enter Hampton, andtosavemoney to assist him in his expenses there. Both of these objects I was successful in accomplishing. In three years my HELPING OTHERS 77 brother finished the course at Hampton, and he is now holding theimportantposition of Superintendentof Industries atTuskegee.
