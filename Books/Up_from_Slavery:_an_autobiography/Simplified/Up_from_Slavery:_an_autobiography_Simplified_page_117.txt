I did more than just school work during the day and night. I started a small reading room and a debate club. On Sundays, I taught two Sunday schools—one in Malden in the afternoon, and another three miles away in the morning. I also gave private lessons to some young men I was helping get ready to go to the Hampton Institute. I didn’t care about getting paid; I taught anyone who wanted to learn what I could teach. I was really happy to help others. I did get a small salary from public funds for my work as a public school teacher.

While I was a student at Hampton, my older brother John helped me as much as he could. He worked all the time in the coal mines to support our family. He gave up his own education so he could help me.

I really wanted to help him get ready to go to Hampton and save money for his expenses there. I was able to do both. In three years, my brother finished the course at Hampton, and now he has an important job as Superintendent of Industries at Tuskegee.
