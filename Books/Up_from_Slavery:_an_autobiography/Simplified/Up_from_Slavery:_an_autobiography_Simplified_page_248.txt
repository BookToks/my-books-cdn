I learned early on that it’s hard to change someone by insulting them. It’s better to notice and praise the good things they do than just point out the bad.

While following this idea, I have not been afraid to clearly talk about the mistakes made by some parts of the South. I found that many people in the South respond well to honest and direct criticism when it’s fair. Usually, if you need to criticize the South, it’s better to do it there, not in Boston. For example, a man from Boston who comes to Alabama to criticize Boston wouldn’t help as much as someone who speaks honestly about Alabama in Boston.

In my speech at Madison, I said that the best way to handle relations between races is to bring people together by honest and respectful means, not by causing more anger. I also said that when it comes to voting, Black people should think more about what’s good for their own community instead of trying only to please someone who lives far away and doesn’t share their concerns.
