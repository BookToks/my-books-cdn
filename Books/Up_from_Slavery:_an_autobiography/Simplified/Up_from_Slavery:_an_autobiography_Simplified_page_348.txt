Seeing over a thousand strong men, who represent the best in the State, Church, business, and education, all full of college loyalty and pride—especially the kind that feels very Harvard—is an experience I won't forget easily.

After dinner, some of the speakers were President Eliot, Governor Roger Wolcott, General Miles, Dr. Minot J. Savage, the Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge, and me. When it was my turn to speak, I said this: It would help me feel less nervous if I could believe I deserve the great honor you are giving me today. 

You have called me from the Black Belt in the South, from among my humble people, to share this special moment. I don’t know why, but I think one important question in America is how to connect the rich, strong, and educated with the poorest and least educated people. At the same time, we need to appreciate how both groups can make each other stronger. 

How can the people living in big houses on Beacon Street understand the needs of those living in the smallest cabins in Alabama’s cotton fields or Louisiana’s sugar lands? Harvard University is helping solve this problem, not by lowering its own standards, but by helping raise up the masses.

If my life has meant anything in helping my people rise up and improving the relationship between your race and mine, I promise from today on it will mean even more.
