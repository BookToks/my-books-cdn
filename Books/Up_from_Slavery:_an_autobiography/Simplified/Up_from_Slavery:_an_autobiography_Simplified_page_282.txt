Actually, there are signs that this change is already starting, even if just a little bit.

Let me explain. Imagine that a few months before the Atlanta Exposition, people from outside the South had asked for a Black person to be included in the opening program and on the award jury. Do you think that would have happened? I don’t think so. The Atlanta leaders only did what they did because they wanted to recognize real talent in the Black community. No matter what we say, there is something in human nature that makes people notice and respect talent in others, no matter their color or race.

I believe it’s important for Black people—like most already are—to act calmly when asking for political rights. They should rely on gaining respect through owning property, being smart, and having good character. I think getting full political rights will happen naturally and slowly, not suddenly or quickly like magic.
