In the midst of all the difficulties which I encountered in getting the little school started, and since then through a period of nineteenyears, there are two men among all the many friends of the school in Tuskegee upon whom I have depended constantly for advice and guidance; and the success of the undertaking is largely due to these men, from whom I have never sought anything in vain.
 
 I mention themsimplyastypes. Oneis awhiteman and an ex-slaveholder, Mr. George W. Campbell; the other is a black man and an ex-slave, Mr. Lewis Adams. Thesewere the menwhowrote to General Armstrong for a teacher.
 
 Mr. Campbell is a merchant and banker, and had had little experience indealing with matters pertaining to education. Mr. Adams was a mechanic, and had learned the trades ofshoemaking, harnessmaking, and tinsmithing during thedays ofslavery.
 
 He had never been to school a day in his life, but in some way he had learned to read andwrite while aslave. From the first,these two men saw clearly what my plan of educationwas, sympathized with me, and supportedme in every effort. Inthedays which were darkest financially for the school, Mr.
 
 Campbell was never appealed to when he was not TEACHING SCHOOL 121 willing to extend all the aidin hispower.
