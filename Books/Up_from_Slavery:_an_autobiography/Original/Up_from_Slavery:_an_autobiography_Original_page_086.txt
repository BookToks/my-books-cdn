THE STRUGGLE FOR AN EDUCATION 49 I must have walked the streets till after midnight. At last I became so exhausted that I could walk no longer. I was tired, I was hungry, I was everything but discouraged. Just about the time when I reached extreme physical exhaustion, I came upon a portion ofa street where the board sidewalk was considerably elevated. I waited for a fewminutes, till I was sure that no passers-by could see me, and then creptunder the sidewalk and lay for the night upon the ground, with my satchel of clothing for a pillow. Nearly all night I could hear the tramp of feet over my head. The next morning I foundmyself somewhat refreshed, but I was extremelyhungry,because it had been a long time since I had had sufficient food. As soon as it became light enough for me to see my surroundings I noticed that I was near alargeship, and that this ship seemed to be unloading a cargo of pig iron. I went at once to the vessel and asked the captainto permitme to help unload the vessel in order to get money for food. The captain, a white man, who seemed to be kind-hearted, consented.
 
 I worked long enough to earn money for my breakfast, and it seems to me, as I remember it now, to have been about the best breakfast that I have ever eaten.
 
 My work pleased the captain sowellthat hetold 1 50 UP FROM SLAVERY me if I desired I could continue working for a small amount perday.
