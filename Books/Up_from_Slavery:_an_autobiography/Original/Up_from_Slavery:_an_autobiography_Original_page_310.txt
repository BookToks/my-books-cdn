The ability to sleep well, at any time and in any place, I find of greatadvantage. I have so trained myself that I can lie down for a nap of fifteen or twenty minutes, and get up refreshed in body and mind.
 
 I have said that I make it a rule tofinishup each day's work beforeleaving it. There is, perhaps, one exception to this. When I have an unusually difficultquestion to decide—one that appeals strongly to the emotions— I find it a safe rule to sleep over it for a night, or to wait until I have had an opportunity to talk it overwith my wife and friends.
 
 As to my reading; the mosttime I get for solid reading is when I am on the cars. Newspapers are to me a constant source ofdelight and recreation.
 
 The only trouble is that I read too many of them.
 
 Fiction I care little for. Frequently I have to almost force myself to read a novel that is on every one's lips. The kind of reading that I have the greatest fondness for is biography. I like to be sure that I am reading about a real man or a real thing. I think I do not go too far when I say that I have read nearly every book and magazine article that has been written aboutAbraham Lincoln. In literature he is mypatron saint.
 
 Out of the twelve months in a year I suppose 264 UP FROM SLAVERY that, on an average, I spend sixmonths away from Tuskegee.
