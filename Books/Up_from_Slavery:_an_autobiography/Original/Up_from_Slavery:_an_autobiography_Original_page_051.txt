I know of instances where the former masters of slaves have for years been suppliedwith money by their former slaves tokeep them from suffering. I have known ofstill other cases inwhich the former slaves have assistedinthe education ofthedescendants oftheir former owners. I know of a case on a large plantationin the South inwhich a young whiteman, the son oftheformer owneroftheestate, has become so reducedinpurse and self-control by 1 reason of drink that he is a pitiable creature; and yet, notwithstanding the poverty of the coloured people themselves on this plantation,they have for years supplied this young white man with the necessities of life. One sends him a little coffee or sugar, another a little meat, and so on. Nothing that the colouredpeople possess is too good for the son of " old Mars' Tom," who will perhaps never be permitted to suffer while any remain on the place who knew directly or indirectly of "old Mars' Tom." I have said that there are few instances of a member of my race betraying a specific trust.
 
 One of the best illustrations of this which I know ofis in the case of an ex-slave from Virginia A SLAVE AMONG SLAVES 15 whom I met not long ago in a little town in the state of Ohio.
