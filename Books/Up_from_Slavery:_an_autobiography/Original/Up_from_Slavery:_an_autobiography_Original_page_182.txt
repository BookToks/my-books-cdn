The first animal thatthe school came intopossession ofwas anold blind horse givenus by one ofthewhite citizens of Tuskegee. Perhaps I may add here that at the present time theschool owns overtwohundredhorses,colts, mules,cows, calves, andoxen, and about sevenhundred hogs and pigs, as well as alarge number ofsheep and goats.
 
 The school was constantly growing in numbers, so much so that, after we hadgotthe farm paid for, thecultivationofthelandbegun, andthe old cabins which we hadfoundontheplacesomewhatrepaired, we turned our attention toward providing a large, substantial building. After having given a good deal of thought to the subject, we finally had the plans drawn for a building that was estimated to costaboutsixthousanddollars. This seemed tous atremendous sum,butweknewthatthe school must gobackward or forward,and that our work would meanlittle unless wecouldget hold ofthe students in their home life.
 
 One incidentwhich occurred aboutthis timegave me agreat deal of satisfaction as well as surprise.
