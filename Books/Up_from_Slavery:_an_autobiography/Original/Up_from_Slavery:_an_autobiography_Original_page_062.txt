What little clothing and few household goods we had were placed in a cart, but the children walkedthe greater portion of thedistance, which was several hundred miles.
 
 I do not think any of us ever had been very far from the plantation,and the taking of alongjourney into another state was quite an event. The parting from our former owners and the members of our own race on the plantation was a serious occasion. From the time of our parting till their death we kept up a correspondencewith the older members of the family, and in later years we have kept in touch with those who were the younger members. We were several weeks making the trip, andmost of the timewe slept in the open air and did our cooking over a log fire out-of-doors. One night I recall that we camped near an abandoned log cabin, and my mother decided to build a fire in that for cooking, and afterward to make a "pallet" on the floor for our sleeping. Just as the fire had gottenwell starteda large black snake fully a yard and a half long dropped downthe chimney and ran out on the floor. Of course we at once abandoned that cabin. Finally we reached our destination -a little town called Malden, which is about five miles from Charleston, the present capital ofthe state.
