I believe thatin time, through the operation of intelligence and friendly race relations, all cheating at the ballotbox inthe South will cease. Itwill become apparent that the white manwho begins by cheating a Negro out ofhis ballot soon learns to cheat a white man out of his, and that the man who does this ends his career of dishonesty by the theft of property or by some equally serious crime. In my opinion, the time will come when the South will encourage all of its citizens to vote. It will see that it pays better, from every standpoint, to have healthy, vigorous life than to have that political stagnation which always results when one-half of the population has no share and no interest in the Government.
 
 As a rule, I believe in universal, free suffrage, but I believe that in the South we are confronted with peculiar conditions that justify the protection ofthe ballot in many ofthe states, for a while at least, either by an educational test, a property test, or by both combined; but whatever tests are required, they should be made to apply with equal and exactjusticeto both races.
