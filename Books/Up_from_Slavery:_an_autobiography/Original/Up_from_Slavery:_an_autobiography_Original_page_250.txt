I explained that mytheory ofeducation for the Negrowould not,forexample,confine him for all time to farm life—to the production of the best and the most sweet potatoes—but that, if he succeeded in this line ofindustry, he could lay the foundations uponwhichhis childrenandgrandchildren couldgrowto higher and more important things in life.
 
 Such, in brief, were someoftheviews I advocated in this first address dealing with the broad question ofthe relations ofthe two races,and since that time Ihave notfoundanyreason forchangingmy views onany importantpoint.
 
 In my early life Iused to cherish a feeling ofill will toward any one who spoke in bitter terms against the Negro, orwho advocated measures that tended to oppress the black man ortake from him opportunities for growth in the mostcomplete manner. Now, whenever I hear any one advocating measures that are meant to curtail the development ofanother, I pitytheindividual whowoulddothis.
 
 I know that the onewho makes this mistake does so because of his own lack of opportunity for the highest kind ofgrowth. I pityhimbecause I know 204 UP FROM SLAVERY that he is trying tostop the progress of theworld, and because I know that in time the development and the ceaseless advance of humanity will make him ashamed of his weak and narrow position.
