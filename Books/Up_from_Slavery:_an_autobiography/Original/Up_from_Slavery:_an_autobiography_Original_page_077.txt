With few exceptions, the Negro youth mustwork harder and must perform his tasks even better than a whiteyouth in order to secure recognition. But out of the hard and unusual struggle through which he is compelled to pass, he gets a strength, a confidence, that one misses whose pathway is comparatively smooth by reason of birth and race.
 
 From any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the Negro race,than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of any other race. I have always been made sad when I have heard members ofany race claiming rights and privileges, or certain badges ofdistinction, on the ground simply that theywere members of this or that race, regardless oftheir own individual worth or attainments. I have been made to feel sad for such persons because I am conscious of the fact that mere connection with what is known as a superior race will not permanently carry an individual forward unless he has individual worth, and mere connectionwithwhatis regarded as aninferior race will not finally hold an individual back if he possesses intrinsic, individual merit. Every persecuted individual and race shouldget much consolation out of the great human law, which is universal BOYHOOD DAYS 41 and eternal, that merit,no matter underwhat skin found, is, in the long run,recognized and rewarded.
