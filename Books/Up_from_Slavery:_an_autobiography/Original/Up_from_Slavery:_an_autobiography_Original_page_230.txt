RAISING MONEY 183 As an example of this, there are two ladies in New York, whose names rarelyappearinprint, but who, in a quietway,have given us the means with which to erect three large and important buildings during the last eight years. Besides the gift of these buildings, they have made other generous donations to the school. And they not only help Tuskegee, but they are constantly seeking opportunities to help other worthy causes.
 
 Although it has been my privilege to be the medium through which a good many hundred thousand dollars have been received for the work at Tuskegee, I have always avoided whatthe world calls "begging." I often tell people that I have never "begged" any money,and that I am not a "beggar." My experience and observation have convinced me that persistent asking outright for money from the rich does not, as a rule, secure help. I have usually proceeded on the principle that persons who possess sense enough to earn money have sense enough to know howto give it away, and thatthemere making known ofthe facts regarding Tuskegee, and especially the facts regarding the work ofthegraduates, has been more effective than outright begging. I think that the presentation offacts, on a high, dignified plane, is all the begging that most rich people care for.
