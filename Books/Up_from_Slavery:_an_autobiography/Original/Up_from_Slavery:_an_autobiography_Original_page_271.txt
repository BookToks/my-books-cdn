 Inconclusion,mayI repeat thatnothing inthirty years has given us more hope and encouragement, and drawn us so near to you ofthe white race, as this opportunity offered by the Exposition ; and here bending, as itwere, over the altar that represents the results of the struggles ofyour race and mine, both starting practically empty-handed three decades ago, I pledge that in your effort to work out thegreat and intricate problem which God has laidatthedoors ofthe South, you shall have at all times the patient, sympathetic help of my race; only letthis beconstantly inmind,that,while from representations inthese buildings ofthe product of field, of forest, of mine, of factory, letters, and art, much good will come, yet far above and beyond material benefits will be that higher good, that, let us pray God, will come, in a blotting out of sectional differences and racial animosities and suspicions, in a determination to administer absolute justice, in awilling obedience among all classes to themandates oflaw. This, this,coupled with our THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS 225 material prosperity, will bring into our beloved South a new heaven and a new earth.
