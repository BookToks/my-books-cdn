On the other hand, I am constantly embarrassed by the many acts of thoughtful kindness. The studentsdo not seem to want to see me carry a large book or asatchel or any kind of a burden through the grounds. In such cases more than one always offers to relieve me. I almost never go out of my office when the rain is falling that some student does not come to my side with an umbrella and ask to be allowed to hold it over me.
 
 Whilewriting upon this subject, it is a pleasure for me to add that in all my contact with the white people of the South I have never received a single personal insult. The white people in and near Tuskegee, to an especial degree, seem to count it a privilege to show me allthe respectwithin their power, andoftengo out oftheir way todothis.
 
 Not very long ago I was making a journey between Dallas (Texas) and Houston. In some way it became knownin advancethat Iwas on the train. At nearly every station at which the train stopped, numbers ofwhite people,including inmost cases the officials of the town, came aboard and introduced themselves and thankedme heartily for the work that I was trying to do for the South.
 
 On another occasion, when I was making a trip 170 UP FROM SLAVERY from Augusta, Georgia, to Atlanta, being rather tiredfrommuch travel,I rode in a Pullman sleeper.
