In those days therewere not many buildings there, and room was very precious. There were seven other boys in the same roomwith me; most of them, however, students who had been there for some time. The sheets were quite a puzzle to me. The first night I slept under both of them, and the second night I slept on top of both of them; but by watching the other boys I learned my lesson in this, and have been trying to follow it ever since and to teach it to others.
 
 Iwas among the youngest ofthe students who were in Hampton at that time. Most of the students were men and women some as old as forty years of age. As I now recall the scene ofmy first year, I do not believe that one often has the opportunity of coming into contact with three or four hundred men andwomenwho were so tremendously in earnest as these men and women were. Every hour was occupied in study or work. Nearly all had had enough actual contact with the world to teach them the need of education. Many of the older ones were, of course, too old to master the text-books very thoroughly, and it was often sad to watch their struggles; but they made up in earnestness much of what they lacked in books.
 
 Many of them were as poor as I was, and, besides having to wrestle with their books, they had to 62 UP FROM SLAVERY struggle with a povertywhich prevented their havingthe necessities oflife.
