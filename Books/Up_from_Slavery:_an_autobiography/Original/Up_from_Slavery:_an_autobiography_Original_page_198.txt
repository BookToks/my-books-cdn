The making of these bricks taught me an important lesson inregardtotherelations of the two races in the South. Many white people who had had no contact with the school, and perhaps no sympathy with it, came tous tobuy bricks because they found outthat ours were good bricks. They discovered that we were supplying a real want in the community. Themakingofthesebrickscaused many of the white residents ofthe neighbourhood tobegin to feel thatthe education ofthe Negro was not making him worthless, but that in educating our students we were adding something to the wealth and comfort of the community. As the people of the neighbourhood came to us to buy bricks, we got acquainted with them; they traded with us and we with them. Our business interests became intermingled. We had something which they wanted; theyhadsomething which we wanted.
 
 This, in a large measure,helped to lay the foundation for the pleasant relations that havecontinued to exist between us and the white people in that section, and which now extend throughout the South.
