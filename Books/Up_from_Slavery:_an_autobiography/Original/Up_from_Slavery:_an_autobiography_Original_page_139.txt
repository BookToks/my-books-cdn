The Indians, in the Indian Territory, owned a large number ofslaves during thedays of slavery. Aside from this, there was a general feeling that the attempt to educate and civilize the red men at Hamptonwould be a failure. All this made me proceed verycautiously, for I felt keenly the great responsibility. But I was determined to succeed. Itwas not long before Ihad the complete confidence ofthe Indians, and not onlythis, but I think I am safe in saying that I had their love and respect. I found that they were about like any other humanbeings; that they responded to kind treatment and resented ill-treatment. They were continually planning to do something that would add to my happiness and comfort. The things that they disliked most, I think, were to have their long hair cut,to give up wearing their blankets, and to cease smoking; but no white American ever thinks that any other race is wholly civilized until he wears the white man's clothes, eats the white man's food, speaks the white man's language, and professes the white man's religion.
 
 When the difficulty of learning the English language was subtracted, I found that in the matter BLACK RACE AND RED RACE 99 oflearning trades and inmastering academic studies therewas little difference between the coloured and Indianstudents.
