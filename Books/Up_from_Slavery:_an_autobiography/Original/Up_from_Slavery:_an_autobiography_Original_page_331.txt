 The love ofpleasure andexcitement which seems in a large measure to possess the French people impressed itself upon me. I think they are more noted in this respect than is true of the people of my own race. In point of morality and moral earnestness I do not believe that the French are ahead of my own race in America. Severe competition and the great stress oflife have led them to learn to do things more thoroughly and to exercisegreater economy; but time, I think, will bring my race to the same point. Inthe matter of truth and high honour I do not believe that the average Frenchman is ahead of theAmerican Negro; while so far as mercy and kindness todumb animals go, I believe that myrace is far ahead. In fact, when I left France, I had more faith inthefuture of the black man in Americathan I had ever possessed.
