THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS 231 I think that for ayear after the publication of this article every association and every conference or religious body of any kind, of my race, that met, did not fail before adjourning to pass a resolution condemning me, or calling upon me to retract or modify what I had said. Manyofthese organizations went so far in their resolutions as to advise parents to cease sending theirchildren to Tuskegee.
 
 One association even appointed a "missionary" whose dutyitwas towarnthe people against sending their children to Tuskegee. This missionary hadason in the school, and I noticed that, whatever the "missionary" might have said or done with regard to others, he was careful not to take his son away from the institution. Many of the coloured papers, especially those that were the organs of religious bodies, joined in the general chorus of condemnation or demands for retraction.
 
 During the whole time of the excitement, and through all the criticism,Idid not utteraword of explanation or retraction. Iknewthat I was right, and that time and the sober second thought ofthe people would vindicateme. Itwas not long before the bishops and other church leadersbeganto make a careful investigationofthe conditions ofthe ministry, and they found out that I was right. In fact, the oldestandmostinfluential bishop inone branch 232 UP FROM SLAVERY of the Methodist Church said thatmywords were far too mild.
