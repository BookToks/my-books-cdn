 Ihaveoftenbeen asked how I began the practice of public speaking. In answer I would say that I neverplanned to give anylarge part of my life tospeakinginpublic, I havealways bad more of an ambition to do things than merely to talk about doing them. It seems that when I went North with General Armstrong to speak at the series ofpublic meetings to which I have referred, the President of the National Educational Association, the Hon. Thomas W. Bicknell, was presentat one of those meetings and heard me speak.
 
 Afew days afterward he sent me an invitation to deliver an address at the next meeting of the Educational Association. This meeting was to be held in Madison, Wis. I accepted the invitation.
 
 Thiswas, in a sense,the beginning ofmy publicspeakingcareer.
