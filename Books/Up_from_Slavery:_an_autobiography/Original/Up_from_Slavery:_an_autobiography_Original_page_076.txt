They soon loseambition to do anything else than to continue as a coal-miner.
 
 Inthose days, and later as ayoungman, I used to try to picture inmy imaginationthe feelings and ambitions of a white boy with absolutely no limit placed upon his aspirations and activities. I used toenvythe whiteboywho had no obstacles placed in the way of his becoming a Congressman,Governor,Bishop,or Presidentbyreasonoftheaccident ofhis birth or race. Iused to picture theway that Iwould actunder such circumstances; how I would beginatthebottomand keeprisinguntil Ireached thehighest roundofsuccess.
 
 In later years, I confess that I do notenvy the white boy as I once did. I have learnedthatsuccessistobemeasurednotso much bythe position thatonehas reachedinlife asbytheobstacleswhich he has overcomewhile trying to succeed. Looked at from this standpoint, I almost reachthe conclusionthatoftentheNegroboy'sbirthandconnection UP FROM SLAVERY 40 with an unpopular race is an advantage,so far as real life is concerned.
