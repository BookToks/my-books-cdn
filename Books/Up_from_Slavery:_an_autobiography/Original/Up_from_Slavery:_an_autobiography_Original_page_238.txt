Carnegie's interest and help. The first time I saw him, ten years ago, he seemed to take but little interest in our school, but Iwas determined to show him that we were worthy of his help. After ten years of hard work I wrotehim a letter reading as follows : December 15, 1900.
 
 Mr. Andrew Carnegie, 5 W. Fifty-first St., New York.
 
 Dear Sir: Complying with the request which you made ofmewhen I sawyou atyour residence a fewdays ago, I now submit inwritingan appeal for a library buildingfor ourinstitution.
 
 Wehave 1100 students,86 officers and instructors, together with their families,and about 200 coloured people living near theschool, allofwhomwould make useofthe library building.
 
 We have over 12,000 books, periodicals, etc., gifts from our friends,but we have no suitable place for them,and wehave no suitable reading-room.
 
 Ourgraduates goto work inevery sectionofthe South, andwhatever knowledge mightbeobtained in the library would serve to assist intheelevationofthewhole Negro race.
 
 Such a building aswe needcould be erected for about $20,000. All of the work for the building, such as brickmaking, brick-masonry,carpentry,blacksmithing, etc., would be done bythe students. The money which you would give would not only supply the building, but the 192 UP FROM SLAVERY erection ofthe buildingwouldgivealarge numberof students an opportunityto learnthebuilding trades, and the students would usethe moneypaidtothemto keep themselves in school.
