 We tried several locations before we opened up a pit that furnished brick clay. I had always supposed that brickmaking was very simple, but I soon found out by bitter experience that it required special skill and knowledge, particularly in the burning of the bricks. After a gooddeal of effortwemouldedabout twenty-fivethousand bricks, andput them into a kilntobe burned. This kiln turned out tobe a failure,because itwas not properly constructed or properly burned. We began at once, however, on a second kiln. This, for some reason, also proved a failure. The failure of this kiln made it still more difficult to get the students to take any part in the work. Several ofthe teachers, however, who had been trained in the industries at Hampton,volunteered their services, and in some way we succeeded in getting a third kiln ready for burning. The burning ofa kiln required about a week. Toward the latter 152 UP FROM SLAVERY part of the week, when it seemed as if we were going to have a good many thousand bricks in a few hours, in the middle ofthe night the kiln fell.
