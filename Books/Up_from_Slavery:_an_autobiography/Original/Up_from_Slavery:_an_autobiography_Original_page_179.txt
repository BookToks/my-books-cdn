In this we have been successful to a degree that makes me feel safe in saying that the season now has a new meaning,notonlythrough all thatimmediateregion, but, in a measure, wherever our graduates have gone.
 
 At the present time oneof the most satisfactory featuresofthe Christmas and Thanksgiving seasons at Tuskegee is the unselfish and beautiful way in which our graduates and students spend their time in administering to the comfort and happiness of others, especially the unfortunate. Not long ago some of our young men spent a holiday in rebuilding a cabin for a helpless coloured woman who is about seventy-five yearsold. At another time I remember that I made it known inchapel,one night, that a very poor studentwas suffering fromcold,becausehe neededacoat. Thenextmorning twocoats were sent to my office for him.
 
 I have referred to the dispositiononthe part of the white people in the town of Tuskegee and vicinity to help the school. From the first, I resolved to make the school areal part of the community in which itwas located. I was determined that no one should have the feeling that itwas a foreign institution,dropped down inthe midst of ANXIOUS DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS 137 the people, for which they had no responsibility and inwhich theyhad no interest.
