Inthe line therewere alsovarious other officers and professors, cladincap and gown.
 
 In this orderwe marchedto SandersTheatre, where, after the usual Commencement exercises, came the conferring ofthe honorarydegrees. This, it seems, is always considered the most interesting feature at Harvard. It is not known, until the individuals appear, upon whom the honorary degrees are to be conferred, and those receiving these honours are cheered by the students and others inproportion to their popularity. During the conferring of the degrees excitement and enthusiasm are atthe highest pitch.
 
 When my namewas called, I rose, and President Eliot, in beautiful and strong English, conferred upon me the degree of Master of Arts. After these exercises were over, those who had received honorary degrees were invited to lunch with the President. After the lunch we were formed in line again, and were escortedbythe Marshal ofthe day, who that year happenedto be Bishop William Lawrence, through the grounds, where, at different points, thosewho had beenhonouredwere calledby name and received the Harvard yell. This march LAST WORDS 299 ended at Memorial Hall, where the alumni dinner was served.
