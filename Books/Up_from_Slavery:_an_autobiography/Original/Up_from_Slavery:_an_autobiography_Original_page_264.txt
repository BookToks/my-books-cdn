CHAPTER XIV THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS HE Atlanta Exposition, at which I had been asked to make an address as arepresentative of the Negro race, as stated in the last chapter, was opened with a short address from Governor Bullock. After other interesting exercises, including an invocation from Bishop Nelson, ofGeorgia, a dedicatoryode by Albert Howell, Jr., and addresses by the President of the Exposition and Mrs. Joseph Thompson, the President of the Woman's Board,Governor Bullock introduced me with the words, "We have with us to-day a representative ofNegro enterprise andNegro civilization." When I arose to speak, there was considerable cheering, especially from the coloured people. As I remember it now,the thing that was uppermost in my mind was the desire to say something that would cement the friendship oftheraces and bring about hearty cooperation between them. So far as my outward surroundings were concerned,the only 217 218 UP FROM SLAVERY thingthat I recall distinctly now is thatwhen I got up, I saw thousands of eyes looking intently into my face.
