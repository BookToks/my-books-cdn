It was not and is not a mere educational task.
 
 Anybody could teach boys trades and givethem an elementary education. Such tasks have been done since the beginning of civilization. But this task had to be done with the rawest of raw material, done within the civilization of the dominant race, and so done as not to run across race lines and social lines that are the strongest forces in the community. It had to be done for the benefit of the whole community. It had to be done,moreover, without local help, inthe face ofthe direst poverty, doneby begging, and done inspite ofthe ignorance ofone race and the prejudice ofthe other.
 
 No man living had a harder task, and atask that called for more wisdom to do it right. The true measure of Mr. Washington's success is,then, not his teaching the pupils of Tuskegee, nor even gaining the support of philanthropic persons at a distance, but thisâ€”that every Southernwhite man of character and ofwisdom has been won to a cordial recognition ofthe value ofthe work, even men who held and still hold to the conviction that a mere INTRODUCTION xix book education for the Southern blacks under present conditions is a positive evil.
