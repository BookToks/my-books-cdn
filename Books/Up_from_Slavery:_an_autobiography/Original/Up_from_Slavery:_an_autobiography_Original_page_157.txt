In the case to which I have referred, where the family satdown to the table for themeal atwhich I was their guest, I could seeplainlythat thiswas an awkward and unusual proceeding,andwas done in myhonour. Inmostcases,whenthe familygot up in the morning,for example,the wifewould put a piece of meat in a frying-pan and put a lump of dough in a "skillet," as theycalledit. These utensilswould be placed on the fire, and in ten or fifteen minutes breakfastwould be ready. Frequently the husbandwould takehisbreadand meat inhis hand and start for the field, eating as he walked. The mother would sit down in a corner and eat her breakfast,perhaps from aplate and perhaps directly from the "skillet " or frying-pan, while the children would eat their portion of the breadandmeat while running abouttheyard. At certain seasons of the year,when meat was scarce, it was rarelythat the childrenwho were not old enough or strong enough towork inthe fields would have the luxuryofmeat.
 
 The breakfast over, andwith practically no attentiongiven to the house,thewhole family would, as ageneral thing, proceed to the cotton-field. Every child thatwas large enough to carry ahoewas put towork, and the baby—for usually there was at EARLY DAYS AT TUSKEGEE 115 least one baby—wouldbe laiddown atthe end of the cotton row, so that its mother could give it a certain amount ofattention when she had finished chopping her row.
