This is a demonstration of the efficiency ofthe Hampton-Tuskegee idea that stands like the demonstration of the value of democratic institutions themselves—a demonstrationmade so clear in spite ofthe greatest odds thatit is no longer open to argument.
 
 Consider the change that has come in twenty years in the discussion of the Negro problem.
 
 Two or three decades ago social philosophers and statisticians and well-meaning philanthropists were still talking and writing about the deportation of the Negroes, or about their settlement within some restricted area, or about their settling in all parts of the Union, or about their decline through their neglect of their children, or about their rapid multiplication till theyshould expel the whites from the South—of every sort of nonsense under heaven.
 
 All this has given place to the simple plan of an indefinite extension among the neglected classes of both races of the Hampton-Tuskegee system of training. The "problem" in one sense has disappeared. The future will have for the South swift or slow development of its masses and of its soil in proportion to the swift or slowdevelopment of this kind of training. This change of view is a true measure of Mr. Washington's work.
