I was the only white man under the roof, and the scene and the songs made an impression onme that I shall never forget. Mr. Washington arose and asked them to sing one after another of the old melodies that I had heard all my life; but I had never before heard them sung by athousand voices nor by the voices of educated Negroes. I had associated them with the Negro of the past, notwiththe Negro who was struggling upward. They brought to my mind the plantation, the cabin, the slave, not the freedman in quest of education. But on the plantation and in the cabin they had never been sung as these thousand students sang them. I saw again all the old plantations that I had ever seen; the whole history of the Negro ran through my mind; and the inexpressible pathos of his life found expression in these songs as I had never before felt it.
 
 And the future? These were the ambitious youths of the race, at work with an earnestness that put to shame the conventional student life of most educational institutions. Another song rolled up along the rafters. And as soon as silence came, I found myself in front of this extraordinary mass of faces, thinking not ofthem, but ofthat long and unhappy chapter in our country's history which followed the one great structural mistake of the INTRODUCTION XV Fathers of the Republic; thinking of the one continuous great problem that generations of statesmen hadwrangled over, and amillion menfought about, and that had sodwarfed the mass of English men in the Southern States as to hold them back a hundred years behind their fellows in every other part oftheworldâ€”in England, in Australia, and in the Northern and Western States; I was thinking of this dark shadow that had oppressed every largeminded statesmanfrom Jefferson to Lincoln.
