I have taken pains to go to the bottom of things and get facts, in a cold, business-like manner.
 
 I have seen the statement made lately, by one who claims to knowwhat he is talkingabout, that, taking the whole Negro race into account, ninety per cent of the Negro women are not virtuous.
 
 There never was a baser falsehood uttered concerning a race, or a statement madethatwas less capable ofbeing proved by actual facts.
 
 No one can come into contactwith the race for twenty years, as I have done in the heart of the South, without being convinced that the race is constantlymaking slowbutsure progress materially, educationally, and morally. One might take up the life ofthe worst element in New York City, for example, and prove almost anything hewanted to prove concerning thewhite man,but allwill agree thatthis is notafair test.
 
 Earlyin theyear 1897 I received a letterinviting me to deliver an address at the dedication of the Robert Gould Shaw monument in Boston. I acceptedthe invitation. It is not necessary for me, I amsure, to explainwho Robert Gould Shaw was, 250 UP FROM SLAVERY andwhathedid.
