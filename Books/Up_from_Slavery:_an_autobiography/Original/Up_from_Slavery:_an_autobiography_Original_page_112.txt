Ever since then I have had no patience with any school for my raceinthe Southwhich did not teach its students thedignity of labour.
 
 During mylastyearat Hampton everyminute of my time thatwas not occupiedwith my duties as janitor was devoted to hard study. I was determined, if possible, to make such a record in my class aswouldcausemetobeplacedonthe"honour roll" of Commencement speakers. This I was successful in doing. Itwas June of 1875 when I finished the regular course of study at Hampton.
 
 Thegreatestbenefitsthat I gotout of mylifeatthe Hampton Institute,perhaps,maybe classified under two heads : Firstwas contactwith agreatman, General S. C.
 
 Armstrong, who, I repeat,was, in my opinion, the rarest, strongest,and mostbeautiful character that it has ever been my privilege to meet.

 Before going there I had a good deal of the then rather prevalent idea amongour people that to secureaneducationmeantto have a good, easy time, freefromall necessityformanuallabour. AtHampton I not only learned that itwas not a disgrace to labour,but learned to love labour, not alone for its 74 UP FROM SLAVERY financial value,but forlabour's ownsakeand for the independence and self-reliance which the ability to do something which the worldwants done brings.
