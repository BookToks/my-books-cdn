I tried to emphasizethe factthatwhiletheNegro should not bedeprived by unfairmeans ofthe franchise, political agitation alonewould not save him, and that back ofthe ballothe must have property, industry, skill, economy, intelligence, and character, and that no race without these elements could permanently succeed. I said that in granting the appropriation Congress could do something that would prove to be ofreal and lastingvalue to both races, and that itwas the first great opportunity of thekind that had been presented sincethe close of the Civil War.
 
 I spoke for fifteen or twenty minutes, and was surprised at the close of my address to receive the hearty congratulations of the Georgia committee and ofthe members of Congress who were present.
 
 The Committee was unanimous in making a favourable report, and in a fewdays the bill passed Congress. With the passing ofthis bill the success ofthe Atlanta Exposition was assured.
 
 Soon after this trip toWashington the directors of the Exposition decidedthat itwould be a fitting recognition ofthecoloured race to erect a large and attractive buildingwhich should be devotedwholly to showing the progress oftheNegro since freedom.
