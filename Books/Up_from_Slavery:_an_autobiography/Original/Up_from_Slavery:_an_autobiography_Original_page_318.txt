When I hadbeen awayfrom home two weeks, I received the following letter from him: Tuskegee, Alabama.

 My youngest child, Ernest Davidson Washington, says that he is going to be a physician. In addition to going to school,where he studies books and has manual training, he regularly spends a portion of his time in the office of our resident physician, and has already learned to do many of the duties which pertain to adoctor's office.
 
 The thing in mylifewhich brings me thekeenest regret is that my work in connection with public affairs keeps me for so much ofthe time away from my family, where, of all places in the world, I delight to be. I always envy the individual whose life-work is so laid that hecan spend his evenings at home. I have sometimes thought that people who have this rare privilegedo not appreciate it as 270 UP FROM SLAVERY they should.
