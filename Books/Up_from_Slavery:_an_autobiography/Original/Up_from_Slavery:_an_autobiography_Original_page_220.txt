In the earlydays we had veryfew students who had been used to handling carpenters' tools, and the bedsteads madeby the students thenwere very rough and very weak. Not unfrequently when I went into the students' rooms in the morning I would find at least two bedsteads lying about on the floor. The problem of providing mattresses was a difficult one to solve. We finally mastered this, however, by getting some cheap cloth and sewing pieces of this together so as to make large bags. These bags we filledwith the pine strawâ€” or, as it is sometimes called, pine needles which we secured fromthe forests near by. I am glad to saythat the industry of mattress-making has grown steadily since then, and has been improved to such an extentthatatthe present time itis animportant branch of thework which is taught systematically to a number of our girls, and that the mattresses that nowcome outof the mattress-shop at Tuskegee are about as good as those bought in the average store. For some time after the opening of the boarding departmentwe had no chairs in the students' bedrooms or in the dining rooms. Instead of chairs we used stools which the students con 174 UP FROM SLAVERY structed by nailing together three pieces of rough board.
