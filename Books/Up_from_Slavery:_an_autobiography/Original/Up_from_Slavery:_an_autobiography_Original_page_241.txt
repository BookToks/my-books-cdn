M. F. Foster,the member ofthe Legislature from Tuskegee. Second,we received one thousand dollars from the John F. Slater Fund. Our work seemed to please the trustees of this fund, as they soon began increasing their annual grant. This has been added to from timeto timeuntil at present we receive eleven thousand dollars annually from this Fund. The other help to which I have referred came in the shapeofan allowance from the Peabody Fund. This wasat first fivehundreddollars,but it has sincebeen increased to fifteen hundreddollars.
 
 The effort to secure help from the Slater and Peabody Funds brought me into contactwith two rare menâ€”menwho have had much todo in shaping the policy for the education of the Negro. I refer to the Hon. J. L. M. Curry, of Washington, who is the general agent for these two funds, and Mr. Morris K. Jesup, of New York. Dr. Curry is a native of the South, an ex-Confederate soldier, yet I do not believe there is any man in the country who is more deeply interested in the highest welfare of the Negro than Dr. Curry, or one who is more free from race prejudice. He enjoys the unique distinction ofpossessing to an equal degree the confidence of the black man and the Southern white man. I shall never forget the first time I met him. Itwas in Richmond, Va., where he was RAISING MONEY 195 then living.
