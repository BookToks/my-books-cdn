At the end ofthree monthsenough was securedtorepaythe loanoftwo hundred and fifty dollars to General Marshall, and within two months more we had secured the entire five hundreddollars andhad receivedadeedoftheone hundred acres of land. Thisgaveus a great deal of satisfaction. Itwas not onlya source ofsatisfaction tosecure a permanent location for theschool, but itwas equally satisfactoryto know that thegreater partof the money withwhich itwas paid for had been gotten from the whiteandcoloured people in the town of Tuskegee. The most ofthis money was obtained by holding festivals andconcerts,and from small individualdonations.
 
 Our nexteffortwas inthedirection ofincreasing the cultivation of the land, so as to secure some returnfrom it, and at the same time givethestudents training in agriculture. All the industries at Tuskegee have been started in natural and logical order, growing out of the needs ofacommunity settlement. We began with farming, because we wantedsomething toeat.
