Not a few times, when a newstudent has been led into the temptation of marring the looks of some building by leadpencil marks or bythe cuts ofajack-knife, Ihaveheardanold student remind him: "Don't do that. That is our building. I helped putitup." Intheearlydays of theschool I think my most trying experiencewasinthe matter of brickmaking.
 
 As soon as wegot the farm work reasonablywell started, we directed our next efforts toward the industryof making bricks. We needed these for use in connection with the erection of our own buildings; but therewas also anotherreasonfor establishing this industry. There was no brickyard inthetown, and inadditionto ourown needs there wasademand forbricksinthegeneral market.
 
 I had always sympathized with the "Children ofIsrael," in theirtask of"making bricks without straw," butourswasthe task ofmakingbricks with nomoneyand noexperience.
