UP FROM SLAVERY 4 In the centreof theearthen floor therewas a large, deep opening covered with boards, which was used as a place inwhich to store sweet potatoes during the winter. An impression of this potato-hole is very distinctly engraved upon mymemory,because I recall that during the process of putting the potatoes in ortakingthem out Iwould often come into possession of one ortwo,which I roasted and thoroughly enjoyed. There was no cooking-stove on our plantation, and all the cooking for the whites and slaves my mother had to do over an open fireplace, mostly in pots and "skillets." While the poorly built cabin caused us to suffer with cold in the winter, the heat from the open fireplace insummerwas equally trying.
 
 The early years of my life, which were spent in the little cabin, were not very different from those of thousands of other slaves. My mother, of course, had little time inwhich togive attention to the training of her children during the day. She snatched a few moments for our care in the early morning before herwork began, and at night after the day's work was done. One of my earliest recollections is that ofmy mother cooking achicken late at night, and awakening her children for the purpose offeeding them. How or where she got it I do not know. I presume, however, itwas pro A SLAVE AMONG SLAVES 5 cured from our owner's farm.
