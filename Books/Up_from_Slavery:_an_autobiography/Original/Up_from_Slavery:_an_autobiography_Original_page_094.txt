I shall always rememberthat thefirst time Iwentintohispresence he made theimpressionuponme ofbeing aperfect man; I was made to feelthattherewas something abouthim that was superhuman. Itwas myprivilegetoknow theGeneral personally from the time I entered Hampton till hedied,and the more I saw ofhimthegreaterhegrewinmyestimation.
