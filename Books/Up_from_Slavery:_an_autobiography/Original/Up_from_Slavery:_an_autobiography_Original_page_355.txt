I think I never realized before this howmuch the white people of Tuskegee and vicinity thought of our institution.
 
 During the days when we were preparing for the President's reception, dozens ofthese people came to me and said that, while they did not want to push themselves intoprominence, if there was anything they could do to help, or to relieve me personally, I had but to intimate it and they would be only too glad to assist. In fact, the thing that touched me almost as deeply as the visit of the President itself was the deep pride which all classes of citizens in Alabama seemed to take in ourwork.
 
 The morning of December 16th brought to the little city of Tuskegee such a crowd as it had never seen before. With the President came Mrs.
 
 McKinley and all of the Cabinet officers but one ; and most of them brought their wives or some members of their families. Several prominent generals came, including General Shafter and General Joseph Wheeler, who were recently returned from the Spanish-American war. There was also a host ofnewspaper correspondents. TheAlabama Legislaturewas in session at Montgomery at this time.
 
 This body passed a resolution to adjourn for the LAST WORDS 307 purpose of visiting Tuskegee.
