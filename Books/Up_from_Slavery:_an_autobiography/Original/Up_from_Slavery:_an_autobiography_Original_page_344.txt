LAST WORDS 295 The death of General Armstrong, a few weeks later, gave me the privilege ofgetting acquainted with one of the finest, most unselfish, and most attractive men that I have ever come in contact with. I refer to the Rev. Dr. Hollis B. Frissell, now the Principal of the Hampton Institute, and General Armstrong's successor. Under the clear, strong, and almostperfect leadership ofDr. Frissell, Hamptonhas had a career ofprosperity and usefulness that is all that the General could havewished for. It seems to be the constant effort of Dr.
 
 Frissell to hide his own great personality behind that of General Armstrongâ€”to make himself of "no reputation" for the sake ofthe cause.
 
 More than once I have been askedwhat was the greatest surprise that ever came to me. I have little hesitation in answering that question.
 
 It was the following letter, which came to me one Sunday morning when I was sitting on the veranda of my home at Tuskegee, surrounded by mywife and three children : HARVARD UNIVERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, MAY28,1896.
