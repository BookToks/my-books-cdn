In either case, my observations convinced me that the miners were worse off at the end of a strike. Before the days of strikes in that section of the country, I knew miners who had considerable money in the bank, but as soonas the professional labour agitatorsgot control,the savings of even the more thrifty ones began disappearing.
 
 My mother andthe other members of the family were, of course, much rejoiced to see me and to note the improvement that I hadmadeduring my two years' absence. The rejoicing on the part of all classes of thecoloured people, and especially the older ones, over my return, was almost pathetic.
 
 I had to pay a visit to each family and take ameal with each, and at each place tell the story of my experiences at Hampton. In addition to this I had to speak before the church and Sunday-school, and at various other places. The thing that I was most in search of, though, work, I could not find.
 
 There was no work on account of the strike. I spent nearly the whole ofthe firstmonth ofmy vacation in an effort to find something to do bywhich I couldearnmoneytopaymyway backtoHampton and savea little moneyto use afterreachingthere.
