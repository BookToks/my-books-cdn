Itwas also interesting to note how many big books some of them had studied, and how many high-sounding subjects some ofthem claimed to have mastered. The bigger the book and the longer the name of the subject, the prouder they felt of their accomplishment. Some had studied Latin, and one or two Greek. This they thought entitledthem tospecialdistinction.
 
 In fact, one of the saddest things I sawduring the month of travel which I have described was a young man, who had attended some high school, sitting down in a one-room cabin,with grease on his clothing, filth all around him, and weeds in the yard and garden, engaged in studying a French grammar.
 
 The students who came first seemed to be fond of memorizing long and complicated "rules" in grammar and mathematics,but had little thought or knowledge of applying these rules to the everyday affairs of their life. One subject which they liked to talk about, and tell me that they had mastered, in arithmetic, was "banking and discount," but I soon found out that neither they nor almost any one in the neighbourhoodinwhich they TEACHING SCHOOL 123 lived had ever had abank account.
