I resolved at once to go to that school, although I had no ideawhere itwas,or how many miles away, or how I was going to reach it; I remembered onlythat Iwas on fireconstantly with one ambition, and that was to go to Hampton.
 
 This thought was with me day and night.
 
 After hearing of the Hampton Institute, I continued towork for a few months longer inthe coalmine. While at work there, I heard of a vacant positioninthehousehold ofGeneral Lewis Ruffher, the owner of the salt-furnace and coal-mine. Mrs.
 
 Viola Ruffner, the wife of General Ruffner, was a "Yankee" woman from Vermont. Mrs. Ruffner had a reputation all through the vicinity for being very strict with her servants,and especially with the boys who tried to serve her. Few of them had remained with her more than two or three weeks.
 
 They all left with the same excuse : she was too strict. I decided, however, that I would rather try Mrs. Ruffner's house than remaininthe coal-mine, and so my mother applied to her for the vacant position. I was hired at a salary of $5 per month.
 
 I had heard so much about Mrs. Ruffner's severity that I was almost afraid to see her, and trembled when I went into her presence. I had not lived with her manyweeks, however, before I began to understand her. I soon began to learn 44 UP FROM SLAVERY that, first of all, she wanted everything kept clean about her, that she wanted things done promptly and systematically, and that atthe bottom ofeverything she wanted absolute honesty and frankness.
