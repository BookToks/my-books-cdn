Nothing must be sloven or slipshod; every door, every fence, must be kept in repair.
 
 I cannot now recall how long I lived with Mrs.
 
 Ruffner before going to Hampton, but I think it musthave been a year and a half. At any rate, I here repeatwhat I have saidmorethan once before, thatthe lessons that I learned in the home of Mrs.
 
 Ruffner were as valuable to me as anyeducation I have ever gotten anywhere since. Evento this day I never see bits of paper scattered around a house or in the street that I do notwantto pick them up at once. I never see a filthy yard that I do not want to clean it,a paling offofa fence that I do not want to put it on, an unpainted orunwhitewashed house that I do notwantto paint orwhitewash it, or a button off one's clothes, or a grease-spot on them or on a floor, that I do not want to call attention to it.
 
 From fearing Mrs. Ruffner I soon learned to look upon her as one of my bestfriends. When she found that she could trust me she did so implicitly. During the one or two winters that I was with her she gave me an opportunity to go to THE STRUGGLE FOR AN EDUCATION 45 school for an hour in the day during aportion of the winter months, but most of my studying was done at night, sometimes alone, sometimes under some one whom I could hire to teach me.
