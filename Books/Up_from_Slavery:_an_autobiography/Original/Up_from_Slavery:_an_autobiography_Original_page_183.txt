140 UP FROM SLAVERY When it became known in thetown that we were discussing the plans for a new, large building, a Southern white man who was operating a sawmill not far from Tuskegeecame to me andsaid that he would gladly putall the lumber necessary to erect the building onthegrounds,with no otherguarantee for payment than my word thatit would be paid for when we secured some money. I told the man frankly that at the time we did not have in our hands onedollar of the money needed. Notwithstanding this, he insisted on being allowed to put the lumber on the grounds. After we had secured some portion ofthe money we permitted him to do this.
 
 Miss Davidson againbegan the work ofsecuring in various ways small contributions for the new building from thewhite and coloured people in and near Tuskegee. I think I never saw a community ofpeople so happyover anything aswere thecoloured peopleoverthe prospect ofthis newbuilding.
 
 Oneday, when wewere holding ameetingto secure funds for its erection, an old,ante-bellum coloured man came adistance oftwelve miles and brought in his ox-cart a large hog. When themeetingwas in progress, herose in the midstofthecompany and said that he had no moneywhich he couldgive, but that he had raised two fine hogs, and thathe had ANXIOUS DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS 141 brought oneof them as acontribution toward the expenses ofthe building.
