INTRODUCTION xiii I got the cue to Mr.Washington's character from a very simple incident many years ago. I had never seen him, and I knew little about him, except that he was the head of a school at Tuskegee, Alabama. I had occasion to write to him, and I addressed him as "The Rev. Booker T. Washington." In his reply there was no mention of my addressing him as a clergyman. But when I had occasion to write to him again, and persisted in making him a preacher, his second letter brought a postscript: " I have no claim to ' Rev.'" I knew most of the coloured men who atthat time had become prominent as leaders of their race, but I had not then known one who was neither a politician nor a preacher; and I had not heard ofthe head of an important coloured school who was not a preacher. "A new kind of man in the coloured world," I said to myself-"a new kind of man surely if he looks uponhis task as an economic one insteadof atheological one." I wrote him an apology for mistaking him for a preacher.
 
 The first time that I went to Tuskegee I was asked to make an address to the school on Sunday evening. I sat upon the platform of the large chapel andlookedforth on athousandcolouredfaces, and the choir of a hundred or more behind me sang a familiar religious melody, and thewhole company xiv INTRODUCTION joined in the chorus with unction.
