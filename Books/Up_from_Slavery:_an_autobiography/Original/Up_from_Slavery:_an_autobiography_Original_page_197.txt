For the third time we had failed.
 
 The failure of this last kiln left me without a single dollar with which to make another experiment. Most of the teachers advised the abandoning of the effort to make bricks. In the midst of my troubles I thought of a watch which had come into my possession years before. I took this watch to the cityof Montgomery,which was not far distant, and placed it in apawn-shop. I secured cashupon it to the amountof fifteen dollars,with which to renew the brickmaking experiment. I returned to Tuskegee, and, with the help of the fifteen dollars, rallied our rather demoralized and discouraged forces and began a fourth attempt to make bricks. This time, I am glad to say, we were successful. Before I got hold ofanymoney, the time-limit onmywatch had expired, and I have never seen it since; but I have never regrettedthe lossofit.
 
 Brickmaking has now become such an important industry at the school that lastseason ourstudents manufactured twelve hundred thousand offirst-class bricks, ofa qualitysuitable to be sold in any market. Aside from this, scores ofyoung men have MAKING BRICKS WITHOUT STRAW 153 mastered the brickmaking trade—both the making of bricks by hand and by machinery—and are now engaged inthis industry in manyparts of the South.
