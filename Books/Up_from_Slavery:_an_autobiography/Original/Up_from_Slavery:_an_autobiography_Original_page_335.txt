286 UP FROM SLAVERY On various occasions Mrs. Washington and I were the guests of Englishmen in their country homes, where, I think, one sees theEnglishman at his best. In one thing, at least, Ifeel sure thatthe English are ahead ofAmericans, and that is, that they have learned how to get more out of life.
 
 The home life of the English seems to me to be about as perfect as anything can be. Everything moves like clockwork. Iwas impressed,too, with the deference that the servants show to their "masters" and "mistresses,"â€”terms which I suppose would not be tolerated inAmerica. The English servant expects, as a rule, to be nothingbut a servant, and so he perfects himself in the art to a degree that no class ofservants inAmerica has yet reached. In our country the servant expects to become, in few years, a "master" himself.
 
 a Which system is preferable? I will not venture an answer.
 
 Another thing that impressed itself upon me throughout England was the high regard that all classes have for law and order, and the ease and thoroughness with which everything is done. The Englishmen, I found, took plenty oftime for eating, as for everything else. I amnotsure if, in the long tun, they do not accomplish as much or more than rushing, nervousAmericansdo.
