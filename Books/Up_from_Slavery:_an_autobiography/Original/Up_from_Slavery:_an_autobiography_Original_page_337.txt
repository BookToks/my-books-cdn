There must have been at leastthree hundred persons at this reception. Twice during the evening the Duchess sought us out for a conversation, andshe asked me to write her when we got home, and tell her more about the work at Tuskegee. This I did. When Christmas came we were surprised and delighted to receive her photograph with her autograph on it. The correspondence has continued,and we now feel that in the Duchess of Sutherland we have one of our warmest friends.
 
 After three months in Europe we sailed from Southampton in the steamship St. Louis. On this steamer therewas a fine librarythat had been presented to the ship by the citizens of St. Louis, Mo. In this library I found a life of Frederick Douglass, which I began reading. I became especially interested in Mr. Douglass's description of theway he was treated onshipboard during his first or second visit to England. In this descriptionhe told howhewas not permitted to enter the cabin, buthad toconfine himself to the deck ofthe ship. A few minutes after I had finished reading this description I waswaited on byacommittee of ladies and gentlemen with the requestthat I deliver an address at aconcertwhichwas to be given the following evening. Andyet there are people who EUROPE 289 are bold enough to say that race feeling inAmerica is not growing less intense!
