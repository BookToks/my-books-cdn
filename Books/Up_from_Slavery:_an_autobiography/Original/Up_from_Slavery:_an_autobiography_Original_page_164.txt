I do not know two men, one an ex-slaveholder, one an exslave, whose advice and judgment I would feel more like following in everything which concerns the life and development of the school at Tuskegee than those ofthese two men.
 
 I have always felt that Mr. Adams,in a large degree, derived his unusual power of mind from the training given his hands in the process of mastering well three trades during the days of slavery. If one goes to-day into any Southern town, and asks for the leading and most reliable coloured man in the community, I believe that in five cases outoften hewill be directed to aNegro who learned a tradeduringthe days ofslavery.
 
 On the morning that the school opened, thirty students reported for admission. I was the only teacher. The students were about equallydivided between the sexes. Most of them lived in Macon County, the county in which Tuskegee is situated, and ofwhich it is the county-seat. A greatmany morestudentswanted to enter the school,but ithad been decided to receive only thosewho were above fifteen years ofage,and who had previouslyreceived some education. The greater part of the thirty were public-school teachers, and some ofthem were nearly forty years ofage. With the teachers came UP FROM SLAVERY 122 some of their former pupils,and when they were examineditwas amusingtonote thatin several cases the pupil entered a higher classthandid his former teacher.
