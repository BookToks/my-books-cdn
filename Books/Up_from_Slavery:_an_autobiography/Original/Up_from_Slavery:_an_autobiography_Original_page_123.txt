" In the earlier days offreedom almost every coloured manwho learned toreadwould receive "a call to preach" within a fewdays after he began reading. At myhome in West Virginia the process of being called to the ministrywas a very interesting one. Usually the "call" came when the individual was sitting in church. Withoutwarning the one calledwould fall upon the floor as ifstruck bya bullet, andwould lie thereforhours,speechless andmotionless. Thenthe news would spread all through the neighbourhood that this individual had received a"call." If he were inclined to resist the summons,he would fall or be made to fall a second orthirdtime. In the end he always yielded tothe call. While I wanted an education badly, I confess that in myyouth I had a fear that when I had learned to read and writewell I would receive one ofthese "calls " ; but, for some reason,my call never came.
 
 Whenweaddthe number ofwhollyignorantmen who preached or "exhorted" to that of those who possessed something of aneducation,itcanbe seen at a glance that the supplyof ministers was large.
 
 Infact, some time ago I knewacertain church that THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD 83 hadatotalmembership of about two hundred, and eighteenofthat numberwere ministers.
