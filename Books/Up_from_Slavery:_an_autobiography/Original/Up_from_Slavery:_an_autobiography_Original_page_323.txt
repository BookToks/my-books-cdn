There were many important National questions bearing upon the life ofthe race which werebeing agitated at that time, and this made itall the harderfor us to decide to go. We finally gave our Boston friends our promise that we would go, and then they insisted that the date of our departure be set as soon as possible. So we decided upon May 10. My good friend Mr. Garrison kindly took charge of all the details necessary forthe success of the trip, and he, as well as other friends, gave us a great number of letters of introduction to people in France and England, and made other arrangements for our comfort and convenience abroad.
 
 Good-bys were said at Tuskegee, and we were in New York May 9, readyto sail the nextday. Our daughter Portia, who was then studying in South Framingham, Mass., came to NewYork to see us off. Mr. Scott, my secretary, came with me to New York, in orderthat I mightclear up the last bit of business before I left. Other friends also came to New York to see us off. Just before we went on board the steamer another pleasant surprise came to us in the form of a letterfrom two generous ladies, stating that they had decided to giveus the moneywith whichto erect a new build- EUROPE 275 ing to be used in properly housing all our industries for girls at Tuskegee.
