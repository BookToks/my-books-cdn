Irememberthat at one time I saw two ofmy youngmistresses and some lady visitors eatingginger-cakes,intheyard. Atthattime those cakesseemed tometobeabsolutelythe most tempting and desirable things that I hadeverseen; and I then and there resolved that, if Iever got free, the height of my ambitionwouldbereachedif I could get to the point where I could secure and eat ginger-cakes in the way that I saw those ladies doing.
 
 Of course as the war was prolonged the white people, in many cases, often found it difficult to secure food for themselves. I think the slaves felt the deprivation less than the whites, because the usual diet for the slaves was corn bread and pork, and these could be raised on the plantation; but coffee, tea, sugar, and other articles which the whites had been accustomed to use could not be raised on the plantation, and theconditions brought about by the war frequently made it impossible to secure these things. Thewhites were ofteningreat straits. Parched corn was used for coffee, and a kind of black molasses was used instead ofsugar.
 
 Many times nothingwas used to sweeten the socalledteaand coffee.
