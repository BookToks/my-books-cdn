Throughout our stay in London Ambassador Choatewas most kind and attentive to us. At theAmbassador's reception I met, for the firsttime, Mark Twain.
 
 We were the guests several times of Mrs. T.
 
 Fisher Unwin, the daughter of the English statesman, Richard Cobden. It seemed as if both Mr.
 
 and Mrs. Unwin could not do enough for our comfort and happiness. Later, for nearly a week, we were the guests of the daughter of John Bright, now Mrs. Clark, of Street, England. Both Mr.
 
 and Mrs. Clark, with their daughter, visited us at Tuskegee the next year. In Birmingham, England, we were the guests for several days of Mr.
 
 Joseph Sturge, whose father was agreat abolitionist and friend of Whittier and Garrison. It was a great privilege to meet throughout England those who had known and honoured the late William Lloyd Garrison, the Hon. Frederick Douglass, and other abolitionists. The English abolitionists with whom we came in contact never seemed to tire of talking about these two Americans. Before going to England I had had no proper conception ofthe deep interest displayedbythe abolitionists of England in the cause of freedom, nor did I realize the amount ofsubstantial help given by them.
 
 In Bristol, England, both Mrs. Washington and EUROPE 285 I spoke at the Women's Liberal Club.
