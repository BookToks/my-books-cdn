EARLY DAYS AT TUSKEGEE III recall that oneman,whoseemedto havebeendesignated by the others to look after mypolitical destiny,came to me on several occasions andsaid,with agood deal of earnestness: "Wewants you tobe sure to vote jes' likewe votes. We can't read de newspapers verymuch,butwe knows how tovote, an' we wants you to vote jes' likewe votes." He added: " Wewatches de white man,and wekeeps watching dewhite man tillwe finds outwhichway dewhiteman'sgwinetovote; an' whenwefinds out which way de white man's gwine to vote,den we votes 'xactly de other way. Den we knows we's right." I am glad to add, however, that at the present time the disposition tovote against thewhite man merelybecause he iswhite is largely disappearing, and the raceislearningtovote from principle, for whatthevoter considers tobeforthebest interests ofboth races.
 
 I reachedTuskegee,as I have said,earlyinJune, 1881. The first month Ispent in finding accommodations for the school,and intravelling through Alabama, examining intotheactual life of thepeople,especiallyinthecountrydistricts,and ingetting theschooladvertised among theclass ofpeoplethat Iwantedtohaveattend it. The mostof mytravellingwasdone overthe country roads,withamule 112 UP FROM SLAVERY and a cart or a mule and a buggy wagon for conveyance.
