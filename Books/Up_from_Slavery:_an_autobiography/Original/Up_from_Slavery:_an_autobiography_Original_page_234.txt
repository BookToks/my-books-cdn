I had placedthissum inmywill for yourschool,butdeem it wiser to give it to you while I live. I recall with pleasureyourvisitto me twoyears ago." I can hardly imagine any occurrence which could have given me more genuine satisfaction than the receipt of this draft. It was by far the largest single donation which up to that time the school had ever received. It came at a time when an unusually long period had passed since we had received any money. We were in great distress because of lack of funds, and the nervous strain was tremendous. It is difficultfor me to think of any situation that is more trying on the nerves than that of conducting a large institution, with heavy financial obligations to meet, without knowing where the money is to come from to meet these obligations from month to month.
 
 In our case I felt a double responsibility, and this made the anxiety all the more intense. If the institution had been officered by white persons, and hadfailed,it would haveinjuredthe cause ofNegro education; but I knewthatthe failure of our institution, officered by Negroes, would not onlymean the loss of a school, butwould cause people, in a largedegree, to lose faith in the ability ofthe entire race. The receipt of this draft for ten thousand 188 UP FROM SLAVERY dollars, under all these circumstances, partially lifted a burden that had been pressing down upon me for days.
