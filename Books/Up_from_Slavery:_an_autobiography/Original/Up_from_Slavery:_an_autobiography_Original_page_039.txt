Inthis cabin I livedwith my mother and a brother and sister till after the Civil War, when we were all declared free.
 
 Of my ancestry I know almost nothing. In the slavequarters, and even later, I heardwhisperedconversations among thecoloured peopleofthetortures which the slaves, including, no doubt, my ancestors onmy mother's side, suffered inthe middle passage of the slave shipwhile being conveyed from Africa to America. I have been unsuccessful in securing anyinformation that would throw anyaccurate light upon the historyof my family beyond my mother.
 
 She, I remember, had a half-brother and a halfsister. In the days of slavery notvery much attentionwas given to family history and family records â€”that is,black familyrecords. Mymother,I suppose, attracted the attention of a purchaser whowas afterward my owner andhers. Her addition to the slave family attracted about as much attention as the purchase of a new horse or cow. Of my father I know even less than of my mother. I do not even know his name. I have heard reports to the effect that he was awhite manwho lived on one of the near-by plantations. Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not A SLAVE AMONG SLAVES 3 find especial fault with him.
