 A number of coloured men—some of them very strong and brilliant—were in the House of Representatives at that time,and one, the Hon. B. K.
 
 Bruce, was in theSenate. All this tended tomake Washington an attractive place for membersof the coloured race. Then, too, they knew that at all times theycould have the protection ofthe law in the District of Columbia. The public schools in Washington for coloured people were better then than theywere elsewhere. I took great interest in studying the life of our people there closely at that time. I foundthatwhile among them there was a large element ofsubstantial,worthy citizens, there was also a superficiality about the life of a large class thatgreatlyalarmedme. I sawyoungcoloured menwho werenotearning morethan fourdollars a week spend two dollars or more for a buggy on Sunday to ride up and down PennsylvaniaAvenue in, in order that they might try to convince the world that theywereworth thousands. I sawother young menwho received seventy-five or one hundreddollars per month from the Government, who were in debt at the end of every month. I saw men who but a few months previous were members 90 UP FROM SLAVERY ofCongress, thenwithout employment and inpoverty.
