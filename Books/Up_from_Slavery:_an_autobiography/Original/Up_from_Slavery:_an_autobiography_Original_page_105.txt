I have begun everything with the idea that I could succeed, and I never had much patience with the multitudes of people who are always readytoexplainwhyone cannot succeed.
 
 I have always had a high regard forthe manwho could tell me how to succeed. Idetermined to face the situationjust as itwas. Atthe end oftheweek Iwentto the treasurer of the Hampton Institute, General J. F. B. Marshall,and toldhimfrankly my condition. To mygratification he told me that I could reenter the institution, and that he would trustme to paythe debt when I could. During the second year I continued towork as ajanitor.
 
 The education that I received at Hampton out of the text-books was but a small part of what I learned there. One of the things that impressed itself upon me deeply, the second year, was the unselfishnessofthe teachers. It washard for me to understand how any individuals could bring themselves to the pointwhere they couldbe sohappy in working for others. Beforethe end of theyear, I think I began learning that thosewho are happiest are those whodo the most for others. This lesson I have tried to carrywith me ever since.
 
 I also learned avaluable lesson at Hampton by coming into contact with the best breeds of live stock and fowls. No student, I think,who has had HELPING OTHERS 67 the opportunity ofdoing thiscouldgooutinto the worldandcontent himselfwith the poorestgrades.
