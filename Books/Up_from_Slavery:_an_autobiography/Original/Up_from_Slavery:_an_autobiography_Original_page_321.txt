 Each day the school seemed to depend upon me more largely for its daily expenses, and I told these Boston friends that,while I thanked them sincerely for their thoughtfulness and generosity, I could not go to Europe, for the reason that the school could not live financially while I was absent. They then informed me that Mr. Henry L. Higginson, and some other good friendswho I know do not want their names made public,were then raising a sum of money which would be sufficient to keep the school in operationwhile I was away. At this point I was compelled to surrender. Every avenue ofescape hadbeen closed.
 
 Deep down inmyheart thewhole thing seemed more like adream than like reality, and for a long time itwas difficult forme tomake myself believe that I was actuallygoing to Europe. I had been born and largely reared in the lowest depths of slavery, ignorance, and poverty. In my childhood I had suffered forwant of aplace to sleep, for lack of food, clothing, and shelter. I had not had the privilegeofsittingdown toadining-tableuntil I was quite well grown. Luxuries had always seemed to EUROPE 273 me to be somethingmeantfor white people, not for my race.
