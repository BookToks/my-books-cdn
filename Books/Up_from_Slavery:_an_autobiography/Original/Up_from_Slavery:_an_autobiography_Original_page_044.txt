The picture of several dozen boys and girls in a schoolroom engaged instudy made a deep impression upon me, and I had the feeling that to get into a schoolhouse and study in this way would be about the same as getting into paradise.
 
 So far as I can now recall, the first knowledge .
 
 that I got ofthe fact that we were slaves, and that freedom ofthe slaves was beingdiscussed,was early onemorningbefore day,when I was awakened by my mother kneeling over her children and fervently praying that Lincoln and his armies might be successful, and that one day she and her children might be free. In this connection I have never been able to understand how the slaves throughout the South, completely ignorant as were themasses so far as books or newspapers were concerned,were able to keep themselves so accurately and completely informed about the great National questions that were agitating the country. From the time that Garrison, Lovejoy, and others began to agitate for freedom, the slaves throughout the South kept in close touch with the progress of the movement. Though I was a mere child during thepreparation for the Civil War and during the war itself, I now recall the many late-at-night 8 UP FROM SLAVERY whispered discussions that I heard my mother and the other slaves on the plantation indulge in.
