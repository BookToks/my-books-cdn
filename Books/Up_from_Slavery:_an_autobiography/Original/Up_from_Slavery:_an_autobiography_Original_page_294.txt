It has been my privilege to deliver addresses at many of our leading colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Williams, Amherst, Fisk University, the UniversityofPennsylvania, Wellesley, the University of Michigan, Trinity College in North Carolina, and many others.
 
 It has been a matter ofdeep interest to me to notethe number ofpeoplewho havecome to shake hands with me after an address,who say that this is the first time they have ever called a Negro "Mister." When speaking directly in the interests of the Tuskegee Institute, Iusually arrange,some time in advance, a series ofmeetings in importantcentres.
 
 This takes me before churches, Sunday-9chools, Christian Endeavour Societies, and men's and women's clubs. When doing this I sometimes speak before as many as four organizations in a single day.
 
 Threeyears ago, atthe suggestionofMr. Morris K. Jesup, ofNewYork,andDr.J. L. M. Curry, the general agent ofthe fund,the trustees ofthe John F. Slater Fund voted a sum ofmoneytobe used in paying the expenses of Mrs. Washington and myself while holding a series of meetings among the coloured people inthe large centres ofNegro 248 UP FROM SLAVERY population, especially in the large cities of the ex-slaveholding states.
