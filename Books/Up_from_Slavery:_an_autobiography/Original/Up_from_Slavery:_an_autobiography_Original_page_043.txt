The mill was about three miles from the plantation. This work I alwaysdreaded. The heavy bag ofcorn would be thrown across the back ofthehorse, andthe corn divided about evenly on each side; butin some way, almost without exception, on these trips,the corn would so shift as to become unbalanced and would fall off the horse, and often I would fall with it. As I was not strong enough to reload the corn upon the horse, I would have to wait,sometimes for many hours, till achance passer-by came along who would help me out of my trouble. The hours while waiting for some one were usually spent in crying. The time consumedinthis way made me late inreaching the mill, and by the time I got my corn ground and reached home it would befar into the night. The roadwas a lonely one, and often led through dense forests. I was always frightened. The woods weresaid to be full of soldiers who had deserted from the army, and I had been told that the first thing a deserterdid to a Negro boywhen he found him alone was to cut off his ears. Besides, when I was late ingetting home I knew I would always get a severe scolding or a flogging.
 
 I had no schooling whatever while I was a slave, though I remember on several occasions Iwent as A SLAVE AMONG SLAVES 7 1 far as the schoolhouse door with one of myyoung mistresses to carry her books.
