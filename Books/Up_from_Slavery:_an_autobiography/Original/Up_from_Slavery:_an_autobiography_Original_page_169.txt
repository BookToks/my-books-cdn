No single individualdid moretoward laying the foundations of the Tuskegee Institutesoastoinsurethesuccessfulwork thathas been done there than Olivia A. Davidson.
 
 Miss Davidson and Ibegan consulting asto the future of the school from the first. The students were making progress in learning books and in developing their minds; but it became apparent at oncethat, ifwewereto make anypermanentimpression upon thosewho had come to us fortraining, we must do something besides teach them mere books. The students hadcome fromhomes where they had had no opportunities for lessons which would teach them how to care for their bodies.
 
 With few exceptions, the homes in Tuskegee in which the students boarded werebut little improvement upon those from which they had come. We wanted to teach the students howto bathe; how to carefortheirteethandclothing. Wewantedtoteach them what to eat, and howto eat it properly, and how to care for their rooms. Aside from this, we wanted to give them such a practical knowledge ofsome one industry, together withthe spirit of industry, thrift, and economy, thattheywouldbe sure ofknowing how to make a living after they had left Wewantedto teachthem tostudyactualthings us.
 
 instead ofmere books alone.
