It is such a rest and relief to get away from crowds of people, and handshaking, and travelling, and get home, evenifit be for but a very briefwhile.
 
 Another thing at Tuskegee out ofwhich I get a great deal ofpleasure and satisfaction is in the meeting with our students, and teachers, and their families, in thechapel for devotional exercises every evening at half-past eight, the last thing before retiring for the night. It is an inspiring sightwhen one stands on the platform there and sees before him eleven or twelve hundred earnest young men and women; and one cannot but feel that it is a privilege to help to guide them to a higher and more useful life.
 
 In the spring of 1899 there came to mewhat I might describe as almost the greatest surprise of my life. Some good ladies in Boston arranged a public meetingin the interests of Tuskegee, to be held in the Hollis Street Theatre. This meeting was attended bylargenumbersofthe best people of Boston, of both races. Bishop Lawrence presided.
 
 In addition to an address made by myself, Mr.
 
 Paul Lawrence Dunbar read from his poems, and Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois read an original sketch.
 
 Some of those who attendedthis meeting noticed that I seemed unusually tired,and some little time EUROPE 271 after the close ofthe meeting, one ofthe ladies who had been interestedinit asked me in acasual way if I had ever been to Europe.
