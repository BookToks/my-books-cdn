72 UP FROM SLAVERY Once there, I knewthat I could make myself so useful as ajanitorthat I could in some way get through the school year.
 
 Three weeks before the time for the opening of the term at Hampton, I was pleasantlysurprised to receive a letter from mygoodfriend Miss Mary F.
 
 Mackie, the lady principal, asking me to return to Hampton two weeks before the opening of the school, in orderthat I might assist herin cleaning thebuildings andgettingthings inorder for the new school year. Thiswasjusttheopportunity Iwanted.
 
 Itgave me a chance to secure acredit in the treasurer's office. I startedforHampton at once.
 
 During these two weeks I was taught a lesson which I shall never forget. Miss Mackie was a member of one of the oldest and most cultured families of the North, and yet for two weeks she workedby mysidecleaningwindows,dusting rooms, putting beds in order, andwhat not. She felt that thingswould notbe incondition forthe opening of school unless everywindow-panewas perfectly clean, and she took the greatestsatisfaction in helping to clean them herself. The work which I have described she did every year that I was at Hampton.
 
 Itwas hardforme atthis time tounderstand how awoman of hereducation and social standing could take suchdelightinperformingsuchservice,inorder HELPING OTHERS 73 to assist in the elevation of an unfortunate race.
