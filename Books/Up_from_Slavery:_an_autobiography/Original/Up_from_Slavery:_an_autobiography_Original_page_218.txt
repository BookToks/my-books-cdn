Whenwewere through, I decided togetmyselfoutof the embarrassing situation and go into the smoking-room, where most of the menwere by that time, to see howthe land lay. In the meantime, however, it hadbecomeknowninsomewaythroughoutthecar who Iwas. When Iwent into the smoking-room Iwas never more surprised in mylife thanwhen each man, nearlyevery one of them a citizen of Georgia,cameupandintroduced himselfto me and thankedme earnestly for theworkthat Iwas trying todo for the whole South. This was not flattery, because each one ofthese individuals knewthat he hadnothing togainby trying to flatter me.
 
 From the first Ihavesoughtto impress the stu-" dents with theidea thatTuskegee is not my institution, or that ofthe officers, but that it is their institution, andthattheyhave as much interest in it as any of the trustees or instructors. I have further sought tohave them feel that I am at the institution as their friend and adviser, and not as their overseer. It has been myaim to have them speak with directness and frankness about anything that concerns the life ofthe school. Two or three times ayear I ask the students towrite me a letter criticisingormakingcomplaintsorsuggestionsabout anything connected with the institution. When UP FROM SLAVERY 172 this is notdone,I have them meet me inthe chapel for a heart-to-heart talk about the conduct of the school.
