First, always todo my whole duty regarding making our work known to individuals and organizations; and, second, not to worry about the results. This second rule has been thehardest for me to live up to. When bills are on the eve of falling due, with not adollarin hand with which to meet them, it is pretty difficult to learn not to worry, although I think I am learning more and more each yearthat allworry simply consumes, and to no purpose, just so much physical and mental strength that might otherwise be given to effective work. After considerable experience in coming into contact with wealthy and noted men, I have observed that those who have accomplished the greatest results are those who "keep under the body" ; are those who never grow excited or lose self-control, but are always calm, self-possessed, patient, and polite. I think that President William McKinley is thebest example ofaman ofthis class that I have ever seen.
 
 In order to be successful in anykind of undertaking, I think themainthing is for one togrow to the point where he completely forgets himself; that is, to lose himself inagreat cause. In proportion as one loses himselfinthisway, inthesame degree does he get the highest happiness outof his work.
