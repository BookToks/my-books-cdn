CHAPTER IV HELPING OTHERS AT the end ofmy firstyearatHampton Iwas confronted with another difficulty. Most of the studentswent home to spend their vacation. I had no moneywithwhich togohome, but I had togo somewhere. In those days very few students werepermitted to remainatthe school during vacation. It made me feel very sad and homesick to see the other students preparing to leave and starting for home. I not onlyhad no money with which to go home,but I hadnonewith which to go anywhere.
 
 Insome way, however, I had gotten hold of an extra, second-hand coat which I thought was a pretty valuable coat. This I decided to sell, in order to get a little moneyfor travelling expenses.
 
 Ihad agood deal of boyish pride, and I tried to hide, as far as Icould, from the other students the fact that I had no moneyand nowhere to go. I made it known to a few people in the town of Hampton that Ihad this coat to sell, and, after a 63 64 UP FROM SLAVERY gooddeal ofpersuading, onecoloured manpromised to come to my room to look the coat over and consider thematter of buying it.
