When I explained my plan to the young men, I noticed thattheydid not seem to take to it very kindly. Itwas hard for them tosee the connection between clearing land and an education.
 
 Besides, many of them had been school-teachers, and they questioned whether or not clearing land would be in keeping with their dignity. In order to relieve them from any embarrassment, each afternoon after school I took my axe and led the way to the woods. When they sawthat Iwas not afraid or ashamed to work, they began to assistwith more enthusiasm. We kept atthe work each afternoon, until we had cleared about twenty acres and had planted acrop.
 
 In the meantime Miss Davidson was devising plans to repaythe loan. Her first effortwas made by holding festivals, or "suppers." She made a personal canvass among the white and coloured families in the town of Tuskegee, and got them to agree to give something, like a cake, a chicken, bread, or pies, that could be sold at the festival.
 
 Ofcoursethecoloured peoplewereglad togive anything that they could spare, but Iwant to addthat Miss Davidson did not apply to a single white family, so far as I now remember, that failed to donate something; and in many ways the white families showed their interest in the school.
