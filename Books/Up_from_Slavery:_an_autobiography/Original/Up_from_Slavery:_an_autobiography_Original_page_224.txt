CHAPTER XII RAISING MONEY WHEN we opened our boarding department, we provided rooms in the attic of Porter Hall, our first building, for a number of girls. But the number of students, of both sexes, continued to increase. We could find rooms outside the school grounds for many of the young men, but the girls we did not care to expose in this way. Verysoon the problem ofproviding more rooms for the girls, as well as a larger boarding department for all the students, grew serious.
 
 As a result, we finally decided to undertake the construction of a still larger buildingâ€”a building thatwould containrooms forthe girls and boarding accommodations for all.
 
 After having had a preliminary sketch of the neededbuilding made,we found that itwould cost about ten thousand dollars. We had no money whatever with which to begin; still we decided to give the needed building a name. We knew we could name it, even though we were in doubt about 177 178 UP FROM SLAVERY ourability to securethe means for its construction.
