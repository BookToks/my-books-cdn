When persons ask mein these days how, in the midst of what sometimes seem hopelessly discouraging conditions, I can have such faith in the future of my race in this country, I remind them of thewilderness through which and out of which, a good Providence has already led us.
 
 Ever since I have been old enough to think for myself, I have entertained the idea that, notwithstanding the cruel wrongs inflicted upon us, the black man got nearly as much out of slavery as the white man did. The hurtful influences of the institutionwere not by anymeans confined to the Negro. This was fully illustrated by the life upon our own plantation. The whole machinery of slavery was so constructed as to cause labour, as a rule, to be looked upon as a badge of degradation, of inferiority. Hence labour was something that both races on the slave plantation sought to escape.
 
 The slave system on our place, in a large measure, took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of thewhite people. My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever masC 18 UP FROM SLAVERY tered a single trade or special line of productive industry.
