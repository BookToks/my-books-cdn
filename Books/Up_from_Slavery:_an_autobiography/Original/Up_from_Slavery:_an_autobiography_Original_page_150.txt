During thedays ofslavery, and since, the town had been a centre for the education of thewhite people. This was an added advantage, forthe reason thatIfound thewhite people possessing a degreeofcultureandeducation that is not surpassedby many localities. While the coloured people were ignorant, they had not, as a rule, degraded and weakened their bodiesby vices such as are commontothe lower class ofpeople in the large cities. In general, I found the relations between the two races pleasant. For example, the largest, and I think at that time the only hardware store inthe townwas owned and operatedjointly by a coloured man and awhite man. This copartnership continued untilthedeath of thewhite partner.
 
 I found that about a year previous to my going to Tuskegee some of the coloured peoplewho had heard something of the work of education being done at Hampton had applied tothe state Legislature, through theirrepresentatives, forasmallappropriation to be used in starting a normal school in Tuskegee. This request the Legislaturehad compliedwithtotheextentofgranting an annual appropriation of two thousand dollars. I soon learned, however, thatthismoney could be used onlyfor the payment of the salariesof the instructors, and that UP FROM SLAVERY ΙΙΟ therewas no provision for securing land,buildings, or apparatus.
