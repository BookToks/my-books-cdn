 The firstplace Iwentto inthe North,was Northampton, Mass., where I spent nearly a half-day in looking for a coloured family with whom I could board,neverdreamingthatanyhotelwouldadmitme.
 
 Iwas greatly surprised when I found that I would have no trouble inbeing accommodated at a hotel.
 
 Wewere successful ingetting money enough so thaton ThanksgivingDay ofthatyearwe held our first service in the chapel of Porter Hall, although the building was not completed.
 
 In looking about for some one to preach the Thanksgiving sermon, I found one of the rarest men that it has ever been my privilege to know.
 
 This was the Rev. RobertC. Bedford,awhite man from Wisconsin,who was then pastor ofa little coloured Congregational church in Montgomery, Ala.
 
 Before going to Montgomery to lookfor some one to preach this sermon I had never heard of Mr.
 
 Bedford. He had neverheard of me. He gladly consented to come to Tuskegee and hold the Thanksgiving service. It was the first service of the kind that the coloured people there had ever 158 UP FROM SLAVERY observed, and what adeep interest theymanifested in it!
