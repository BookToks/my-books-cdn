In order to help remedy the difficulty, theGeneral conceived the planof putting up tents tobe used as rooms. As soon as itbecame known that General Armstrongwould be pleased ifsome ofthe older students would liveinthe tents during thewinter,nearlyeverystudentin schoolvolunteered togo.
 
 I was one ofthe volunteers. Thewinter that we spent in those tents was anintensely cold one, and we suffered severelyâ€”how much I am sure General Armstrong never knew,because we made no complaints. Itwas enoughfor us toknowthat we were pleasingGeneral Armstrong, and thatwe were making it possible for an additional number of students to secure an education. More than once, during acold night,when a stiffgalewouldbeblowing,ourtentwas liftedbodily,andwewouldfindourselves in the open air. The General would usually pay avisit to the tents early in the morning, and his earnest, cheerful,encouraging voicewoulddispel any feeling ofdespondency.
 
 I have spoken of my admiration for General Armstrong, and yet he was but a type of that Christlike body of men and womenwho went into the Negro schools at the close of the war by the 58 UP FROM SLAVERY hundreds to assistinlifting up my race.
