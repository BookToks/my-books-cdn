This I was very glad to do. I continued working on this vesselfor a number of days. After buying food with the small wages I receivedtherewas not much left toadd to theamountImust get to pay my way to Hampton. Inorder to economizeineveryway possible, soas to be sure to reach Hampton inareasonable time, I continued to sleep under the same sidewalk thatgave me shelter the first night Iwas in Richmond. Many years after thatthe coloured citizens of Richmond very kindly tendered me areception atwhich theremust have been two thousand peoplepresent. This reception was heldnot far from the spot where I slept the first night I spent in that city, and I must confess that my mind was moreupon the sidewalk that first gave me shelter thanuponthereception, agreeable and cordial as it was.
 
 When I had saved what I considered enough money with which to reach Hampton, I thanked the captain of the vessel for his kindness, and started again. Without any unusual occurrence I reached Hampton, with a surplus ofexactly fifty cents with which to begin my education. To me it had been a long, eventful journey; but the first sight ofthe large, three-story,brick school building THE STRUGGLE FOR AN EDUCATION 51 seemed to have rewarded me for all that I had undergone in orderto reach theplace.
