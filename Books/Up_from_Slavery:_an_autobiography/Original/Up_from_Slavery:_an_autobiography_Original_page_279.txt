Very soon public sentiment began making itself felt, indemanding apurifying of the ministry. While this is not yet complete by any means, I think I may say, without egotism, and I have been told by many of our most influential ministers, that mywords hadmuch todowith starting a demand for the placing of a higher type of men in the pulpit.

Myexperiencewiththem, as well as other events in my life,convince me that the thing to do,when onefeels sure thathe has said or done the right thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. Ifhe is right, timewill show it.
