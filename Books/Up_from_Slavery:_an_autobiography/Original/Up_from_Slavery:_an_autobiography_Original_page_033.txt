As theNegrobecomes economically independent, he becomes aresponsible part of the Southern life; and thewhites so recognize him. And this must be so from the nature of things. There is nothing artificial about it. It is development in a perfectly natural way. And the Southern whites not onlyso recognize it, but they are imitating it in the teaching of the neglected masses of their own race. It has thus come about that the school is takingamore direct and helpful hold on life in the South than anywhere else in the country. Education is not a thing apart from life â€”not a "system," nor a philosophy; it is direct teaching how to live and how to work.
 
 To say that Mr. Washington has won the gratitude of all thoughtful Southern white men, is to say that he has worked with the highest practical wisdom at a large constructive task; for no plan for the up-building of the freedman could succeed that ran counter to Southern opinion. To winthe support of Southern opinion and to shape it was a necessary part of the task; and in this he has so well succeeded thatthe South has a sincere and high regard for him. He once said to me that he recalled the day, and remembered it thankfully, when INTRODUCTION xxiii he grew large enough to regard a Southern white manas he regarded a Northern one.
