THE STRUGGLE FOR AN EDUCATION 47 Thedistance from Maldento Hampton is about five hundred miles, I had not been away from homemanyhours before itbegan togrowpainfully evident that Idid not have enough moneyto pay my fare to Hampton. Oneexperience I shall long remember. I hadbeentravellingover the mountains most of the afternoon in an old-fashioned stage-coach, when, late in the evening, the coach stopped for the night at a common, unpainted house called a hotel. All the other passengers except myself were whites. In my ignorance I supposed that the little hotel existed for the purpose ofaccommodating the passengers who travelled on the stage-coach. The difference that the colour of one's skinwould make Ihadnotthought anything about. Afterallthe other passengers had beenshown rooms andweregetting readyfor supper, I shyly presented myself before the man at thedesk. It istrue Ihad practically no money in my pocket with which to pay for bedor food, but I hadhoped in some way to beg my way into the goodgraces ofthe landlord, for at that season in themountains ofVirginia theweatherwas cold, and Iwanted to get indoors for the night. Without askingas towhether I had anymoney,the man at thedesk firmly refusedtoevenconsiderthe matter ofproviding me with food or lodging. This was 48 UP FROM SLAVERY my first experience in findingoutwhatthe colour of my skinmeant.
