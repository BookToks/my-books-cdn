Like the " patrollers"the "Ku Klux" operated almostwholly atnight. Theywere, however, more cruel than the "patrollers." Their objects,in the main, were to crush out the political aspirations of the Negroes, but they did not confine themselves to this, because schoolhouses as well as churches were burned by them, and many innocent persons were made to suffer. During this period hot a few coloured people lost their lives.
 
 As ayoung man, the acts of these lawless bands made a great impressionuponme. I saw one open battle take place at Malden between some of the coloured and white people. There must have been not far from a hundred persons engaged on each side; many on both sides were seriously injured, among them beingGeneral Lewis Ruffner, the husband of my friend Mrs. Viola Ruffner. General Ruffner tried to defend the coloured people,and for this hewasknocked down and so seriouslywounded thathe never completely recovered. It seemed to me as I watched this struggle between members of the two races,that therewas no hope for our people in this country. The " Ku Klux" period was, I think, the darkest part ofthe Reconstructiondays.
 
 I have referred to this unpleasant part ofthe his HELPING OTHERS 79 tory of the South simply for the purpose of calling attention to the great change that has taken place since the days of the " Ku Klux.
