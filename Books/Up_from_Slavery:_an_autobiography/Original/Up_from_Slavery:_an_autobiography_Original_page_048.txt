A SLAVE AMONG SLAVES II The firstpair ofshoes that I recallwearingwere wooden ones. They hadrough leather on the top, but the bottoms, which were about an inch thick, were ofwood. When Iwalked theymadeafearful noise, and besidesthis theywere very inconvenient, since therewas no yielding to the natural pressure of the foot. In wearing them one presented an exceedingly awkward appearance. The mosttrying ordeal that I was forced to endure as a slave boy, however, was the wearing ofa flax shirt. In the portion of Virginia where I lived it was common to use flax as part ofthe clothing for the slaves.
 
 That part of the flaxfromwhich our clothingwas made was largely the refuse, which ofcourse was the cheapest and roughest part. I can scarcely imagine any torture, except, perhaps, thepulling of atooth, that is equal to that caused byputting on a new flax shirt for the first time. It is almost equal to the feeling that one would experience if hehadadozen ormore chestnutburrs,orahundred small pin-points, in contact with his flesh. Even to this dayI canrecall accuratelythe tortures that I underwentwhenputting on one of these garments.
 
 Thefact that my flesh was soft and tender added to the pain. ButI had no choice. Ihadtowear the flax shirt or none; and had it been left to me to choose, I shouldhave chosen to wear no covering.
