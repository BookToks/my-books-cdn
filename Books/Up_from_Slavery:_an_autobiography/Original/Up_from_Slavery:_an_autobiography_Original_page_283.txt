I do notbelievethat the Negro should cease voting, for a man cannot learn the exercise of self-government by ceasing to vote, any more than aboycan learn to swim bykeeping out of the water, but I do believe that in his voting he should more and more be influenced by those of intelligence and character who are his next-door neighbours.
 
 Iknowcoloured menwho, through the encouragement, help, and advice ofSouthernwhite people, have accumulated thousands of dollars' worth of property, butwho, at the same time,would never think of going to those same persons for advice concerning the casting of their ballots. This, it seems to me, is unwise and unreasonable, and should cease. In saying this I do not mean that the Negro should truckle, or not vote from principle, for theinstanthe ceases to vote from principle he loses the confidence and respect of the Southern white man even.
 
 I do not believe that any state should make a law that permits an ignorant and poverty-stricken whiteman to vote, and prevents a black man inthe same condition from voting. Such a law is not onlyunjust, but itwill react, as all unjust laws do, in time; for the effect of such a law is to encourage THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION ADDRESS 237 theNegro to secure education and property, and at the same time it encourages thewhite man to remain in ignorance and poverty.
