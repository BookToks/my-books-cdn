Themore we talked with the students, who were then coming tous from several parts of the state, the morewe found that thechief ambition among a large proportion of themwas toget an education so that they would not have to work any longer with their hands.
 
 This is illustrated by a story told of a coloured man in Alabama, who,one hot day in July, while hewas atwork in acotton-field, suddenly stopped, and, looking toward the skies,said: "O Lawd, de cotton am sograssy, de work am so hard, and the sun am so hot dat I b'lieve dis darky am called topreach!" About three months after the opening of the school, and at the timewhenwe were in the greatest anxiety about our work, there came into the market for sale an old and abandoned plantation which was situated about a mile from the town of or "big house," Tuskegee. The mansion house as it would have been calledâ€”which had been occupied by the owners during slavery, had been burned. Aftermaking a careful examination ofthis TEACHING SCHOOL 129 place,itseemedtobejustthelocationthatwewanted in order to make our work effective and permanent.
