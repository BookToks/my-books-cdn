I was also the principal speaker at the Commencement exercises of the Royal College for the Blind. These exercises were held in the Crystal Palace, and the presiding officer was the late Duke of Westminster, who was said to be, I believe,the richest man in England, if not in the world. The Duke, as well as his wife and their daughter, seemed to be pleased with what I said, and thanked me heartily.
 
 Through the kindness of LadyAberdeen, my wife and I were enabled to go with a party of those who were attending the International Congress of Women, then in session in London, to see Queen Victoria, at Windsor Castle, where, afterward, we were all the guests of her Majesty at tea. In our party was Miss Susan B. Anthony, and I was deeply impressed with the fact that one did not often get an opportunity to see, during the same hour, two women so remarkable in different ways as Susan B. Anthony and Queen Victoria.
 
 In the House of Commons, which we visited several times, we met Sir Henry M. Stanley. I talkedwith him aboutAfrica and its relation to the American Negro, and after my interviewwith him Ibecame more convinced than everthatthere was no hope of the American Negro's improving his conditionby emigrating toAfrica.
