In our industrial teachingwe keep three things in mind: first, that the student shall be so educated that he shall be enabled to meet conditions as they exist now, in the part ofthe Southwhere he lives— in a word, to be able to do the thing which the world wants done; second,that every student who graduates from the school shall have enough skill, coupled with intelligence and moral character, to enable him to make aliving for himselfand others ; third, to send everygraduate outfeeling and knowing that labourisdignifiedandbeautiful—to make each one love labour insteadoftrying to escape it.
 
 In addition to the agricultural training which we give to young men,and the traininggiven to our girls in all the usual domestic employments,we now train a number of girls in agriculture each year.
 
 These girls are taught gardening, fruit-growing, dairying, bee-culture, and poultry-raising.
 
 While the institution is in no sense denominational, we have adepartment known as the Phelps Hall Bible Training School, inwhich a number of students are prepared for the ministry and other forms of Christian work, especially work in the country districts. What is equally important, each oneofthese studentsworks halfofeachdayat some gnihniptoayasrsnrgeneotidhrcntuen.
