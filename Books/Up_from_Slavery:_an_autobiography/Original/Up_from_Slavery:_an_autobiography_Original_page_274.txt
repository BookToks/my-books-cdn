Some days after its delivery I senta copy of my address to the President of the United States, the Hon. Grover Cleveland. I received from him the following autograph reply: GRAYGABLES, BUZZARD'SBAY, Mass., October6, 1895.
 
 BookerT. Washington, Esq. : My Dear Sir: I thankyou forsending me a copy of your address delivered at the Atlanta Exposition.
 
 Ithank you with much enthusiasm formaking the address. I have read it with intense interest, and I think theExpositionwouldbefullyjustified ifitdidnotdomore than furnishtheopportunityfor its delivery. Your words cannot fail todelight and encourage allwho wish well for your race; and ifourcoloured fellow-citizensdo not from your utterancesgather new hope and form new determinations togaineveryvaluable advantage offeredthembytheir citizenship, it willbe strangeindeed.
 
 Yours verytruly, Grover Cleveland.
 
 Later I met Mr. Cleveland, for the first time, when, as President,he visited the Atlanta Exposition. At the request ofmyselfand others he consented to spendan hour in the Negro Building, for the purpose of inspecting theNegro exhibit and of 228 UP FROM SLAVERY giving the coloured people in attendance an opportunity to shake hands with him.
