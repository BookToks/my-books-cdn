 More than once I have found myself in some pretty tight places while collecting money in the North. The following incident I have never relatedbut once before, for the reason that I feared thatpeoplewould not believe it. One morning I foundmyselfin Providence,Rhode Island, without a cent ofmoney with which to buy breakfast. In crossing the street to see a lady from whom I hoped to get some money, I found a bright new twenty-five-cent piece in the middle ofthe streetcar track. I not only had this twenty-five cents for my breakfast, butwithin afewminutes I had a donation from the lady onwhom I had started to call.
 
 At one of our Commencements I was bold enough to invite the Rev. E. Winchester Donald, D.D., rector of Trinity Church, Boston, to preach the Commencement sermon. As we then had no 190 UP FROM SLAVERY room largeenough to accommodate all who would be present, theplaceofmeetingwas under a large, improvised arbour, built partly ofbrush andpartly ofroughboards.
