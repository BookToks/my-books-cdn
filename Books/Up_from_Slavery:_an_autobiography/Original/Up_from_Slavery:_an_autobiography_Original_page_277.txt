For awhile there was a reaction, so far as acertain element ofmy own race was concerned, but later these reactionary ones seemed to have beenwon over to myway of believing and acting.
 
 While speakingofchanges inpublicsentiment, I recall that aboutten yearsafterthe schoolat Tuskegee was established, I had an experience that I shall never forget. Dr. Lyman Abbott, then the pastor ofPlymouth Church, and also editorofthe Outlook (then the Christian Union), asked metowrite a letter for his paper giving my opinion of the exact condition, mentalandmoral, ofthe colouredministers in the South, as based upon myobservations.
 
 I wrote the letter,givingthe exact facts as I conceived them to be. The picture painted was a rather black oneâ€”or, since I am black, shall I say "white" ? It could not be otherwise with a race buta fewyears out of slavery, aracewhichhad not had time or opportunity to produce a competent ministry.
 
 What I said soon reached everyNegro minister in the country, I think, and the letters ofcondemnation which I received from them were not few.
