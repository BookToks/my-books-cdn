Dear Mr. Washington: Would it be agreeable to youtobeoneoftheJudges ofAward in the Department ofEducationatAtlanta? If so, Ishall be glad to place your name upon the list. A line by telegraph will be welcomed.
 
 Yours very truly, D. C. GILMAN.
 
 I think I was evenmore surprisedto receive this invitation than I hadbeen to receive the invitation to speak at the opening of the Exposition. It was to be a part of my duty, as one of the jurors, to pass not only upon the exhibits of the coloured schools, but also upon those of the white schools.
 
 I accepted the position, and spent a month in Atlanta in performance of the duties which it entailed. The board ofjurors was a large one, consisting in all of sixty members. It was about equally divided between Southern white people and Northern white people. Among them were college presidents, leading scientists and men of letters, and specialists in many subjects. When the group of jurors to which I was assigned met for organization, Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, who 234 UP FROM SLAVERY was one of the number, moved that I be made secretary of that division, and the motion was unanimously adopted.
