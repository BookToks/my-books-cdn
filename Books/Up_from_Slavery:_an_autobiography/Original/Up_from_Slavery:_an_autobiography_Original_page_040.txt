 The cabinwas not onlyour living-place, but was also used as the kitchen for the plantation. My mother was the plantation cook. The cabin was without glass windows ; it had only openings in the sidewhich let in the light, and also the cold, chilly air of winter. There was a door to the cabin that is, something that was called a doorâ€”but the uncertain hinges by which it was hung, and the large cracks in it, tosay nothing ofthe fact that it was too small, made the room a very uncomfortable one. In additionto these openingstherewas,inthe lower right-hand cornerofthe room, the "cat-hole," a contrivance which almost every mansion or cabin inVirginia possessed during the ante-bellum period. The "cat-hole" was a square opening, about seven by eight inches, provided for the purpose of lettingthe cat pass in and outof the house at will during the night. In the case of our particular cabin I could never understand the necessity for this convenience, since there were at least ahalfdozen other places in the cabin that would have accommodated thecats. Therewas no wooden floor in our cabin, the naked earth being used as a floor.
