Washington, Principal of an industrialschool for coloured people in Tuskegee,Ala stood on the platform of the Auditorium, with the sun shining over the heads of his auditors into his eyes,and withhis whole facelit upwiththe fire of prophecy, Clark Howell,the successorof HenryGrady,saidto me, "That man's speech is the beginning of a moral revolution in America." Itis the firsttime that aNegro has made a speech in the South on any important occasionbefore an audience composed of white men and women. It electrified the audience, andthe responsewasas if ithad come from the throat ofa whirlwind.

Washington, President of the Tuskegee (Alabama)Normal and Industrial Institute,who mustrank from this time forth as the foremost man ofhis race in America. Gilmore's Band played the "Star-Spangled Banner," and the audience cheered. The tune changed to "Dixie" andthe audience roaredwithshrill "hi-yis." Againthemusic changed,this time to "Yankee Doodle," andthe clamourlessened.

As ProfessorWashington strode to the edge of the stage,the low,descending sun shot fiery rays through the windows into his face. Agreat shoutgreeted him.

Then he turned his 240 UP FROM SLAVERY wonderful countenance to the sunwithouta blink of the eyelids, andbeganto talk.
