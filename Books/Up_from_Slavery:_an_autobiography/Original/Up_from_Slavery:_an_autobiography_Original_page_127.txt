K. Bruce, Governor Pinchback, and many others, were strong, upright, useful men.
 
 Neitherwere all the classdesignated as carpetbaggers dishonourable men. Some of them, like exGovernor Bullock, ofGeorgia, were men of high character and usefulness.
 
 Ofcourse the coloured people, so largelywithout education, and whollywithoutexperiencein government, made tremendous mistakes,just as anypeople similarly situated would have done. Many of the Southern whites have a feeling that, if the Negro is permitted to exercise his political rights now to anydegree,the mistakes of the Reconstructionperiodwillrepeat themselves. I do notthink this would be true,because the Negro is a much stronger and wiser man than he was thirty-five years ago, and he is fast learning the lessonthat he cannotaffordto act in a manner thatwill alienate his Southern white neighbours from him. More and more I am convincedthatthefinal solution of the political end of our race problem will be for each state that finds it necessaryto change the law bearinguponthe franchise to make the law apply with absolute honesty, and without opportunity for double dealing or evasion, to both races alike. Any other course my daily observation in the South convinces me,will be unjust to the Negro,unjust THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD 87 to the white man, and unfair to the rest of the states in the Union,andwill be,like slavery, a sin thatatsometime we shallhavetopayfor.
