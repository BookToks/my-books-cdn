THE SUCCESS IN PUBLIC SPEAKING 265 afternoons, into thewoods,where we can live for a while near the heart of nature, where no one can disturb or vexus, surroundedbypure air, the trees, the shrubbery, the flowers, and the sweet fragrance that springs from a hundred plants, enjoying the chirp of the crickets and the songs of the birds.
 
 This is solid rest.
 
 My garden, also, what little time I can be at Tuskegee, is another source of restand enjoyment.
 
 Somehow I like,as often as possible, to touch nature, not something that is artificial or an imitation, but the real thing. When I can leavemy office in time so that I can spend thirty or forty minutes in spading the ground, in planting seeds, in digging about the plants, I feel that I am coming into contactwith something that is giving me strength for the manyduties and hard places that await me out in the big world. I pitythe man or woman who has never learnedtoenjoynatureand to getstrength andinspiration out of it.
 
 Aside from the large number of fowls and animals kept by the school,I keep individuallya number of pigs and fowls of the best grades, and in raising these I take a great deal of pleasure. I think the pig is my favourite animal. Few things aremore satisfactory tome than ahigh-grade Berkshire or Poland China pig.
