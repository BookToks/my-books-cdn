I found thatthis man had made a contractwith his master, two or three years previous to the Emancipation Proclamation, to the effect that the slave was to be permittedtobuy himself, bypayingso much peryear for his body; andwhile he was paying for himself, hewas to be permitted to labourwhere andforwhom hepleased. Finding thathe could secure better wages in Ohio, he went there. When freedom came, hewas still in debt to his master some three hundred dollars. Notwithstanding that the Emancipation Proclamation freed him from any obligation to his master,this black man walkedthegreaterportion ofthe distanceback towhere his old master livedin Virginia,andplaced the last dollar, with interest, inhishands. In talking to me about this, the man told me that he knewthat he did not have to pay the debt, but that he had given his word to his master, and his wordhehad never broken. He felt that he could not enjoy his freedom till he had fulfilled his promise.
 
 From some things that I have said one may get theidea that some of the slaves did notwant freedom. This is not true. I have never seen one who did not want to be free, or one who would return to slavery.
