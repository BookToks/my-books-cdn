182 UP FROM SLAVERY My experience in getting money for Tuskegee has taughtme to have no patiencewith those people who are always condemning the rich because they are rich, and because they do not give more toobjects ofcharity. In the firstplace,thosewho areguilty of such sweeping criticisms do not know how many people would be made poor, and how much suffering would result, ifwealthypeople were to part all at once with any large proportion of their wealth in a way to disorganize and cripple great business enterprises. Then very few persons have anyidea ofthe large number of applications for helpthat richpeopleareconstantlybeingflooded with. I knowwealthy peoplewho receive as many as twenty calls a day for help. More than once, when I have gone into the offices ofrich men, I have found half a dozen persons waiting to see them, and all come for the same purpose, that of securing money. And all these calls inperson, to say nothing of the applications received through the mails. Very few people have any idea of the amount of money given away by persons who never permit their names to be known. I have often heard persons condemned for not giving away money, who, to my own knowledge, were giving away thousands of dollars every year so quietly that the world knew nothing about it.
