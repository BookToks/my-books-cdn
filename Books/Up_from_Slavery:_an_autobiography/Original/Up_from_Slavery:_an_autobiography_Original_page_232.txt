My experience in securing money convinces me that the first type of man isgrowing more rare all the time, andthat the latter type is increasing; that is, that, more and more, rich people are coming to regard men and women who apply to them for help forworthy objects, not as beggars, but as agents fordoing their work.
 
 In the city of Boston I have rarelycalled upon an individual for funds that I have notbeenthanked for calling, usually before I could get an opportunity to thank the donor for the money. In that city the donors seem to feel, in alarge degree, that an honour is being conferred upon them in their being permitted togive. Nowhere else have I met with, in so large ameasure,this fine and Christlike spirit as in the city of Boston,although there are many notable instances of it outside that city. I repeat my belief that the world is growing in the direction ofgiving. I repeat that the main rule by which I have been guided in collecting money is to do my full duty inregard togiving people who havemoney an opportunity to help.
