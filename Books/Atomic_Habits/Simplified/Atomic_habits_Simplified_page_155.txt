Tracking habits means you have to do two things: practice the habit you want to build and also keep track of it. Counting calories can feel annoying when you’re already trying to stick to a diet. Writing down every sales call can seem boring when you have other work to do. It’s easier to think, “I’ll just eat less,” or “I’ll try harder,” or “I’ll remember to do it.” People often say things like, “I have a decision journal, but I wish I used it more,” or “I tracked my workouts for a week, then stopped.” I’ve felt the same way. I once tried to keep a food log to count calories, but I only did it for one meal before quitting.

Tracking isn’t for everyone, and you don’t have to track everything in your life.

But almost anyone can get some benefit from tracking, even if it’s just for a little while.

So, how can we make tracking easier?

First, try to automate tracking whenever you can. You might be surprised by how much you already track without realizing it. Your credit card shows how often you eat out. Your Fitbit counts your steps and sleep. Your calendar keeps track of new places you visit. Once you know where to find this info, put a reminder in your calendar to check it weekly or monthly instead of every day.

Second, only track your most important habits by hand. It’s better to track one habit all the time than to track ten habits only sometimes.

Finally, write down each habit right after you do it. Finishing the habit should remind you to record it. This way, you can use something called habit stacking, like in Chapter 5, with habit tracking.

The habit stacking + habit tracking idea is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].

For example: After I hang up from a sales call, I will move a paper clip.

After I finish a gym set, I will write it in my workout journal.

After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I ate.

These tricks can help make tracking your habits easier. Even if you don’t like writing things down, tracking for a few weeks can teach you a lot. It’s always cool to see what you’ve actually been doing.
