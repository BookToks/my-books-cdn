Scientists can tell exactly when a craving happens by measuring a chemical in the brain called dopamine. Dopamine became important in 1954 when scientists James Olds and Peter Milner did an experiment that showed how craving and desire work in the brain.

They put tiny wires in the brains of rats and stopped dopamine from being released. Surprisingly, the rats lost all interest in living. They didn’t eat, have sex, or want anything. After a few days, they died from thirst.

In later tests, other scientists blocked dopamine again but gave the rats small drops of sugar. The rats smiled from enjoying the sugar, even though dopamine was blocked. They liked the sugar but didn’t want it anymore. So, they could feel pleasure, but without dopamine, their desire disappeared. And when there’s no desire, nothing happens.

Then, other researchers did the opposite and gave the brain lots of dopamine. The animals started doing habits super fast. In one test, mice got a big dopamine hit every time they poked their nose into a box. Soon, they poked their noses 800 times per hour! Humans are kind of like that too: for example, slot machine players spin the wheel 600 times per hour. Habits happen because of dopamine. Things like taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, or using social media all cause dopamine to rise. Even basic habits like eating, drinking, having sex, and socializing are linked to dopamine.

For a long time, scientists thought dopamine was just about feeling pleasure. Now we know it’s also important for things like motivation, learning, memory, punishment, and moving on purpose.

When it comes to habits, the main point is this: dopamine is released not only when you feel pleasure but also when you expect it. For example, gambling addicts get a dopamine rush before they place a bet, not after winning.

Cocaine addicts get a dopamine boost just by seeing the drug, not after using it. Whenever you think something will be rewarding, your dopamine goes up before it happens. And when dopamine goes up, your motivation to do something goes up too.

It’s the hope of a reward—not actually getting it—that makes us take action.
