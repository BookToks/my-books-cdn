It’s okay if you want to feel less anxious or make double your salary. Start with what you want and then think backward about the kind of person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “What kind of person could get what I want?” Who could lose forty pounds? Who could learn a new language? Who could run a successful start-up?

For example, “Who is the kind of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is steady and reliable. So now, instead of just focusing on writing a book, you focus on being the kind of person who is steady and reliable.

This way of thinking can lead to beliefs like: “I’m the kind of teacher who supports her students.” “I’m the kind of doctor who spends time and cares about each patient.” “I’m the kind of manager who stands up for her employees.” Once you know the kind of person you want to be, you can start doing small things that match that identity. I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person do?” All day, she would ask herself questions like, Would a healthy person walk or take a taxi? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She realized that if she kept acting like a healthy person, she would eventually become one. And she was right.

The idea of identity-based habits is the first step to understanding another important idea: feedback loops. Your habits shape who you are, and who you are shapes your habits. It goes both ways. All habits form through feedback loops (which we will talk about more in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your values and identity control this loop, not just your results. The goal should always be to become the kind of person you want to be, not just to get a certain result.

THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER  
Changing who you are is the main goal of changing your habits. The rest of this book will show you step-by-step how to build better habits for yourself, your family, your team, your company, or anywhere else you want.
