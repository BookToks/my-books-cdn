The discovery of variable rewards happened by accident. One day in the lab, the famous Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner was running low on food pellets during an experiment. Making more pellets took a long time because he had to press them by hand in a machine. This made him wonder why he had to give a treat every single time the rats pressed the lever. 

So, he decided to only give treats sometimes. To his surprise, giving food this way didn't make the rats press less. In fact, it made them press the lever even more.

I made a template for people who want to keep a decision journal. You can find it as part of the habit journal at atomichabits.com/journal.
