Chapter Summary: The opposite of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is to make habits unattractive.

Every behavior has a surface craving and a deeper reason behind it.

Your habits are like modern answers to old, basic desires.

Habits happen because of a prediction your brain makes before you act.

This prediction causes a feeling.

Focus on the good things that happen when you avoid a bad habit to make it seem less appealing.

Habits feel good when we link them to positive feelings, and they feel bad when linked to negative feelings.

Make a motivation ritual by doing something fun right before a hard habit.
