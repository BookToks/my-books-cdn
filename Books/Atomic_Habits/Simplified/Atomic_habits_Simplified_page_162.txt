Wearing a seat belt is required by law in forty-nine out of fifty states. Not only that, but the number of people actually wearing seat belts has changed a lot. In 2016, more than 88% of Americans always buckled up when they got in a car. In just over thirty years, millions of people completely changed their habits.

Laws and rules show how the government can change what we do by creating a social contract. This means that as a group, we all agree to follow certain rules and make sure everyone does. When a new law changes how people act—like seat belt laws, banning smoking in restaurants, or making recycling mandatory—it’s an example of a social contract shaping our habits. The group agrees to behave a certain way, and if you don’t follow, you get punished.

Just like governments use laws to keep people responsible, you can make a habit contract to keep yourself responsible. A habit contract is a spoken or written promise where you say you’ll stick to a certain habit and explain the punishment if you don’t. Then, you find one or two people to be your accountability partners and have them sign the contract with you.

Bryan Harris, a businessman from Nashville, Tennessee, was the first person I saw use this idea. After his son was born, Bryan wanted to lose some weight. He made a habit contract with his wife and personal trainer. The first part said, “Bryan’s main goal for the first three months of 2017 is to start eating right again so he feels better, looks better, and reaches his long-term goal of weighing 200 pounds with 10% body fat.” Under that, he wrote a plan to reach his goal:

Phase #1: Follow a strict “slow-carb” diet in the first three months.

Phase #2: Start tracking macronutrients (like protein, fat, and carbs) strictly in the next three months.

Phase #3: Fine-tune and keep up his diet and workout plan in the last three months.

Finally, he listed the daily habits that would help him reach his goal.

For example, “Write down all the food he eats each day and weigh himself every day.” Then he wrote the punishment if he didn’t do these: “If Bryan doesn’t do these two things, he will have to dress up...”
