Having a clean mouth feels great. Ads told people to “Refresh Your Taste.” Yummy flavors and the fresh feeling made using the product enjoyable right away. Because of this, lots more people started buying it, and Wrigley became the biggest chewing gum company in the world.

Toothpaste followed a similar path. Companies became really successful when they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon. These flavors don’t make the toothpaste work better, but they give you a fresh mouth feeling and make brushing more fun. For example, my wife stopped using Sensodyne because she didn’t like the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor that she liked more.

If something doesn’t feel good, we usually don’t want to do it again. I read about a woman who had a selfish relative who annoyed her. To avoid spending time with him, she acted really boring whenever he was around.

After a few times, he started avoiding her because she was so uninteresting.

Stories like this show a big rule about changing behavior: What you get rewarded for, you do again. What you get punished for, you avoid. You learn what to do based on what felt good or bad before. Good feelings help build habits. Bad feelings stop them.

The first three rules of changing behavior are: make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy. These rules help make sure you actually do the behavior now.

The fourth rule is: make it satisfying. This helps make sure you do the behavior again later. It finishes the habit loop.

But here’s the catch. We don’t want just any kind of satisfaction. We want satisfaction right away.

Think about animals like giraffes, elephants, or lions living in Africa. Every day, they make decisions that have quick results.

They always think about what to eat, where to sleep, or how to stay safe. They live in what scientists call an “immediate-return environment” because their actions bring fast and clear results.

Now think about yourself, a human in today’s world. Many of your choices...
