A greylag goose was following a natural rule: When it sees a round object nearby, it tries to roll it back into its nest. The bigger the round object, the harder it tries to get it.

It’s like each animal’s brain has built-in rules for how to act, and when it sees an extreme example of that rule, it reacts really strongly. Scientists call these extreme triggers supernormal stimuli.

A supernormal stimulus is a stronger version of something real—like a beak with three red dots or an egg as big as a volleyball—and it makes the animal respond more than usual.

People also fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food, for example, makes our brain’s reward system go wild. After hundreds of thousands of years of hunting and gathering, our brains learned to really want salt, sugar, and fat. These foods have a lot of calories and used to be rare when our ancient ancestors lived in the wild. When you don’t know when you’ll eat next, eating as much as possible is a smart survival move.

But today, food is everywhere. Even though we have plenty to eat, our brains still want salt, sugar, and fat like they’re rare. This craving isn’t good for our health, but it keeps happening because our brain hasn’t changed much in about fifty thousand years. The modern food industry takes advantage of these old instincts and makes them work even more.

One big goal of food science is to make products that people really want to eat. Almost every packaged food has been improved somehow, even if it’s just by adding extra flavor. Companies spend tons of money figuring out the perfect crunch in a potato chip or the right amount of fizz in a soda. They even have whole teams working on how food feels in your mouth, which is called orosensation. For example, French fries are golden and crunchy outside but soft and smooth inside.

Some processed foods mix different textures, which is called dynamic contrast. This means foods have more than one feeling—like crunchy and creamy together. Think of melted cheese on crispy pizza or an Oreo cookie’s crunchy outside with its smooth filling. Natural foods usually have the same texture every bite—like eating kale again and again. After a while, your brain gets bored and you feel full. But foods with dynamic contrast stay interesting, so you want to keep eating.

In the end, these tricks help food scientists find the perfect "bliss point" that makes food super enjoyable.
