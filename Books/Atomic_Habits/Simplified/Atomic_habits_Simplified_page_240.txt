The words unconscious, nonconscious, and subconscious all mean not being aware or not thinking about something. Even experts often use these words in the same way without worrying too much about the differences.

I will use the word nonconscious because it covers both the parts of your mind you can never be aware of and the times when you just aren’t paying attention to what’s around you.

Nonconscious means anything you are not actively thinking about.

Some parts of who you are, like being tall or short, usually don’t change much over time. But how you feel about these traits—whether you see them as good or bad—depends on your life experiences.
