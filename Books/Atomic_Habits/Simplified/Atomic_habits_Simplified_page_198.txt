Little Lessons from the Four Laws

I have explained a four-step model for how people behave: cue, craving, response, reward. This idea helps us learn how to build new habits and also shows some cool facts about how people act.

Problem phase: 1. Cue 2. Craving  
Solution phase: 3. Response 4. Reward  

Here, I share some lessons (and some common sense) proven by this model. These examples show how useful this idea is for understanding human behavior. Once you get the model, you’ll notice it everywhere.

First, you have to be aware before you want something. A craving starts when you give meaning to a cue. Your brain creates a feeling to explain what’s happening, so craving only happens after you notice a chance for something.

Happiness means not wanting anything. When you see a cue but don’t want to change how you feel, you are happy with things as they are.

Happiness isn’t about getting pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about not having any desire. It comes when you don’t want to feel different.

Happiness is the state you are in when you don’t want to change how you feel.

But happiness doesn’t last long because new desires always come up. As Caed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Similarly, suffering is the time between wanting a change and actually getting it.

We chase the idea of pleasure. We look for the picture of pleasure we make in our minds. When we act, we don’t really know what it will be.
