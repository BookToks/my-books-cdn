FIGURE 11: At the start (point A), doing a new habit takes a lot of effort and focus. After doing it a few times (point B), it becomes easier but you still have to pay attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit feels more automatic and you don’t have to think much about it.  

Once you pass this point—the habit line—you can do the habit almost without thinking.  

This means a new habit has been made.  

On the next page, you’ll see what happens when scientists watch how automatic a real habit, like walking for ten minutes every day, becomes.  

The shape of these charts, called learning curves, shows something important about changing behavior: habits form because you do them often, not just because time passes.
