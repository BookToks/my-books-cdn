Everyone has their own special strength. Even if you’re not naturally the best, you can still win by being great at one specific thing.

Boiling water makes a potato soft but makes an egg hard. You can’t choose if you’re like a potato or an egg, but you can choose to play a game where being soft or hard is better. If you find a better situation, you can turn things from being against you to working in your favor.

HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES Our genes don’t mean you don’t have to work hard. Instead, they show you what to work hard at. When you know your strengths, you know where to spend your time and energy. You will know what chances to take and what challenges to avoid. The better you understand yourself, the better your plan can be.

Biological differences matter. But it’s more helpful to focus on reaching your own potential than comparing yourself to others. Just because you have limits doesn’t mean you aren’t doing your best.

People often get so focused on their limits that they don’t try hard enough to get close to them.

Also, genes can’t make you successful if you don’t put in the work.

Sure, the fit trainer at the gym might have better genes, but if you haven’t worked out as much, you can’t say if your genes are better or worse. Until you work as hard as the people you admire, don’t say their success is just luck.

In short, one of the best ways to keep your habits enjoyable is to choose things that fit your personality and skills.

Work hard on the things that come easy to you.
