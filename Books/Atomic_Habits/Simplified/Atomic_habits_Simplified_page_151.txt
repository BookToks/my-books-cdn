Chapter Summary The 4th Law of Behavior Change is to make it satisfying.

We are more likely to do something again if it feels good or rewarding.

Our brains are wired to like rewards that happen right away more than ones that come later.

The most important rule of behavior change is: if something is rewarded right away, we do it again. If it’s punished right away, we avoid it.

To make a habit stick, you need to feel like you succeeded right away—even if it’s just a little bit.

The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—help you do the behavior this time. The fourth law—make it satisfying—helps you want to do it again next time.
