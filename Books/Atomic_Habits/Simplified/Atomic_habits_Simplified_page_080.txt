When you feel bad, you might eat junk food to feel better. But eating junk food just makes you feel worse. Watching TV can make you feel tired, so you watch even more because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you nervous, so you might smoke to calm down. But smoking makes your health worse, and then you feel even more nervous. It’s like a bad cycle that keeps going down.

Scientists call this “cue-induced wanting.” It means that something outside, like a picture or a smell, can make you want to do a bad habit again and again. This happens all the time, even when you don’t realize it. For example, addicts see a picture of cocaine for just a tiny moment, less than a blink, and their brain starts wanting the drug even if they don’t know what they saw.

Here’s the important part: you can stop a habit, but you probably won’t forget it.

Once a habit is stuck in your brain, it’s really hard to completely get rid of it, even if you don’t do it for a long time.

That means just trying to resist temptation doesn’t really work well. It’s hard to stay calm and focused when life keeps distracting you. At first, you might beat temptation, but over time, your surroundings shape what you do. Honestly, I’ve never seen someone keep good habits if their environment is negative.

A better way is to stop bad habits before they start. One smart trick is to avoid the things that trigger your bad habits.

If you can’t get work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours.

If you often feel jealous or not good enough, unfollow social media accounts that make you feel that way.

If you watch too much TV, move the TV out of your bedroom.

If you spend too much money on gadgets, stop reading reviews about new tech stuff.

If you play too many video games, unplug your console and hide it in a closet after you’re done.
