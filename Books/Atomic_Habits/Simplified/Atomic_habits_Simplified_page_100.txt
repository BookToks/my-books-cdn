Changing your habits can be hard if it means going against your group. But if changing helps you fit in with your group, it feels much better.

3. Copying the Powerful

People all over want power, respect, and to be seen as important. We want cool badges or fancy titles. We want people to notice us and say good things about us. This might seem like showing off, but it actually makes sense. In the past, people with more power had more resources, less to worry about, and were more likely to find a good partner.

We like doing things that make others respect and admire us. We want to be the person at the gym who can do tough moves, the musician who plays hard songs, or the parent with kids who do great things. These things make us different from everyone else. After we fit in, we try to stand out.

This is why we care so much about how successful people act. We copy their habits because we want to be successful too. Many of the things we do every day come from copying people we look up to.

You copy how the best companies sell their stuff. You try a recipe from your favorite baker. You use the storytelling tricks of your favorite writer. You talk like your boss. We copy people we admire.

People with high status get respect and praise. So if a behavior can get us respect and praise, we like it.

We also try to avoid things that make us look bad. We clean our yard because we don’t want to be the messy neighbor. We tidy the house when our mom visits because we don’t want her to judge us. We always think, “What will others think of me?” and change what we do based on that.

The Polgar sisters, who were amazing chess players, show how much other people can affect what we do. They practiced chess for many hours every day for years. Their habits stayed strong because their culture valued them. Their parents praised them, and becoming grandmasters gave them more reasons to keep going.
