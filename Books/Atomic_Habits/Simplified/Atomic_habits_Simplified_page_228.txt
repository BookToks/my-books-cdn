Usually, people’s performance drops a little bit over time: K. Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool, Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise (Boston: Mariner Books, 2017), 13.

“The experts were saying”: Pat Riley and Byron Laursen, “Temporary Insanity and Other Management Techniques: The Los Angeles Lakers’ Coach Tells All,” Los Angeles Times Magazine, April 19, 1987, http://articles.latimes.com/1987–04–19/magazine/tm-1669_1_lakers.

There was a system called the Career Best Effort program or CBE: MacMullan’s book says Riley started his CBE program during the 1984–1985 NBA season. But my research shows the Lakers first tracked player stats then, and the CBE program as described was really first used in 1986–1987.

If they did well, it would be a CBE: Larry Bird, Earvin Johnson, and Jackie MacMullan, When the Game Was Ours (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010).

CONCLUSION

No one can be rich unless one coin can make them so: Desiderius Erasmus and Van Loon Hendrik Willem, The Praise of Folly (New York: Black, 1942), 31. Thanks to Gretchen Rubin. I first read about this story in her book, Better Than Before, and then found the original source. For more, see Gretchen Rubin, Better Than Before (New York: Hodder, 2016).

LITTLE LESSONS FROM THE FOUR LAWS

“Happiness is the space between one desire”: Caed (@caedbudris), “Happiness is the space between desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming,” Twitter, November 10, 2017, https://twitter.com/caedbudris/status/929042389930594304.

Happiness can’t be chased; it happens naturally: Frankl said, “Don’t aim directly at success. The more you try, the more you might miss it. Success, like happiness, can’t be chased; it shows up as a side effect of being dedicated to something bigger than yourself or caring for others.” For more, see Viktor E. Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy (Boston: Beacon Press, 1962).

“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”: Friedrich Nietzsche and Oscar Levy, The Twilight of the Idols (Edinburgh: Foulis, 1909).

Feelings come first (System 1): Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2015).

Appealing to emotions works better than appealing to logic: “If you want to persuade someone, appeal to their interest, not just reason” (Benjamin Franklin).

Satisfaction = Liking − Wanting: This is like David Meister’s fifth rule for service businesses: Satisfaction = perception − expectation.

“Being poor isn’t having too little; it’s wanting more”: Lucius Annaeus Seneca and Anna Lydia Motto, Moral Epistles (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1985).

As Aristotle said: It’s not clear if Aristotle actually said this. People have said he did for centuries, but I couldn’t find the original source.
