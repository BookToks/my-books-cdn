HOW TO SET UP YOUR SPACE FOR SUCCESS

Back in the 1970s, during the energy crisis, some Dutch researchers studied how people used energy. In one neighborhood near Amsterdam, they noticed some homeowners used 30% less energy than their neighbors, even though the houses were about the same size and had the same electricity prices.

The only difference was where the electrical meters were placed. Some had the meter in the basement, while others had it upstairs in the main hallway. The houses with meters in the hallway used less electricity.

When people could easily see how much energy they were using, they changed their habits.

Every habit starts with a signal, and we notice signals that stand out more. Sadly, many places we live or work in make it easy to skip good habits because there’s no clear signal to remind us. It’s easy not to practice guitar if it’s hidden in the closet.

It’s easy not to read a book if the bookshelf is tucked away in the guest room. It’s easy to forget vitamins if they’re hidden in the pantry.

When habit signals are hard to spot, we often ignore them.

On the other hand, clear signals can help us focus on good habits. In the early 1990s, cleaning workers at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam put small stickers that looked like flies in the middle of urinals. Men aimed at the “fly,” which helped reduce messes around the urinals. This trick lowered cleaning costs by 8% each year.

I’ve seen how clear signals work in my own life. I used to buy apples, put them in the fridge’s crisper, and then forget about them. By the time I remembered, the apples were bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.

Then I changed my setup. I bought a big bowl and put it right in the middle of the kitchen counter. Next time I bought apples, I put them there—where I could see them easily. Almost like magic, I started eating a few apples every day just because they were clearly visible.
