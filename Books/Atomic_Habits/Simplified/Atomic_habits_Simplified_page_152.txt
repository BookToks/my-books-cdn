How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

In 1993, a bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-three-year-old stockbroker named Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a small town near Vancouver, where most big business deals happened. Since Dyrsmid was new and from a small town, no one expected much from him. But he got better quickly because of a simple daily habit.

Every morning, Dyrsmid had two jars on his desk. One jar had 120 paper clips, and the other was empty. As soon as he started work, he would make a sales call. Right after the call, he moved one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and then made another call. He said, “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and keep dialing until I moved them all to the other jar.”

In just eighteen months, Dyrsmid was earning $5 million for the bank. By age twenty-four, he made $75,000 a year, which is like $125,000 today. Soon after, he got a job paying over $100,000 with another company.

I call this the Paper Clip Strategy, and many people have used it in different ways. One woman moved a hairpin from one container to another every time she wrote a page of her book. A man moved a marble after each set of push-ups.

Seeing your progress feels good, and moving paper clips, hairpins, or marbles shows you how much you’ve done. This helps keep you motivated and makes the activity more satisfying right away. You can track progress in many ways: food journals, workout logs, punch cards, progress bars on downloads, or book page numbers. But the best way to track your progress might be using a habit tracker.
