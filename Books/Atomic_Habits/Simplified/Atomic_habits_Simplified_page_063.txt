For example: Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.

Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes.

Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened today.

Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss.

Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family member where I am running and how long it will take.

The key is to link your new habit to something you already do every day. Once you get good at this, you can start making bigger habit stacks by joining small habits together. This helps you keep going because one habit naturally leads to the next—a good kind of momentum called the Diderot Effect.
