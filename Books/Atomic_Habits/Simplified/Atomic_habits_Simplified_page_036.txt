Your new identity is shown by the small habits you do. This is why big changes don’t need to be sudden or huge. Small habits can make a real difference because they prove who you are becoming. If a change matters, it’s actually a big deal. That’s the strange thing about small improvements.

When you put this all together, you see that habits help you change who you are. The best way to become a new person is to change what you do.

Every time you write a page, you become a writer.

Every time you practice the violin, you become a musician.

Every time you start a workout, you become an athlete.

Every time you encourage your team, you become a leader.

Each habit not only helps you get results but also teaches you something more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually do these things. When you add up all your good actions, your story about yourself starts to change.

But it works the other way too. Every time you do a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is you don’t have to be perfect. Like in an election, there will be votes for both sides. You don’t need everyone to agree; you just need most votes. It’s okay if you do a bad habit sometimes. Your goal is to do good habits most of the time.

New identities need new proof. If you keep doing the same things, you’ll get the same results. If nothing changes, nothing will change.

It’s a simple two-step process: 1. Decide what kind of person you want to be.

2. Show yourself by winning small battles.

First, decide who you want to be. This works for anyone—whether you’re alone, part of a team, a community, or a country. What do you want to stand for? What are your values? Who do you want to become?

These are big questions, and many people don’t know where to start—but they do know what results they want: like getting six-pack abs or feeling better.
