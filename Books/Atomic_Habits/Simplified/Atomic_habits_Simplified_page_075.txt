Trying to eat healthier? You probably shop without thinking at your usual supermarket. Try going to a different grocery store. It might be easier to avoid junk food when your brain doesn’t know where it is.

If you can’t go somewhere new, change your current space. Make different spots for work, study, exercise, fun, and cooking. I like to say, “One space, one use.” When I started working for myself, I worked on my couch or kitchen table. At night, it was hard to stop working. There was no clear line between work time and personal time. Was the kitchen table for work or eating? Was the couch for relaxing or sending emails? Everything happened in the same place.

Try not to mix different habits in the same place. When you mix them, the easier habit usually wins. This is why phones are both helpful and tricky. You can do many things on a phone, which is cool. But it’s hard to think of a phone as just one thing. You want to be productive, but you also want to check social media, emails, and games. It’s confusing.

You might say, “I live in a tiny apartment in New York City. I need rooms to do many things.” That’s okay. If space is small, make zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do this with your devices too. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a special place.

If you stick to this plan, each place will remind you of a certain habit and way of thinking. Habits work best in steady situations like these. Focus comes easier when you sit at your work desk. Relaxing feels better in a space made for that. Sleep comes faster when your bedroom is only for sleeping. If you want habits that last, you need an
