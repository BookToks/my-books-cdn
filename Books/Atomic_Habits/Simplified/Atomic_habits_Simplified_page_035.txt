Your habits show who you really are. When you make your bed every day, it shows you’re organized. When you write every day, it shows you’re creative. When you work out every day, it shows you’re athletic.

The more you do something, the more it proves who you are. The word “identity” comes from Latin words that mean “being” and “repeatedly.” So, your identity is basically what you do over and over again. You believe in your identity because you have proof. If you go to church every Sunday for years, that shows you’re religious. If you study biology every night, that shows you’re hardworking. If you go to the gym even when it’s cold and snowy, that shows you’re serious about fitness. The more proof you have, the stronger your belief in yourself.

When I was younger, I didn’t think of myself as a writer. My teachers would say I was just an okay writer, nothing special. But when I started my writing career, I wrote a new article every Monday and Thursday for years. The more I wrote, the more I saw myself as a writer. I didn’t start as a writer—I became one through my habits.

Habits aren’t the only things that shape who you are, but because you do them so often, they’re usually the most important. Every experience changes how you see yourself, but just doing something once doesn’t make you that person. You wouldn’t call yourself a soccer player just because you kicked a ball once, or an artist because you doodled a picture. But when you do these things again and again, it adds up and changes how you see yourself. One-time experiences fade away, but habits get stronger with time. So, your habits are the main things that shape your identity. Building habits is really the same as becoming who you want to be.

This change happens slowly. You don’t just decide one day to be someone completely different. You change little by little, day by day, habit by habit. We are always slowly becoming a new version of ourselves.

Each habit is like a hint: “Maybe this is who I am.” If you finish a book, maybe you’re someone who likes reading. If you go to the gym, maybe you’re someone who likes exercise. If you practice guitar, maybe you’re someone who loves music.

Every action you take is like a vote for the person you want to become. One action won’t change everything, but as you keep doing them, your beliefs about yourself grow stronger.
