Wyla Harp is known as one of the best dancers and choreographers today. In 1992, she won a special award called the MacArthur Fellowship, also known as the Genius Grant. She has spent most of her life traveling the world to perform her own dance shows. She says that simple daily habits helped her a lot in becoming successful.

She says, “I start every day the same way. I wake up at 5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, leg warmers, sweatshirt, and hat. Then I walk outside my home in Manhattan, get a taxi, and tell the driver to take me to the Pumping Iron gym. I work out there for two hours.”

She explains, “The important part of my routine isn’t just the stretching and weight training. The real ritual is getting into the cab. As soon as I tell the driver where to go, I’ve finished my ritual.”

She adds, “It’s a simple thing, but doing it the same way every morning makes it a habit. This means it’s easy to do and I don’t have to think about it. It helps me keep my routines steady and stop me from skipping it or changing it.”

Getting a cab every morning might seem small, but it’s a great example of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.

Scientists say that 40 to 50 percent of what we do each day is because of habits. This number is already pretty big, but habits actually affect us even more than that. Habits are automatic actions that also influence the choices we make after them. A habit might take just a few seconds, but it can affect what you do for minutes or even hours later.

Habits are like the ramp that leads you onto a highway. They guide you down a certain path.
