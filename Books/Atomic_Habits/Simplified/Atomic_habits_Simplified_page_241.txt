If you’ve read The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, you’ll know these ideas.

Duhigg wrote a really good book, and I want to continue his work by turning these stages into four easy rules you can use to build better habits in your life and work.

Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve a lot of credit for inspiring this image. This habit loop shows words from Duhigg’s book, The Power of Habit, and a design style from Eyal’s book, Hooked.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
