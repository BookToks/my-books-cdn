PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE

Oswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He also knows how to set up his space to make things easier.

Nuckols has a cleaning habit he calls “resetting the room.” For example, after watching TV, he puts the remote back on the stand, fixes the pillows, and folds the blanket. When he leaves his car, he throws away trash. When he takes a shower, he wipes the toilet while the water is warming up. (He says this is the best time to clean the toilet.) The goal is not just to clean but to get the room ready for what comes next.

“When I walk into a room, everything is in its right place,” Nuckols said.

“Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape. People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. I’m just lazily smart. It saves me a lot of time.” When you organize a space for what you want to do, you make it easier to do that thing. For example, my wife keeps boxes of greeting cards sorted by occasion—birthday, sympathy, wedding, graduation, and more. When she needs a card, she just grabs the right one and sends it. She’s great at remembering to send cards because it’s simple for her. I used to be the opposite. Someone would have a baby, and I’d think, “I should send a card.” But weeks passed and when I finally remembered to buy one, it was too late. It was hard to keep the habit.

There are many ways to set up your space so it’s ready to use right away. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, put the skillet on the stove, spray on the counter, and plates and utensils ready the night before. Then in the morning, making breakfast is easy.

Want to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing tools on your desk where you can reach them.

Want to exercise? Lay out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and water bottle before you start.

Want to eat healthier? Chop lots of fruits and veggies on the weekend and keep them in containers. Then you have healthy snacks ready all week.
