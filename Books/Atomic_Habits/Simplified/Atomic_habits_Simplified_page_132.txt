Sandeep Gautam, when starting a journaling habit, he wrote less than he wanted to. He always stopped before it felt like a chore. Ernest Hemingway gave similar advice for any writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said.

This kind of strategy works for another reason: it helps build the person you want to become. If you go to the gym five days in a row—even if it’s just for two minutes—you’re proving you can do it. You’re not thinking about getting fit yet. You’re focused on being someone who doesn’t skip workouts. You’re taking a small step that shows who you want to be.

Most people don’t think about change this way because they only care about the final goal. But doing one push-up is better than not exercising at all. Practicing guitar for one minute is better than not practicing at all. Reading for one minute is better than never opening a book. It’s better to do less than you planned than to do nothing.

Once you’ve built the habit and you’re doing it every day, you can use the Two-Minute Rule with something called habit shaping to grow your habit back to your main goal. Start by getting really good at the first two minutes of the smallest version of the habit. Then move to the next step and do the same—focus on the first two minutes and master it before going further.

Soon, you’ll have the habit you wanted, while still focusing on those important first two minutes.

Here are some examples of habit shaping:

Becoming an Early Riser  
Phase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night.  
Phase 2: Turn off all devices (TV, phone, etc.) by 10 p.m. every night.  
Phase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (reading or talking).  
Phase 4: Lights off by 10 p.m. every night.  
Phase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day.

Becoming Vegan  
Phase 1: Start eating vegetables at every meal.  
Phase 2: Stop eating animals with four legs (like cows, pigs, lambs).  
Phase 3: Stop eating animals with two legs (like chicken, turkey).  
Phase 4: Stop eating animals with no legs (like fish, clams, scallops).  
Phase 5: Stop eating all animal products (eggs, milk, cheese).
