The biggest threat to success isn’t failure, it’s boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop being fun. The results become predictable. And as our habits feel normal, we start messing up our progress to find something new.

Maybe this is why we keep jumping from one workout to another, one diet to another, or one business idea to another. As soon as our motivation drops a little, we look for a new plan—even if the old one was still working. Machiavelli said, “People want new things so much that even those doing well want change as much as those doing badly.” This might be why many addictive products always offer something new. Video games show new sights. Porn gives new sexual experiences. Junk food offers new tastes. Each of these keeps surprising us.

In psychology, this is called a variable reward. Slot machines are a good example. A gambler wins sometimes but not on a set schedule. The timing of wins changes. This makes the brain release the most dopamine, helps us remember better, and makes habits form faster.

Variable rewards won’t make people want something they don’t care about. But they do make cravings stronger by making things less boring.

The best feeling of wanting happens when success and failure are split about half and half.

Half the time you get what you want. Half the time you don’t. You need just enough wins to feel good and just enough wanting to keep trying. This is one reason the Goldilocks Rule works. If you already like a habit, doing challenges that are just the right difficulty helps keep it fun.

Of course, not all habits have variable rewards, and that’s okay. If Google only gave good search results sometimes, I’d switch to another search engine fast. If Uber only picked me up half the time, I wouldn’t use it much. And if I flossed but only sometimes ended up with clean teeth, I’d probably stop doing it.

Variable rewards or not, no habit stays interesting forever. At some point, everyone trying to improve has to learn to accept boredom.

We all have goals and dreams, but it doesn’t matter what you want to get better at—if you only do the work when it’s easy or exciting, you’ll never be successful.
