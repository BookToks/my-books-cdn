Chapter Summary There are three kinds of change: changing the results you get, changing how you do things, and changing who you are.

The best way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to do, but on the person you want to be.

Your identity comes from your habits. Every action you take is like a vote for the kind of person you want to become.

To become the best version of yourself, you need to keep changing your beliefs and improving who you are.

Habits matter not just because they can help you get better results (which they can), but because they can change how you see yourself.
