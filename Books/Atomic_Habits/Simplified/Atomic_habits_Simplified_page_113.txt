11 Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

One day in class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida, split his film photography students into two groups.

Everyone on the left side of the classroom was put in the “quantity” group. They would be graded only by how many photos they made. On the last day of class, he would count the number of photos each student turned in. One hundred photos meant an A, ninety meant a B, eighty a C, and so on.

The students on the right side were the “quality” group. They were graded only on how good their work was. They only had to make one photo all semester, but to get an A, that photo had to be almost perfect.

At the end of the term, Jerry was surprised that the best photos came from the quantity group. Those students kept taking pictures, trying out different ways to arrange things, playing with lighting, testing new techniques in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. By making hundreds of photos, they got better and better.

Meanwhile, the quality group spent their time just thinking about making a perfect photo. In the end, they didn’t have much to show except one average picture and a lot of ideas that never got tested.

It’s easy to get stuck trying to find the best plan to change something—like the fastest way to lose weight, the best workout program, or the perfect side job idea. We focus so much on finding the perfect way that we never actually do anything.

As Voltaire said, “The best is the enemy of the good.” I call this the difference between being in motion and taking action. They sound alike but aren’t the same. Being in motion means you’re planning, learning, and thinking, which is good but doesn’t get results. Taking action means actually doing something that moves you forward.
