There are four steps to how habits work: cue, response, and reward—and four rules for changing habits based on these steps. If you know a bit about psychology, you might recognize these ideas from operant conditioning. This was first called “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and later became popular as “cue, routine, reward” in the book The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.

Scientists like Skinner found that giving the right reward or punishment could make people act a certain way. But while Skinner's idea explained how outside things affect our habits, it didn’t really explain how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs change what we do. Our moods and emotions matter too. Recently, scientists have started to understand how our thoughts and feelings connect to our behavior. This book will talk about that too.

The model I’m sharing mixes ideas about how we think and how we act. I think it’s one of the first models that truly explains how both outside things and our inner feelings shape our habits. Even if some words seem familiar, I’m sure the details—and the way the Four Laws of Behavior Change work—will give you a new way to look at your habits.

People’s behavior is always changing from one moment to the next. But this book is about what stays the same. It’s about the basic rules of human behavior that you can count on year after year. These are ideas you can use to build a business, a family, or a life.

There isn’t just one perfect way to make better habits, but this book shows the best way I know. It works no matter where you’re starting or what you want to change. The strategies here will help anyone who wants a clear plan to improve—whether your goals are about health, money, work, relationships, or all of those. As long as people are involved, this book will help guide you.
