When I started college at Denison University, it was a fresh start for me. That’s when I first learned how small habits can really make a big difference.

Going to Denison was one of the best choices I ever made. I got a spot on the baseball team, and even though I was at the bottom as a freshman, I was super excited. After a tough time in high school, I had finally become a college athlete.

I knew I wouldn’t be starting on the team right away, so I focused on fixing my life. While other students stayed up late playing video games, I made sure to go to bed early and get good sleep. Even though college dorms can be messy, I kept my room clean. These little changes helped me feel more in control. I started to believe in myself again. This helped me do better in school, and I got straight A’s in my first year.

A habit is something you do regularly, often without even thinking about it. Each semester, I built small habits that added up to big results. For example, I started lifting weights a few times a week. Over the years, I went from weighing 170 pounds to a strong, lean 200 pounds.

By my sophomore year, I became a starting pitcher. In my junior year, I was made team captain and was picked for the all-conference team. But it was during my senior year that my sleep, study, and workout habits really paid off.

Six years after being hit in the face with a baseball bat, going to the hospital, and being in a coma, I was named the top male athlete at Denison. I also made the ESPN Academic All-America Team, an award given to only thirty-three players in the whole country. By the time I graduated, I held eight school records.

That same year, I received the university’s highest academic award, the President’s Medal.

I hope this doesn’t sound like I’m bragging. Honestly, my athletic career wasn’t legendary or historic. I never ended up playing
