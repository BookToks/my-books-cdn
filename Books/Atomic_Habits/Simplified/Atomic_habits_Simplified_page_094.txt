9 The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

I’m a Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar. In 1965, I wrote a bunch of unusual letters to a woman named Klara.

I really believed in hard work. Actually, that was all I believed in—I didn’t think people were born with special talents. I thought that if a kid practiced a lot and built good habits, they could be a genius at anything. My saying was, “A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.” I believed this so much that I wanted to try it out with my own kids. I wrote to Klara because I needed a wife who agreed with me.

Klara was a teacher, and even if she wasn’t as sure as I was, she also believed that with good teaching, anyone could get better at something.

I chose chess for our experiment. I made a plan to raise our kids to be chess superstars. They would be taught at home, which was unusual in Hungary back then. Our house would have lots of chess books and pictures of famous players. The kids would always play chess against each other and enter the best competitions they could find. We kept detailed records of every player they met in tournaments. Chess would be their whole life.

I won Klara’s heart, and a few years later, we had three daughters: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.

Susan, the oldest, started playing chess when she was four. After just six months, she was beating adults.

Sofia, the middle daughter, did even better. By age fourteen, she was a world champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster.

Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. At five, she could beat her dad.

By twelve, she was the youngest player ever ranked in the top one hundred.
