MAXIMUM motivation happens when you face a challenge that’s just the right amount of hard—not too easy, not too hard. Psychologists call this the Yerkes–Dodson law. It means you feel just the right amount of excitement between being bored and feeling stressed.

Martin’s comedy career shows this idea well. Every year, he made his routine a little longer—only by a minute or two. He kept adding new jokes but also kept some old ones that always made people laugh. He had enough wins to stay motivated and enough mistakes to keep trying hard.

When you start a new habit, it’s important to make it as easy as possible so you don’t give up, even if things aren’t perfect. This idea was explained earlier when talking about the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.

But once your habit is going, you should try to get a little better bit by bit. These small changes and new challenges keep you interested. If you find the “Goldilocks Zone” just right, you can get into a flow state. This means you are “in the zone” and fully focused on what you are doing. Scientists say to reach this flow, the task should be about 4 percent harder than what you can already do. In real life, it’s not always easy to measure exactly how hard something is.
