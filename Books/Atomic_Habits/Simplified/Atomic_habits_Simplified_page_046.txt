We can break these four steps into two parts: the problem part and the solution part. The problem part includes the cue and the craving, which is when you realize something needs to change. The solution part includes the response and the reward, which is when you take action and get the change you want.

Problem part: 1. Cue  2. Craving  
Solution part: 3. Response  4. Reward  
All behavior happens because you want to fix a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you see something good and want it. Sometimes the problem is that you feel pain and want to stop it. Either way, every habit helps you deal with problems you have.

In the table on the next page, you can see some examples of how this works in real life.

Imagine walking into a dark room and turning on the light. You’ve done this habit so many times that you don’t even think about it. You go through all four steps in just a moment. The urge to act hits you without thinking.

Problem part: 1. Cue: Your phone buzzes with a new text.  
2. Craving: You want to see what the message says.

Solution part: 3. Response: You grab your phone and read it.  
4. Reward: You feel good because you read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes linked to the buzzing sound.

Problem part: 1. Cue: You are answering emails.  
2. Craving: You start feeling stressed and want to feel calm.

Solution part: 3. Response: You bite your nails.  
4. Reward: You feel less stressed. Biting your nails becomes linked to answering emails.
