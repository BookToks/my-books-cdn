Here’s the problem: most people know it’s smarter to wait for rewards instead of going for instant fun. They want to be healthy, get things done, and feel calm. But when it really counts, those things don’t usually come to mind.

Luckily, you can train yourself to wait for rewards—but you have to work with how people naturally think, not against it. The best way is to add a little bit of quick fun to habits that help you in the long run and a little bit of quick discomfort to habits that don’t.

HOW TO USE INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO HELP YOU The key to sticking with a habit is feeling successful—even if it’s just a little. Feeling successful tells your brain the habit was worth it.

In a perfect world, doing a good habit would feel like a reward by itself. But in real life, good habits only feel worth it after they actually help you. At first, it feels like you’re just giving something up. You go to the gym a few times, but you don’t see changes in your body yet.

Habit stacking, which we talked about before, links your habit to a quick signal, so you know when to start. Reinforcement links your habit to a quick reward, so finishing feels awesome.

Quick rewards help a lot when you’re trying to stop habits, like not spending money on useless stuff or not drinking alcohol for a month. It’s hard to stick with these because nothing happens when you skip a party or don’t buy new shoes. It’s tough to feel good when you’re just saying no.

You’re just fighting temptation, and that’s not very satisfying.

One way to fix this is to flip the situation. Make avoiding something more obvious. For example, open a savings account and name it for something you want—maybe
