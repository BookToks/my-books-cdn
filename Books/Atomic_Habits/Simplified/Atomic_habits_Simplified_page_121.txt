Energy is super important, and your brain is set up to save it whenever it can. People naturally follow the Law of Least Effort, which means when they have two similar choices, they pick the one that takes less work. For example, if you can grow crops by expanding your farm east where it’s easy, you won’t go north where the weather is different and harder. Out of all the things you could do, you’ll pick the one that gives you the most benefit for the least effort. We want to do what’s easy.

Every action takes some energy. The more energy it needs, the less likely you are to do it. If you want to do 100 push-ups a day, that’s a lot of effort! At first, you’re excited and can do it. But after a few days, it feels really tiring. On the other hand, doing just one push-up a day takes almost no energy, so it’s easier to keep doing it. The less energy a habit needs, the more likely you are to do it.

Look at any habit that takes up a lot of your time, like scrolling on your phone, checking emails, or watching TV. These things take almost no effort, so they end up stealing a lot of your time. They’re super convenient.

In a way, every habit is like a barrier between you and what you really want.

Eating healthy can feel like a barrier to getting fit. Meditating can feel like a barrier to feeling calm.

Journaling can feel like a barrier to thinking clearly. You don’t actually want the habit itself. You want what the habit gives you. The harder the habit is, the bigger the barrier between you and your goal. That’s why it’s so important to make your habits easy, so you’ll do them even if you don’t feel like it. The easier your good habits are, the more you’ll actually do them.

But what about those times when we do really hard stuff? If we’re all lazy, how do people raise kids, start businesses, or climb mountains?

You can definitely do hard things. The problem is that some days you want to work hard, and other days you want to give up. On tough days, it helps to make things as easy as possible so you can get through the challenges. The less you have to fight against, the easier it is for your strong side to come out.

The point of “make it easy” isn’t to only do easy stuff. It’s to make it as easy as possible to do things right now that will help you in the future.
