The change to a delayed-return environment probably started about ten thousand years ago when people began farming. They planted crops and waited months to harvest them.  

But it wasnâ€™t until the last few hundred years that our lives got full of delayed-return choices, like planning careers, saving for retirement, planning vacations, and other things that take time to pay off.  

Time inconsistency is another name for hyperbolic discounting.
