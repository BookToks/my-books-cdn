The book got a lot better because of your feedback.

Thanks to the team at Avery and Penguin Random House who helped make this book happen. I especially want to thank my publisher, Megan Newman, for being so patient when I kept asking for more time. She gave me the space I needed to write a book I’m proud of and supported my ideas all the way. Thanks to Nina for improving my writing but still keeping my original message. Thanks to Lindsay, Farin, Casey, and the rest of the Penguin Random House team for helping share this book with more people than I ever could on my own. And thanks to Pete Garceau for designing a beautiful cover.

Also, thank you to my agent, Lisa DiMona, for guiding me and giving great advice through the whole publishing process.

Thanks to all my friends and family who asked, “How’s the book going?” and cheered me on when I said, “Slowly.” Every writer has tough times while working on a book, and just one kind word can help you keep going the next day.

I’m sure I’ve forgotten some people, but I keep an updated list of everyone who has influenced me in important ways at jamesclear.com/thanks.

And finally, thank you. Life is short, and you chose to spend some of your valuable time reading this book. I really appreciate it.
