H T G Klein once told me a story about a woman who went to a family gathering. She had worked for years as a paramedic. When she saw her father-in-law, she got really worried.

“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.

Her father-in-law felt fine and joked back, “Well, I don’t like your looks, either.” But she was serious. “No,” she said. “You need to go to the hospital now.” A few hours later, doctors found a blockage in his artery and did emergency surgery. Without her gut feeling, he might have died.

So, what did the paramedic notice? How did she know he was about to have a heart attack?

When big arteries get blocked, the body sends blood to important organs and less to places near the skin’s surface.

This changes how blood shows up in the face. After many years helping people with heart problems, the woman had learned to spot this without even thinking. She couldn’t explain exactly what she saw, but she knew something was wrong.

There are similar stories in other jobs. For example, military experts can tell which blip on a radar is an enemy missile and which is a friendly plane, even if they look the same.

During the Gulf War, Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved a battleship by shooting down a missile that looked just like the ship’s own planes on radar. He made the right choice, but even his bosses didn’t know how he figured it out.
