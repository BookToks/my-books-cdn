In his famous book Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond talks about something simple but important: different continents have different shapes. This might seem obvious and not very important at first, but it actually affects how people live and behave.

The Americas (North and South America) are shaped mostly from north to south. That means they are tall and thin, not wide. Africa is kind of the same. But Europe, Asia, and the Middle East are shaped the other way—they stretch more from east to west.

Diamond says this difference in shape helped farming spread in different ways over time. When farming started, it was easier for farmers to move east and west than north and south. That’s because places on the same east-west line usually have similar weather, sunlight, and seasons.

This made it possible for farmers in Europe and Asia to grow the same crops across a huge area—from France all the way to China. So, the shape of continents changed how people learned to farm and live.
