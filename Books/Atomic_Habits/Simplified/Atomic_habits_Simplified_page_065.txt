1. After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate straight into the dishwasher.

2. After I put my dishes away, I will quickly wipe down the counter.

3. After I wipe the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for the next morning.

You can also add new habits into the middle of your current routines.

For example, maybe your morning routine is: Wake up > Make my bed > Take a shower. If you want to read more at night, you could change it to: Wake up > Make my bed > Put a book on my pillow > Take a shower.

Now, every night when you get into bed, a book will be waiting for you to read.

Habit stacking helps you create simple rules to guide what you do next. It’s like having a plan for each action. Once you get used to it, you can make habit stacks for different situations:

Exercise: When I see stairs, I will take them instead of the elevator.

Social skills: When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone new.

Money: When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait 24 hours before buying.

Healthy eating: When I serve my meal, I will put veggies on my plate first.

Minimalism: When I buy something new, I will give something away. (“One in, one out.”)

Mood: When the phone rings, I will take a deep breath and smile before answering.

Forgetfulness: When I leave a public place, I will check the table and chairs so I don’t forget anything.

The secret to making a good habit stack is picking the right reminder to get started. Unlike other plans that say exactly when and where to do something, habit stacking uses simple cues to help you build new habits.
