Here’s the solution.

Thorndike explained how we learn by saying, “Behaviors that have good results usually happen again, and behaviors that have bad results usually don’t.” His idea helps us understand how habits form in our lives. It also answers basic questions like: What are habits? And why does the brain even bother to make them?

WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS  
A habit is something you do so many times that it becomes automatic.

Habits start with trial and error. When you face something new, your brain has to figure out how to react. The first time you deal with a problem, you don’t know the answer. Like Thorndike’s cat, you just try different things to see what works.

During this time, your brain is very active. You pay close attention and make careful choices about what to do. You take in a lot of new information and try to understand it. Your brain is busy learning the best way to act.

Sometimes, like the cat hitting a lever, you find a solution by chance.

For example, if you’re feeling anxious and find that going for a run helps you calm down, or if you’re tired after a long day and discover that playing video games relaxes you. You keep exploring, and then—BAM—you get a reward.

After finding this reward, you change your plan for next time. Your brain quickly remembers what happened before the reward. It thinks, “That felt good. What did I do right before?”

This is how all human behavior works: try, fail, learn, try again differently. With practice, the things that don’t help disappear, and the helpful actions get stronger. This is how a habit forms.

When you face the same problem many times, your brain starts to solve it automatically. Habits are just automatic ways your brain solves problems you see over and over. Behavioral scientist Jason Hreha says, “Habits are simply reliable solutions to problems that happen again and again around us.” As habits form, your brain works less hard. You learn to notice the clues that mean you’ll succeed and ignore everything else. So when the same situation happens again, you know exactly what to do.
