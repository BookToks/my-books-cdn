There are many ways to use technology to help you build good habits and get rid of bad ones. Technology can make things that were once hard or annoying easy and simple. It’s a great way to make sure you do the right things.

This is really helpful for things you don’t do often, like once a month or once a year. For example, checking your investments isn’t something you do every day, so technology can remind you or do it for you.

Some examples are: Medicine—your prescriptions can be refilled automatically.

Money—your job can take money out of your paycheck to save for retirement.

Cooking—meal delivery services can buy groceries for you.

Productivity—you can block social media sites to stop wasting time.

When you automate as much as you can, you save time and energy for things machines can’t do yet. Every habit you let technology handle gives you more time to grow and do new things. As a famous thinker said, “Civilization moves forward by doing more things without having to think about them.”
