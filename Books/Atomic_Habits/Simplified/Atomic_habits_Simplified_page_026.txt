A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, it’s not your fault. The real problem is your system. Bad habits keep happening not because you don’t want to change, but because your system for change is wrong.

You don’t get better just by setting goals. You get better by having good systems.

This book focuses on the system, not just on one goal. That’s also what "atomic" means here. You probably know that an atomic habit means a tiny change, like a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits aren’t just small habits. They are small habits that are part of a bigger system. Just like atoms build molecules, atomic habits build amazing results.

Habits are like the atoms of your life. Each habit is a small part that helps you improve. At first, these small habits seem unimportant, but they add up and create bigger successes that grow much more than the effort you put in. They are small but very powerful. That’s what “atomic habits” means—a habit that’s easy to do but creates huge results because it’s part of a system that helps you grow over time.
