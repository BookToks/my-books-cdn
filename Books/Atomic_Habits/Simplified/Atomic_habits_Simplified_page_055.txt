When train operators get ready to leave a platform, they say, “All clear!” and point at everything while naming it out loud. This is called Pointing-and-Calling, and it’s a safety system made to stop mistakes. It might sound funny, but it works really well. Pointing-and-Calling lowers errors by up to 85% and reduces accidents by 30%. New York City’s subway uses a version where they just point, and after two years, the number of trains stopping in the wrong place dropped by 57%. 

Pointing-and-Calling works because it makes people more aware of what they’re doing. Operators use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, so they notice problems before something bad happens.

My wife does something like this too. When we’re about to leave for a trip, she says out loud the most important things she needs to pack.

“I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my husband.” When we do things over and over, we stop really thinking about them. After doing something a thousand times, we might miss something because we expect it to be the same as before.

We get so used to doing things the way we always have that we don’t ask if it’s the right way. Many times, we mess up because we aren’t paying attention to ourselves.

One big challenge in changing habits is staying aware of what we’re actually doing. That’s why bad habits can catch us by surprise. We need a “point-and-call” system for our own lives. That’s where the Habits Scorecard comes in—a simple tool to help you notice your habits better. To make your own, write down your daily habits.

Here’s an example of what your list might look like: Wake up, turn off alarm, check my phone, go to the bathroom, weigh myself, take a shower, brush my teeth, floss my teeth.
