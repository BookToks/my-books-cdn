Why do some people end up with bad habits while others get better and better because of good habits?

FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD

Most people say the best way to get what you want in life—like getting fit, starting a successful business, relaxing more, or spending time with friends and family—is to set clear goals.

For a long time, I thought the same way. I made goals for my grades, how much weight I wanted to lift, and how much money I wanted to make. Sometimes I did well, but a lot of times I failed. Then I realized that what really mattered wasn’t the goals I set, but the systems I followed every day.

So, what’s the difference between goals and systems? I learned this from Scott Adams, the guy who made the Dilbert comic. Goals are the results you want. Systems are the steps and habits that get you there.

For example, if you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is how you pick players, work with your assistant coaches, and run practice.

If you’re a business owner, your goal might be to make a million dollars. Your system is how you test new ideas, hire people, and advertise your products.

If you’re a musician, your goal might be to learn a new song. Your system is how often you practice, how you work on hard parts, and how you get feedback from your teacher.

Here’s a cool question: What if you ignored your goals and only focused on your system? Like, if you were a basketball coach and stopped thinking about winning the championship, but just focused on what your team does in practice every day, would you still get good results?

I believe you would.
