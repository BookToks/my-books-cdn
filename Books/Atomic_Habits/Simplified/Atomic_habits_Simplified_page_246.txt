A similar story is told in the book Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland. It has been changed a bit here with permission. You can check the endnotes for a full explanation.

This idea is very important in physics. It is called the Principle of Least Action. It says that when moving from one point to another, the path taken will always use the least amount of energy.

This simple idea is the basis for the laws of the universe. From just this one idea, you can explain how things move and even the theory of relativity.
