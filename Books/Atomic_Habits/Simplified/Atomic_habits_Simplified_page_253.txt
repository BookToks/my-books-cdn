If you’re watching Harry Potter over and over again, I get it.

I have a guess about what happens when we get into a flow state. This isn’t proven, just what I think. Psychologists say the brain works in two ways: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast and automatic.

Usually, things you do quickly without thinking, like habits, are controlled by System 1. System 2 handles harder thinking that takes more effort and time, like solving a tough math problem.

When it comes to flow, I imagine System 1 and System 2 as two ends of a thinking scale. The easier a task is, the more it’s on the System 1 side. The harder it is, the more it’s on the System 2 side. Flow happens right in the middle. You use all your automatic skills while also working hard to meet a challenge that’s a bit beyond what you can do. Both parts of your brain are fully active. Your conscious and unconscious mind are working perfectly together.
