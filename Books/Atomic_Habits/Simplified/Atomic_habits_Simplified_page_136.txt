Here’s another example: my friend Nir Eyal, who knows a lot about habits, bought an outlet timer. This is a device he plugs in between his internet router and the power outlet. Every night at 10 p.m., the timer turns off the power to the router. When the internet goes off, everyone in the house knows it’s time to go to bed.

Commitment devices are helpful because they let you use your good intentions before you get tempted to do something else. For example, when I want to eat less, I ask the waiter to split my meal and pack half to take home before the food even comes. If I wait until the food arrives and tell myself "I’ll just eat half," it usually doesn’t work.

The trick is to make it harder to stop a good habit than to start it. If you want to get fit, book a yoga class and pay for it ahead of time. If you’re excited about starting a business, email someone you respect and set up a call to talk about it. When it’s time to do these things, the only way to cancel is by putting in effort or losing money.

Commitment devices help you do the right thing later by making bad habits harder right now. But we can do even better. We can make good habits sure to happen and bad habits impossible.

HOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN

John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. As a kid, he did chores on his family farm and worked at his dad’s sawmill. After college at Dartmouth, he went back to Ohio and opened a small store selling supplies to coal miners.

It looked like a good chance to make money. The store didn’t have much competition and had steady customers, but it still had trouble making a profit. Then Patterson found out his workers were stealing from him.

Back in the mid-1800s, stealing by employees was a big problem. Receipts were kept in an open drawer and could be easily changed or thrown away. There were no cameras to watch people and no computer systems to track sales. Unless you watched your workers all day or managed every sale yourself, it was hard to stop theft.

While thinking about this problem, Patterson saw an ad for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier. It was made by another Dayton resident, James Ritty, and was the first cash register. The machine locked the cash and receipts inside automatically after every sale.
