When one person in a relationship loses weight, the other person also loses weight about one-third of the time. Our friends and family kind of push us to be like them without even realizing it.

Peer pressure is only bad if the people around you have bad habits.

For example, when astronaut Mike Massimino was a student at MIT, he took a small robotics class where four out of ten students became astronauts. If you wanted to go to space, that was the best group to be in. Also, one study showed that if your best friend’s IQ was high when you were 11 or 12, your IQ was likely higher at 15 too, even after considering natural intelligence. We pick up habits and traits from the people around us.

One of the best ways to build good habits is to join a group where the behavior you want is normal. New habits feel easier when you see others doing them every day. If you hang out with fit people, you’re more likely to think working out is normal. If you hang out with jazz fans, you’ll probably think playing jazz every day is normal. Your group sets what you think is “normal.” So, spend time with people who have the habits you want.

You’ll all improve together.

You can make this even better by joining a group where (1) the behavior you want is normal and (2) you already share something with the group. Steve Kamb, who runs Nerd Fitness in New York City, helps people who love video games, movies, and other stuff get healthy. Many people feel out of place when they first try to work out or eat better, but if you already have something in common—like a love for Star Wars—it feels easier to change because it’s something people like you do.

Nothing keeps you motivated like being part of a group. It turns your personal goal into a shared one. Before, you might have thought, “I’m a reader,” or “I’m a musician,” or “I’m an athlete,” all by yourself.

But when you join a book club, a band, or a cycling group, your identity connects with others. Growing and changing isn’t just something you do alone. We become readers, musicians, or cyclists together. This shared identity helps your own identity grow stronger. That’s why staying in a group after reaching a goal helps you keep your habits. Friendship and community make your new identity stick and help you keep going for a long time.
