"Leather Jacket." Whenever you decide not to buy something, put the same amount of money into a savings account. Skip your morning latte? Put $5 in. Skip Netflix for a month? Put $10 in. It’s like giving yourself a reward for good choices. Seeing your money grow toward buying that leather jacket feels way better than just feeling like you’re missing out. You’re making it fun to do nothing.

One of my readers and his wife tried something similar. They wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking together more. They called their savings account “Trip to Europe.” Every time they skipped eating out, they put $50 into the account. At the end of the year, they used the money for their vacation.

It’s important to pick rewards that match who you want to be, not ones that go against it. Buying a new jacket is okay if you want to lose weight or read more books, but it’s not great if you want to save money. Instead, doing something relaxing like a bubble bath or a walk is a good reward because it fits your goal of having more freedom and saving money. If you reward exercising by eating ice cream, it sends mixed messages and doesn’t help. But if your reward is a massage, it’s both a treat and helps you take care of your body. Now the reward fits with your goal of being healthy.

After a while, you’ll start feeling good naturally—like having more energy and less stress—and you won’t care as much about the small rewards.

Your identity becomes the real reason you keep doing it. You do it because it feels right and you like who you are. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need rewards to keep going. Rewards can help start a habit.

Identity keeps a habit going.

But it takes time to build proof that you’re changing and to feel like a new person. Quick rewards help keep you motivated while you wait for the bigger, long-term benefits.

In short, a habit has to be fun to last. Small rewards—like nice-smelling soap, fresh-tasting toothpaste, or seeing $50 go into your savings—give you quick happiness that makes the habit enjoyable. And change is easier when it’s fun.
