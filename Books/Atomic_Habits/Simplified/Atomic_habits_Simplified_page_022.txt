For a long time, nothing seems to change. Then, one day, things suddenly shift, like an earthquake caused by the pressure building up over time.

Change can take years to happen—but then it all happens at once.

Getting really good at something takes patience. The San Antonio Spurs, a famous basketball team, have a quote from Jacob Riis in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I watch a stonecutter hitting a rock, maybe a hundred times without a crack showing. But at the hundred and first hit, the rock splits. It’s not just that last hit—it’s all the hits before that.” 

We often expect progress to be fast and steady. But most of the time, results come much later than we think. Sometimes, after working hard for weeks or months, we feel disappointed because we don’t see any results. But the work was not wasted—it was just building up. Later, we see how valuable all that effort really was.

Big things start from small beginnings. Every habit begins with one tiny choice. When you repeat that choice, the habit grows stronger, like roots and branches on a tree. Breaking a bad habit is like pulling out a huge oak tree. Building a good habit is like growing a fragile flower, little by little.

So, what makes us keep going with a habit long enough to get past the hard part and finally see the results? What helps us push through?
