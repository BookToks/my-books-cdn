Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each.

Employee theft at his store stopped right away. In the next six months, Patterson’s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—that’s like more than $100,000 today.

Patterson liked the machine so much that he changed businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and started the National Cash Register Company. Ten years later, the company had over one thousand employees and was becoming one of the most successful businesses of its time.

The best way to stop a bad habit is to make it hard to do. Make it so tricky that you can’t even do it. The smart thing about the cash register was that it made stealing almost impossible. Instead of trying to change the employees, it made doing the right thing automatic.

Some actions—like buying a cash register—pay off again and again. These one-time choices take a little effort at first but keep giving benefits over time. I’m interested in the idea that one choice can keep helping you, so I asked my readers about their favorite one-time actions that help build good habits. The table on the next page shows some popular answers.

I believe that if most people did even half of the one-time actions on this list—without worrying about their habits—they would have a better life a year later. These one-time actions are a simple way to use the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.

They make it easier to sleep well, eat healthy, get things done, save money, and live better.
