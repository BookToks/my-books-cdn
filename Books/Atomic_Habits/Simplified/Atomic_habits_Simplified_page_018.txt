Even a tiny improvement can make a huge difference over time.

Here’s the math: if you get 1% better every day for a whole year, you’ll be 37 times better by the end.

But if you get 1% worse every day for a year, you’ll almost go down to zero. A small win or a small loss adds up to something much bigger.

Habits work like compound interest. Just like money grows with compound interest, your habits grow stronger as you keep doing them. They might not seem important each day, but after months or years, they make a huge impact. When you look back after a few years, you’ll really see how good habits helped you and bad habits hurt you.

This idea can be hard to get in daily life. We often ignore small changes because they don’t seem to matter right away.
