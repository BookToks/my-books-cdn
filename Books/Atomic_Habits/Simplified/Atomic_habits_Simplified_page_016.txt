British Cycling changed a lot in 2003. This group, which runs professional cycling in Great Britain, hired a new leader named Dave Brailsford. Before he came, British cyclists had been pretty average for almost 100 years.

Since 1908, British cyclists had only won one gold medal at the Olympics. They did even worse in the biggest cycling race, the Tour de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won it.

British riders were doing so badly that a top bike company in Europe didn’t want to sell bikes to the team. They thought it would hurt their sales if other pros saw British cyclists using their bikes.

Brailsford’s job was to help British Cycling get better. What made him different was his idea called “the aggregation of marginal gains.” This means looking for tiny ways to get just a little better in everything you do.

Brailsford said, “If you break down everything involved in riding a bike and improve each thing by 1 percent, it adds up to a big improvement.” He and his coaches started by making small changes you’d expect from a pro cycling team. They made bike seats more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires to help grip. Riders wore heated shorts to keep muscles warm and used sensors to see how workouts affected them. They tested different clothes in wind tunnels and switched to lighter, faster suits for outdoor riders.

But they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team kept finding small 1 percent improvements everywhere.
