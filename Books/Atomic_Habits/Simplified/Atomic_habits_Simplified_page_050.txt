A habit is something you do over and over until it becomes automatic.

Habits help us deal with lifeâ€™s problems using as little energy and effort as possible.

Every habit works like a loop with four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

The Four Laws of Behavior Change are easy rules to help us create better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.
