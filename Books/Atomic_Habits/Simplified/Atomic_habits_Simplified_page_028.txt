Why is it so easy to keep doing bad habits and so hard to start good ones? Changing your daily habits can seriously affect your life in a big way.

It often feels really hard to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even if you really want to and get motivated sometimes. Things like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking seem doable for a day or two but then just feel like a pain.

On the other hand, once your habits are set, they stick around forever—especially the bad ones. Even if you try hard, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much TV, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to stop.
