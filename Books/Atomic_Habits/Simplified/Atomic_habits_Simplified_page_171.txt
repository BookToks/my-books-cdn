People who liked noise when they were young were more likely to grow up to be outgoing. Those who didn’t like noise were more likely to become shy or quiet.

People who are very kind and friendly usually have more oxytocin, a hormone that helps us feel close to others, trust people, and feel happier. So, someone with more oxytocin might naturally like to write thank-you notes or plan parties.

Another trait is neuroticism, which means how much someone worries or feels anxious. People with high neuroticism often notice danger more easily because their brain’s alarm system, called the amygdala, is more sensitive. This makes them more likely to feel nervous about things.

Our habits aren’t only about personality, but our genes do push us in certain directions. Some habits come easier to some people than others. You don’t have to feel bad about this, but you do need to work with it. For example, if you aren’t naturally very organized, you might need to set up your space in a way that helps you stay on track. The main idea is to build habits that fit your personality. People can get super strong by bodybuilding, but if you like rock climbing or cycling more, do that instead. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you feel better with low-fat, go for it. If you want to read more, don’t be shy about loving romance novels instead of nonfiction. Read what you enjoy. You don’t have to follow the habits everyone else does. Pick what works best for you, not what’s most popular.

Every habit can be fun and make you happy if you find the right way to do it. Habits need to be enjoyable to last. This is the main idea behind the 4th Law.

Making habits that match your personality is a great start, but there’s more to it. Next, we’ll look at how to find or create situations where you have an advantage.
