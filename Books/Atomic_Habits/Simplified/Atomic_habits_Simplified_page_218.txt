CHAPTER 10

I wouldn’t just say, “Because I need food to survive.” I saw a similar idea on Twitter from the account simpolism (@simpolism). They said, “If society is like a human body, then the state is like the brain. People don’t always know why they do things. If someone asks, ‘Why do you eat?’ you might say ‘Because food tastes good,’ not ‘Because I need food to survive.’ So, what would be the state’s food? (Hint: Are pills food?)” This was tweeted on May 7, 2018.

When emotions and feelings don’t work right, it can cause problems. Antoine Bechara and others wrote about how damage to the brain’s front part makes people ignore future consequences.

Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio says emotions can actually help us make better decisions. You don’t “have” to do something; you “get” to do it. I learned this simple idea from my college coach, Mark Watts.

One person said, “I’m not stuck in my wheelchair,” which changed how they thought about life. Another said, “Instead of thinking ‘Go run in the morning,’ think ‘Go build endurance and get fast.’ Make your habits something good, not just a chore.”

Alison Wood Brooks studied how getting excited before doing something can help you focus. Scientists Wendy Berry Mendes and Jeremy Jamieson found that people do better when they think their fast heartbeat and quick breathing are helping them perform well. 

Boxer and writer Ed Latimore noticed that just putting on headphones helps him focus better, even if he doesn’t play music.
