14 How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

Victor Hugo had a really hard deadline to meet. In the summer of 1830, the French writer promised his publisher a new book a year earlier. But instead of writing, he spent that time doing other things, hanging out with friends, and putting off his work. His publisher got annoyed and set a new deadline less than six months away. The book had to be done by February 1831.

To stop himself from procrastinating, Hugo came up with a strange idea. He gathered all his clothes and asked his helper to lock them in a big chest. He only had one thing left to wear, a big shawl. Since he didn’t have any proper clothes to go outside, he stayed in his study and wrote a lot during the fall and winter of 1830. His book, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, was finished two weeks early on January 14, 1831.

Sometimes, doing well isn’t about making good habits easy but about making bad habits hard. This flips the usual advice about changing habits: make it difficult. If you keep struggling to stick to your plans, you can try what Victor Hugo did and make your bad habits harder by using something called a commitment device.

A commitment device is a choice you make now that controls what you do later. It helps you lock in good habits and stop bad ones. When Hugo locked away his clothes so he could focus on writing, he was using a commitment device. There are many ways to do this. For example, you can stop overeating by buying food in small packages instead of big ones.

You could also ask to be banned from casinos or online poker sites to stop yourself from gambling. Some athletes who need to lose weight for a competition even leave their wallets at home during the week before the weigh-in so they don’t buy junk food.
