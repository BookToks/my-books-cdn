CHAPTER 3 Edward Thorndike did an experiment, which you can read about in Peter Gray’s book Psychology, 6th edition.

He showed that animals can learn by doing simple things, like pulling a loop of cord.

Thorndike said that when a behavior is followed by a good feeling, it is more likely to happen again. If it causes discomfort, it is less likely to happen again.

When we form habits, our brain is very active.

Habits are basically reliable ways to solve problems.

As habits form, the brain remembers what happened before.

Our conscious mind can only focus on one thing at a time.

Because of this, the conscious mind tries to hand off tasks to habits.

Habits help reduce how much thinking we have to do.

We feel pleasure when things go well and disappointment when they don’t.
