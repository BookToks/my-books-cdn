Chapter Summary: The opposite of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is to make a habit unsatisfying.

We are less likely to keep doing a bad habit if it feels painful or unsatisfying.

Having an accountability partner can make not doing something feel like a cost. We care a lot about what others think, and we don’t want them to think less of us.

A habit contract can add a social cost to any behavior. It makes breaking your promises public and unpleasant.

Knowing that someone is watching you can be a strong motivator.

HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT  
The 1st Law: Make It Obvious  
1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to notice them.  
1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”  
1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”  
1.4: Design your environment. Make the signs of good habits easy to see.  

The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive  
2.1: Use temptation bundling. Do something you want to do together with something you need to do.  
2.2: Join a group where your desired behavior is normal.  
2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something fun right before a hard habit.  

The 3rd Law: Make It Easy  
3.1: Reduce friction. Cut down the steps between you and your good habits.  
3.2: Prime the environment. Get your space ready to make future actions easier.  
3.3: Master the decisive moment. Focus on small choices that make a big difference.  
3.4: Use the Two-Minute Rule. Shrink your habits until they take two minutes or less.  
3.5: Automate your habits. Use technology or one-time purchases to lock in future behavior.  

The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying  
4.1: Use reinforcement. Give yourself a quick reward when you finish your habit.  
4.2: Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, find a way to enjoy the benefits.  
4.3: Use a habit tracker. Keep track of how many times you’ve done your habit and “don’t break the chain.”  
4.4: Never miss twice. If you forget to do a habit, make sure you start again right away.
