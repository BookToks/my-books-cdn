Chapter Summary  
The good thing about habits is that they help us do things without having to think about them. The bad thing is that we might miss small mistakes.

Habits + Practice = Getting really good  
Thinking about what you did and checking your work helps you stay aware of how well you are doing over time.

The more we stick to one idea of who we are, the harder it is to change and grow.
