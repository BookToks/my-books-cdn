In the 1940s, a Dutch scientist named Niko Tinbergen did some experiments that changed how we understand what drives us. Tinbergen, who later won a Nobel Prize, studied herring gulls, which are gray and white birds often seen flying near the beaches in North America.

Adult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beaks. Tinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would peck at this dot whenever they wanted food. For one experiment, he made fake cardboard beaks, just the head without a body. When the parent birds flew away, he put these fake beaks near the chicks. The beaks looked obviously fake, so he thought the baby birds would ignore them.

But when the chicks saw the red spot on the cardboard beak, they pecked at it just like it was their real momâ€™s beak. They seemed to really like the red spots, as if they were born to do that. Tinbergen found out that the bigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked. He even made a beak with three big red dots on it.

When he put this beak over the nest, the baby birds got super excited. They pecked the red spots like it was the best beak they had ever seen.

Tinbergen and his team found similar behavior in other animals too.

For example, the greylag goose is a bird that nests on the ground. Sometimes, when the mother goose moves around, one of the eggs rolls out and lands on the grass. When this happens, the goose will walk over and use its beak and neck to pull the egg back into the nest.

Tinbergen found out that the goose will try to pull any round object nearby, like a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The bigger the object, the more effort the goose puts in. One goose even tried really hard to roll a volleyball back and then sat on it. Just like the baby gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the geese are naturally wired to pull round things back to their nest.
