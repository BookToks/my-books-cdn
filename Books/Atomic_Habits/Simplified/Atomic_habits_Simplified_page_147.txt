The choices you make today don’t help you right away. If you do a good job at work, you’ll get paid in a few weeks. If you exercise today, you might not be overweight next year. If you save money now, you could have enough for retirement many years later. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you have to wait a long time before you see the results of what you do.

The human brain didn’t evolve to live in this kind of environment. The oldest modern human fossils, called Homo sapiens sapiens, are about two hundred thousand years old. These early humans had brains pretty similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the brain that controls things like language—was about the same size back then as it is now. You have the same basic brain as your ancient ancestors.

It’s only in the last five hundred years or so that society started to work mostly in a delayed-return way. Compared to how old the human brain is, modern society is super new. In just the last hundred years, we’ve seen the invention of cars, airplanes, TV, computers, the internet, smartphones, and even Beyoncé. The world has changed a lot recently, but human nature hasn’t changed much.

Like other animals living on the African savannah, our ancestors spent their days dealing with big dangers, finding food, and staying safe from storms. It made sense back then to want rewards right away. The future wasn’t a big deal. After thousands of generations in this kind of environment, our brains got used to wanting quick rewards more than waiting for long-term ones.

Behavioral economists call this “time inconsistency.” This means your brain values rewards differently depending on when you get them. You usually care more about rewards you can get right now than ones you might get later. Most of the time, this helps you because a sure reward now is better than a maybe reward later. But sometimes, this focus on instant rewards causes problems.

Why would someone smoke if they know it can cause lung cancer?

Why would someone eat too much even when they know it can make them obese?

Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can lead to diseases? When you understand how the brain works, these questions become easier to answer: the bad effects happen later, but the good feelings happen right away. Smoking might be deadly in ten years, but it helps reduce stress and cravings now. Eating too much can be harmful later, but it tastes good at the moment. Sex, safe or not, feels good immediately.
