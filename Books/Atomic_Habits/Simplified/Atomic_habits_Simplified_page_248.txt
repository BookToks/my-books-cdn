I made a habit journal to help people journal more easily. It has a “One Line Per Day” part where you just write one sentence about your day. You can find out more at atomichabits.com/journal.

It's funny how this story is a lot like how I wrote this book. My publisher was nicer, and I still had clothes in my closet, but I did feel like I had to stay home and focus to finish writing.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
