Figure 6 shows that habits happen in four steps, which work like a loop. This loop keeps going all the time while you are alive. It watches what’s around you, guesses what might happen next, tries different actions, and learns from what happens.

First, something called a cue makes you want something. This want, or craving, pushes you to do something. When you do it, you get a reward. The reward makes you feel good and satisfies your craving. Over time, the cue and the reward get linked together in your brain.

These four steps—cue, craving, response, and reward—make a loop that helps you build habits automatically. This loop is always working, even right now. Your brain is always paying attention to your surroundings, guessing what’s next, trying stuff out, and learning fast.

This whole process happens really fast, in just a split second, and you do it again and again without even noticing how much your brain is doing.
