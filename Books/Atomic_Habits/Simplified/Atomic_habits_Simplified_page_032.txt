People often try to reach their goals without thinking about the beliefs that influence their actions. They don’t change how they see themselves, and don’t realize that their old identity can ruin their new plans for change.

Every set of actions comes from a set of beliefs. For example, democracy is based on ideas like freedom, majority rule, and equality.

Dictatorships are based on very different beliefs, like total control and strict obedience. You can imagine many ways to get more people to vote in a democracy, but in a dictatorship, voting wouldn’t happen because it doesn’t fit with that system’s identity. Voting is something that can’t happen with certain beliefs.

This idea applies to people, organizations, and societies. There are beliefs and assumptions that shape how they act, a kind of identity behind their habits.

If your behavior doesn’t match who you are, it won’t last. You might want more money, but if you see yourself as someone who spends instead of earns, you’ll keep spending. You might want better health, but if you choose comfort over effort, you’ll keep relaxing instead of training. It’s hard to change your habits if you don’t change the beliefs that caused your old behavior. You might have a new goal and plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.

Brian Clark, a businessman from Boulder, Colorado, shows this well. “I’ve always chewed my fingernails,” he said. “It started when I was nervous and became a bad habit. One day, I decided to stop chewing until my nails grew out. By just trying hard, I did it.” Then, he did something unexpected.

“I asked my wife to book my first-ever manicure,” he said. “I thought if I paid to keep my nails nice, I wouldn’t chew them. And it worked, but not because of the money. The manicure made my fingers look really good for the first time. The manicurist even said I had healthy, attractive nails except for the chewing. Suddenly, I felt proud of my nails. Even though I never cared about that before, it changed everything. I haven’t chewed my nails since, not even once. That’s because now I take pride in caring for them.” The strongest kind of motivation is when a habit becomes part of who you are. It’s one thing to say, “I want this,” but it’s different to say, “I am this.”

The more pride you have in a part of your identity, the more...
