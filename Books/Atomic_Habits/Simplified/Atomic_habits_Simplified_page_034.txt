"I'm terrible with directions." "I'm not a morning person." "I forget people’s names all the time." "I'm always late." "I'm not good with technology." "I'm horrible at math." ... and lots of other similar things.

If you keep telling yourself these things for years, it’s easy to believe them as true. Over time, you start avoiding certain things because you think, "That’s just not me." You feel like you have to act the way you believe you are. So, you try hard not to do anything that goes against what you think about yourself.

The stronger a thought or habit is connected to who you think you are, the harder it is to change it. It feels easier to believe what your group or culture believes, or to do what fits your self-image, even if it’s wrong. The biggest problem when trying to improve yourself or a group is when your identity gets in the way. Good habits might make sense, but if they don’t match your identity, you won’t follow through with them.

Some days, you might struggle with habits because you’re busy, tired, stressed, or have other reasons. But in the long run, the main reason you don’t keep good habits is because your self-image blocks you. That’s why you can’t get stuck on just one idea of who you are. To grow, you need to unlearn old beliefs and keep changing your identity to become the best version of yourself.

So, here’s an important question: If your beliefs and how you see the world control how you act, where do those beliefs come from? How does your identity form? And how can you focus on new parts of yourself that help you and slowly get rid of the parts that hold you back?

THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY Your identity comes from your habits. You’re not born with fixed beliefs.

Every belief, even about yourself, is learned from your experiences.
