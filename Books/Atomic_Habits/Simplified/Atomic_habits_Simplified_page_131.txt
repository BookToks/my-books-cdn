People often think it’s strange to get excited about reading just one page, meditating for one minute, or making one sales call. But the real point isn’t about doing one thing. It’s about learning the habit of showing up. The truth is, you have to make a habit before you can get better at it. If you can’t even learn to show up, it’s hard to get good at the details. Instead of trying to make a perfect habit right away, do something easy more often. You have to make it a normal thing before you can make it better.

As you get good at showing up, the first two minutes become a small routine at the start of a bigger one. This isn’t just a trick to make habits easier—it’s the best way to get good at tough skills. The more you make a routine at the beginning, the easier it is to focus deeply and do great work. For example, by always doing the same warm-up before a workout, it’s easier to get ready to perform your best. By following the same routine before creative work, it’s easier to start working hard. By having a regular way to wind down, it’s easier to go to bed on time. You might not be able to make the whole process automatic, but you can make the first step automatic.

Make it easy to start and the rest will follow.

The Two-Minute Rule can feel like a trick to some people. You know the real goal is to do more than two minutes, so it might feel like you’re trying to fool yourself. Nobody really wants to just read one page or do one push-up or open their notes. And if you know it’s a trick, why would you fall for it?

If the Two-Minute Rule feels weird, try this: do it for two minutes and then stop. Go for a run, but stop after two minutes. Meditate, but stop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but stop after two minutes.

This isn’t just a way to start; it can be the whole habit. Your habit can be just one hundred and twenty seconds long.

One reader used this idea to lose over one hundred pounds. At first, he went to the gym every day but told himself he couldn’t stay longer than five minutes. He would exercise for five minutes and then leave. After a few weeks, he thought, “I’m always here anyway, so I might as well stay longer.” A few years later, he lost the weight.

Journaling is another example. Almost everyone can benefit from writing down their thoughts, but many people quit after a few days or avoid it because it feels like a chore. The secret is to always keep it easy and not let it feel like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the UK, built a daily habit this way.
