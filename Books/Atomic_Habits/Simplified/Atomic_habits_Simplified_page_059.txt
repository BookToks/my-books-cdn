In 2001, researchers in Great Britain worked with 248 people to help them build better exercise habits over two weeks. They divided the people into three groups.

The first group was the control group. They were just asked to keep track of how often they exercised.

The second group was the “motivation” group. They had to track their workouts and also read about the benefits of exercise. The researchers explained how exercise can lower the chance of heart disease and make your heart healthier.

The third group got the same information as the second group to keep them equally motivated. But they also had to make a plan for when and where they would exercise in the next week. Each person in this group filled in this sentence: “During the next week, I will do at least 20 minutes of hard exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].” 

In the first and second groups, only 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once a week. (The motivation stuff didn’t really change how they acted.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once a week—more than twice as many!

The sentence they filled out is called an implementation intention. It’s a plan you make ahead of time about when and where you will do something.

This plan helps you know exactly how you want to start a new habit.

Habits can be triggered by many things, like your phone buzzing, the smell of cookies, or sirens. But the two most common triggers are time and place. Implementation intentions use both time and place to help you stick to your habit.
