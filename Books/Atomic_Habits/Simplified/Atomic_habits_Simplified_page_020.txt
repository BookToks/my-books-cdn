If you want to know where you’ll end up in life, just look at the small choices you make every day. These tiny wins or losses add up over 10 or 20 years. Are you spending less money than you earn each month? Are you going to the gym regularly? Are you reading and learning new things every day? These small daily habits will shape who you become.

Time makes the difference between success and failure bigger and bigger. It multiplies whatever you put into it. Good habits make time work for you. Bad habits make time work against you.

Habits can be good or bad. Bad habits can hurt you just like good habits can help you. So it’s important to understand how habits work and how to create good ones, so you don’t get stuck with bad ones.

YOUR HABITS CAN HELP YOU OR HURT YOU

Good habits add up. Getting one extra thing done each day might seem small, but over your whole life, it matters a lot. Learning a new skill or making a task automatic saves your brain energy, so you can focus on other stuff.

Learning new things also adds up. One new idea won’t change everything, but if you keep learning your whole life, it can change you a lot. Every book you read teaches you something new and helps you see old ideas in new ways. Warren Buffett says knowledge grows like compound interest—it builds up over time.

Relationships add up too. People act like mirrors, reflecting how you treat them. The more you help others, the more they want to help you. Being a little nicer every time you meet someone can build a big network of friends and support over time.

Bad habits add up too.

Stress builds up. Things like traffic jams, parenting, money worries, and health problems might seem small alone, but if they last a long time, they can cause serious problems.

Negative thoughts also build up. If you keep thinking you’re worthless or ugly, you train your brain to see life that way. You get stuck in a bad thought loop. The same thing happens with how you see other people. If you think everyone is mean or selfish, you start seeing that everywhere.

Anger builds up too. Big protests or riots don’t happen because of one thing. They happen because lots of little annoyances and unfair things add up until one event makes people explode with anger.

WHAT PROGRESS REALLY FEELS LIKE

Imagine there’s an ice cube on the table. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It’s 25 degrees.

Then the room slowly starts to warm up.

26 degrees.

27 degrees.

28 degrees.

The ice cube is still there.
