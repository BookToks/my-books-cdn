As this book was being printed, new news about the British Cycling team came out. You can read what I think at atomichabits.com/cycling.

I got really interested and actually did a calculation. Washington, D.C., is about 225 miles from New York City. If you are flying on a big plane like a 747 or an Airbus A380, changing the direction by 3.5 degrees when you leave Los Angeles can make the front of the plane move about 7.2 to 7.6 feet, or around 86 to 92 inches.

This shows that a tiny change in direction can cause a big difference in where you end up.
