If you only fix problems on the surface, they will come back. To really get better, you need to fix problems at the system level. When you improve the inputs, the outputs will improve by themselves.

Problem #3: Goals can limit your happiness.

When you have a goal, you usually think, “I’ll be happy once I reach this goal.” The problem is that this way of thinking makes you keep waiting to be happy until the next thing happens. I’ve done this so many times I lost count. For years, I told myself I would be happy only after I gained 20 pounds of muscle or after my business got into the New York Times.

Also, goals make you think in an “all or nothing” way: either you succeed and feel good, or you fail and feel bad. This traps you into thinking there is only one way to be happy. But life rarely goes exactly as planned. It doesn’t make sense to limit your happiness to just one outcome when there are many ways to succeed.

A system-first mindset helps with this. When you love the process, not just the result, you don’t need to wait to be happy. You can feel good anytime your system is working.

And a system can succeed in many different ways, not just the one you imagined at first.

Problem #4: Goals can hurt your long-term progress.

A goal-focused mindset can make you go back and forth like a yo-yo. For example, many runners train hard for months, but once the race is over, they stop running because the race isn’t there to motivate them anymore. If all your effort is on one goal, what will keep you going after you reach it? That’s why people often go back to old habits after they achieve a goal.

Goals are meant to help you win the game. Systems help you keep playing the game. Real long-term success comes from not just focusing on goals but on improving all the time. It’s about always working to get better. In the end, your progress depends on how much you stick with the process.
