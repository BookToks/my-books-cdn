FIGURE 12: This graph shows someone who started walking for ten minutes after breakfast every day. Notice that the more times they do it, the easier and more automatic it becomes.

One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people should really ask is, “How many times do I need to do it to make it a habit?” In other words, how many times do you need to repeat something before it feels natural?

There’s nothing magical about how much time passes when making a habit. It doesn’t matter if it’s been 21 days, 30 days, or even 300 days.

What really matters is how often you do the behavior. You could do something only twice in 30 days, or 200 times. It’s how often you do it that counts. Your current habits became automatic because you repeated them hundreds or even thousands of times. New habits need the same kind of practice. You have to keep doing it enough times until it becomes part of your routine and you cross the Habit Line.

In real life, it doesn’t matter exactly how long it takes for a habit to feel automatic. What matters is that you keep doing the actions that help you get better. Whether the habit feels automatic or not isn’t the most important thing.

To build a habit, you need to practice it. The best way to make sure you practice is to follow the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy.

The next chapters will show you exactly how to do that.
