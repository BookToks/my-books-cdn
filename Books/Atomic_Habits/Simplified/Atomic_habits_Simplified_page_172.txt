HOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR

Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is super important to stay motivated and feel like you’re winning. In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. But in real life, you’re more likely to enjoy things that come easy to you.

People who are good at something tend to do better at it and get praised for their work. They keep their energy up because they’re improving where others might fail, and they get rewarded with better pay and bigger chances. This makes them happier and pushes them to do even better. It’s like a good cycle.

Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is hard.

So, how do you pick the right habit? The first step is to make it easy. Often, people pick the wrong habit because it’s too hard. When a habit is easy, you’re more likely to succeed. When you succeed, you feel good. But over time, if you keep getting better, even an easy thing can become tough.

At some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your skills. How do you figure that out?

Most people try things out and learn from mistakes. But there’s a problem: life is short. You can’t try every job, date every person, or learn every instrument. Luckily, there’s a smart way to handle this called the explore/exploit trade-off.

At first, when you try something new, you should explore a lot. In relationships, this is dating. In college, it’s trying many subjects. In business, it’s testing different ideas. The goal is to try many options and learn a lot.

After exploring, focus on the best option you found—but still try new things sometimes. Whether you focus more on one thing or keep exploring depends on if you’re winning or losing. If you’re winning, stick to what works. If you’re losing, keep trying new things.

In the long run, the best plan is to spend about 80 to 90 percent of your time on what works and 10 to 20 percent exploring new options. For example, Google asks employees to spend 80 percent of their time on their main job and 20 percent on side projects.
