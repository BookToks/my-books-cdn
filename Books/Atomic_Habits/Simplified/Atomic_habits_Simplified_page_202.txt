Weight-loss plans are always changing. New plans give people hope because we don’t have any past experiences to judge them by. 

New ideas seem better than old ones because they come with endless hope. As Aristotle said, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.” 

Maybe it should be changed to, “Youth is easily tricked because it only hopes.” Young people don’t have experience to back up their hopes. At first, hope is all you have.
