In the late 1990s, a public health worker named Stephen Luby left his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, and bought a one-way ticket to Karachi, Pakistan.

Karachi was one of the biggest cities in the world. By 1998, more than nine million people lived there. It was the economic center of Pakistan and a busy place with airports and seaports. In the busy parts of town, you could find all the usual city things and crowded streets. But Karachi was also one of the hardest cities to live in.

Over 60 percent of Karachiâ€™s people lived in squatter settlements and slums.

These crowded neighborhoods had houses made from old boards, cinder blocks, and other thrown-away materials. There was no garbage pickup, no electricity, and no clean water. When it was dry, the streets were full of dust and trash. When it rained, the streets turned into muddy pools of sewage. Mosquitoes bred in the dirty water, and kids played among the garbage.

The dirty conditions caused a lot of sickness.

Dirty water led to outbreaks of diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Almost one third of the children were not getting enough food to grow properly.

With so many people packed in tight, viruses and bacteria spread fast. This big health problem is why Stephen Luby came to Pakistan.

Luby and his team found out that washing hands could really help in places without good sanitation. But they soon saw that many people already knew washing hands was important.

Still, even with this knowledge, many people washed their hands carelessly. Some would just run their hands under water.
