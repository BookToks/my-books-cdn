Europe and Asia mostly stretch from east to west. The Americas and Africa mostly stretch from north to south. This means the climate changes more when you go up or down in the Americas than when you go across Europe and Asia. Because of this, farming spread almost twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it did in other places. Farmers’ actions, even over many years, were limited by how hard it was to deal with the environment.

The climate changes a lot when you travel from north to south.

Think about how different the weather is in Florida compared to Canada. Even if you’re an amazing farmer, you can’t grow Florida oranges in Canadian winters. Snow isn’t a good replacement for soil. To farm along north-south routes, farmers had to find and grow new plants whenever the climate changed.

Because of this, farming spread two to three times faster across Asia and Europe than it did going up and down the Americas. Over hundreds of years, this small difference made a big impact. More food meant more people could live. With more people, these societies could build stronger armies and create new technologies.

At first, the changes were small—a crop that spread a little farther, a population that grew a little faster—but over time, these small changes added up to big differences.

The way farming spread shows the 3rd Law of Behavior Change on a worldwide level. People often think motivation is what changes habits. Maybe if you really wanted something, you’d do it. But actually, people want to be lazy and do what’s easiest. And despite what self-help books say, this is actually a smart way to live.
