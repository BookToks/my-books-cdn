Diderot got a bright red robe for himself.

His red robe looked amazing. But it also looked weird next to his normal stuff. He said there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his fancy robe and the other things he owned.

Soon, Diderot wanted to upgrade everything he had. He changed his rug to one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive statues. He bought a mirror to put above the fireplace and got a better kitchen table. He threw away his old straw chair and got a leather one instead. One new thing led to buying another.

This kind of behavior is pretty common. It even has a name: the Diderot Effect. It means when you get something new, it often makes you want to buy more things that match it.

You can see this happen all the time. You buy a dress and then want new shoes and earrings to go with it. You buy a couch and start thinking about rearranging your whole living room. You buy a toy for your kid and then end up buying all the extra stuff that goes with it. It’s like a chain reaction of buying things.

A lot of human actions work like this. What you do next often depends on what you just did. For example, after going to the bathroom, you wash and dry your hands. Then you remember the dirty towels need to be washed, so you add detergent to your shopping list, and so on. No action happens alone. Each one reminds you to do the next thing.

Why does this matter?

When you want to build new habits, you can use this connection between actions to help you. One great way to start a new habit is to link it to something you already do every day. This is called habit stacking.

Habit stacking is a special kind of plan. Instead of choosing a time or place to do your new habit, you connect it to a habit you already have. This idea was created by BJ Fogg in his Tiny Habits program. It helps you find a clear reminder for almost any new habit. The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
