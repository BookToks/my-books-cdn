FIGURE 3: There are three levels of behavior change: changing your results, changing your habits, or changing who you are.

The first level is about changing your results. This means getting different outcomes like losing weight, writing a book, or winning a game. Most goals you set fit here.

The second level is about changing your habits and routines. This means doing things differently, like starting a new workout plan, cleaning your desk to work better, or trying meditation.

Most habits you build are part of this level.

The third and deepest level is about changing your identity. This means changing what you believe about yourself and the world, like your self-image and opinions.

Outcomes are what you get. Processes are what you do. Identity is what you believe. When you want to build habits that last and improve slowly, the problem isnâ€™t which level is better. All levels help in their own way. The real issue is which direction you choose to change.

Many people start by focusing on what they want to achieve, which is outcome-based habits. But another way is to build identity-based habits. This means starting by thinking about who you want to become.
