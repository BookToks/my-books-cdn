A craving is just a sign of a deeper reason inside you. Your brain didn’t evolve to want cigarettes, Instagram, or video games. Deep down, you just want to feel less worried, to be accepted by others, or to feel important.

Look at almost any product that people get hooked on. It doesn’t create a new reason for wanting it. Instead, it connects to the natural desires all humans have.

Find love and have kids = using Tinder  
Connect and hang out with others = scrolling Facebook  
Get approval from others = posting on Instagram  
Feel less unsure = searching on Google  
Gain status and respect = playing video games  

Your habits today are just new ways to satisfy old needs. The reasons people act the way they do stay the same, but the habits change depending on the time we live in.

Here’s the cool part: there are many ways to handle the same need. One person might calm down by smoking a cigarette. Another might feel less anxious by going for a run. Your habits aren’t always the best way to fix your problems; they are just the ways you learned. Once you link a habit to a problem you want to solve, you keep doing it.

Habits work on connections. These connections decide if your brain thinks a habit is worth doing again. Like we talked about in the 1st Law, your brain is always learning and noticing clues around you. Every time you spot a clue, your brain guesses what to do next.

Cue: You see the stove is hot.  
Prediction: If I touch it, I’ll get burned, so I shouldn’t touch it.

Cue: The traffic light turns green.  
Prediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll get through safely and move closer to where I want to go, so I should step on the gas.

You see a clue, remember what happened before, and decide what to do next.
