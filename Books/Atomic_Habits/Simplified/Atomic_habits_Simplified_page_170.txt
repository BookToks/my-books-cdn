The obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in my favor? How do I find the chances and habits that suit me?” The first place to look for answers is by understanding your personality.

HOW YOUR PERSONALITY AFFECTS YOUR HABITS  
Your genes work behind the scenes in every habit you have. Actually, they affect every behavior you show. Genes can influence things like how many hours you watch TV, whether you’re likely to get married or divorced, or if you might get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or smoking. They also affect how obedient or rebellious you are with authority, how you handle stress, whether you act quickly or wait to react, and even how interested or bored you feel at events like concerts. 

Robert Plomin, a scientist who studies behavior and genes, said, “We stopped testing if traits come from genes because we can’t find a single one that isn’t influenced by them.” Your unique mix of genetic traits shapes your personality. Personality means the qualities you show that stay pretty much the same in different situations. 

Scientists have studied personality a lot and found the best way to understand it is with the “Big Five.” These are five main types of behavior:

1. Openness to experience: this means being curious and creative or being careful and steady.  
2. Conscientiousness: this means being organized and efficient or easygoing and spontaneous.  
3. Extroversion: this means being outgoing and energetic or quiet and reserved (you probably know these as extroverts and introverts).  
4. Agreeableness: this means being friendly and kind or tough and distant.  
5. Neuroticism: this means being anxious and sensitive or confident, calm, and steady.  

All five traits come from biology. For example, extroversion can be seen even in babies. If scientists make a loud noise near newborns, some babies turn toward it while others look away. When researchers followed these kids as they grew up, they found that the babies who turned toward the noise were more likely to be outgoing later in life.
