I stopped breathing completely. The doctors quickly gave me oxygen and decided the local hospital couldn’t take care of me, so they called a helicopter to fly me to a bigger hospital in Cincinnati.

I was taken out of the emergency room and rolled toward the helipad across the street. The stretcher shook on the rough sidewalk as one nurse pushed me and another helped me breathe by hand. My mom, who had just arrived, got into the helicopter with me. I was still unconscious and couldn’t breathe on my own, but she held my hand during the flight.

While my mom rode with me, my dad went home to check on my brother and sister and tell them what happened. He tried not to cry as he told my sister he would miss her eighth-grade graduation that night. After leaving my siblings with family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my mom.

When we landed on the hospital roof, about twenty doctors and nurses rushed to the helipad and took me to the trauma unit. My brain was very swollen, and I kept having seizures. My broken bones needed fixing, but I was too sick for surgery. After my third seizure that day, they put me in a medically induced coma and put me on a breathing machine.

My parents knew this hospital well. Ten years ago, they came here when my sister was diagnosed with leukemia at age three. I was five then, and my brother was just six months old.

After two and a half years of chemo, spinal taps, and bone marrow tests, my sister finally left the hospital healthy and cancer-free. Now, after ten years of normal life, my parents were back in the same place with me.

While I was in a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social worker to support my parents. It was the same priest who had helped them when my sister got sick.

As the day turned to night, machines kept me alive. My parents tried to sleep on a hospital mattress but kept waking up worried. My mom later said, “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”
