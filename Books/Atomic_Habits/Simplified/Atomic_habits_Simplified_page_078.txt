The Secret to Self-Control

In 1971, when the Vietnam War had been going on for almost sixteen years, two congressmen, Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois, found something surprising. They learned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam were addicted to heroin.

More research showed that 35 percent of soldiers had tried heroin, and up to 20 percent were addicted. The problem was even bigger than they first thought.

She discovered that when soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam came back home, only 5 percent got addicted again within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. So, about nine out of ten soldiers stopped their addiction almost immediately.

This went against what most people thought back then. They believed heroin addiction was permanent and couldn’t be fixed.
