Before you realize it, you’re already moving on to the next thing. It feels easier to keep doing what you’re already doing than to try something new. You sit through a boring movie for two hours. You keep eating snacks even when you’re full. You check your phone for a “second,” but then twenty minutes fly by staring at the screen. The habits you do without thinking often control the choices you make when you are actually thinking.

Every evening, there’s a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—that decides how my night will go. My wife comes home from work and either we change into workout clothes and go to the gym, or we flop on the couch, order Indian food, and watch The Office.* Like Twyla Tharp calling a cab, my ritual is changing into workout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the workout will happen. Everything after that—driving to the gym, picking exercises, lifting weights—is easy once I start.

Every day, there are a few moments that have a big impact. I call these little choices “decisive moments.” Like choosing between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. Choosing whether to drive your car or ride your bike. Choosing to start homework or grab the game controller. These choices are like a fork in the road.
