In the next chapters, we’ll see over and over how the four steps—cue, craving, response, and reward—affect almost everything we do every day. But before that, we need to turn these steps into a simple plan we can use to build good habits and get rid of bad ones.

I call this plan the Four Laws of Behavior Change. It gives easy rules for making good habits and stopping bad ones.

You can think of each law as a tool that changes how people act. When these tools are used right, making good habits is easy. When they’re used wrong, it’s really hard.

How to Make a Good Habit  
1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.  
2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.  
3rd law (Response): Make it easy.  
4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

We can flip these laws to break bad habits.

How to Break a Bad Habit  
Flip 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.  
Flip 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.  
Flip 3rd law (Response): Make it hard.  
Flip 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.

I can’t say these four laws cover everything about changing behavior, but they’re pretty close. You’ll see these laws work in almost every area, like sports, politics, art, medicine, comedy, and managing people.

These laws work no matter what challenge you face. You don’t need different strategies for every habit.

Whenever you want to change how you act, just ask yourself:  
1. How can I make it obvious?  
2. How can I make it attractive?  
3. How can I make it easy?  
4. How can I make it satisfying?

If you’ve ever wondered, “Why don’t I do what I say I will? Why don’t I lose weight, stop smoking, save money, or start that side project? Why do I say something is important but never find time for it?” The answers are all in these four laws.
