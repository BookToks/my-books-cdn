One of the best feelings is knowing you're making progress.

A habit tracker is an easy way to check if you did a habit—like putting an X on a calendar.

Habit trackers and other ways to see your progress can make your habits more enjoyable because you can clearly see how far you’ve come.

Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak going.

Never miss two days in a row. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as soon as you can.

Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.
