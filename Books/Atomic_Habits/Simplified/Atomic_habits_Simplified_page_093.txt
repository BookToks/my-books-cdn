Chapter Summary: The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is to make it attractive.

The more fun or interesting something is, the more likely it is to become a habit.

Habits happen because of a chemical in our brain called dopamine. When dopamine goes up, we feel more motivated to do something.

Itâ€™s not actually getting the reward that makes us act, but looking forward to it. The more excited we are about the reward, the bigger the dopamine boost.

Temptation bundling is a way to make habits more fun.

This means you do something you want to do at the same time as something you need to do.
