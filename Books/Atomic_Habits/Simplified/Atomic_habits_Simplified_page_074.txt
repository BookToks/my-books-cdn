Watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the beers on tap.

We usually connect our habits to the places where they happen: at home, at school, or at the gym. Each place gets linked to certain habits and routines. You get used to the stuff on your desk, the things on your kitchen counter, and the things in your bedroom.

What we do isn’t really about the stuff around us but about how we relate to it. So, instead of thinking about your surroundings as just full of things, think about the relationships you have with those places. For example, one person might always read on their couch for an hour every night. Another person might use the same couch to watch TV and eat ice cream after work. Different people have different habits connected to the same place.

The good news? You can train yourself to connect a habit with a certain place.

In one study, scientists told people with trouble sleeping to only go to bed when they felt tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they had to sit in another room until they felt sleepy. After a while, their brains started to link the bed with sleeping, making it easier to fall asleep quickly. They learned that in bed, they only sleep—not scroll on their phone, watch TV, or stare at the clock.

The power of context shows a great trick: it’s easier to change habits in a new place. You can get away from the little things that remind you to do your old habits. Try a new spot—a different coffee shop, a park bench, or a corner of your room you don’t use much—and start a new routine there.

It’s easier to make a new habit in a new place than to build one where you have old habits around. For example, it’s hard to go to bed early if you always watch TV in your bedroom. It’s tough to study in the living room if that’s where you usually play video games.

But when you leave your normal place, you leave behind old habits. You don’t have to fight the usual reminders, so new habits can grow without problems.

Want to think more creatively? Try working in a bigger room, on a rooftop patio, or in a building with cool design. Take a break from the place where you normally work, since it’s tied to your usual thoughts.
