When I visited Japan, I saw something that saved a woman’s life. Her young son stepped onto the Shinkansen, one of Japan’s famous bullet trains that go over two hundred miles per hour, just as the doors were closing. She was left outside on the platform and stuck her arm through the door to grab him.

Her arm got stuck in the door, and the train was about to leave. But right before it pulled away, an employee did a safety check by pointing and calling up and down the platform. In less than five seconds, he saw the woman and stopped the train from leaving.

The door opened, the woman—now crying—ran to her son, and a minute later the train left safely.
