A strong feeling of wanting something starts the process. For someone who doesn’t usually gamble, the sounds of a casino are just noise. These signals don’t mean much until you give them meaning. Your thoughts and feelings turn these signals into a strong desire.

The next step is the response. This is the habit you actually do, which can be a thought or an action. Whether you do it depends on how motivated you are and how hard it is to do. If something takes more effort than you want to give, you won’t do it. Your ability also matters. For example, if you want to dunk a basketball but can't jump high enough, you just can’t do it.

Finally, the response gives you a reward. Rewards are the goal of every habit. The signal is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting it. The response is about getting it. We go after rewards because they do two things: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

First, rewards satisfy your craving. Rewards give you benefits by themselves. Food and water give you energy to live. Getting a promotion means more money and respect. Getting in shape helps your health and makes you more attractive. But the main thing is that rewards make you feel satisfied and stop your craving for a while.

Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth doing again in the future.

Your brain looks for rewards. As you live your life, your senses keep track of which actions make you happy or disappointed. These feelings help your brain learn which actions are good or bad.

Rewards finish the habit cycle.

If any of the four steps isn’t strong enough, the habit won’t form. If you remove the signal, the habit won’t start. If you reduce the craving, you won’t be motivated to act. If the action is too hard, you can’t do it. And if the reward isn’t satisfying, you won’t do it again. Without the first three steps, the habit won’t happen. Without all four, it won’t stick.

This is the habit loop.
