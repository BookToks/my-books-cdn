This is the opposite of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Instead of making something obvious, you make it invisible. I’m often surprised by how well simple changes like this work. If you remove just one reminder, the whole habit often goes away.

Self-control only works for a little while, not forever. You might be able to say no once or twice, but it’s hard to keep doing that all the time. Instead of trying to use willpower every time you want to do the right thing, it’s better to change your surroundings.

This is the secret to self-control: make the signs of your good habits easy to see and hide the signs of your bad habits.
