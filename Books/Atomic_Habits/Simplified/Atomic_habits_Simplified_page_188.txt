Players on his team were rated by comparing them to others on the roster. Good, steady players usually scored around 600, while top players scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who had 138 triple-doubles in his career, often scored over 1,000. The Lakers also focused on improving each year by comparing current data to past seasons. Riley said, “We compared November 1986 to November 1985 to show players if they were doing better or worse. Then we compared December 1986 to November 1986.” The Lakers started using CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they won the NBA championship. The next year, Pat Riley led them to another title, making the Lakers the first team in twenty years to win back-to-back championships. He said, “Keeping up your effort is the most important thing. To be successful, you have to learn how to do things right and then do them the same way every time.” The CBE program is a great example of how reflecting and reviewing your actions can help you improve.

The Lakers were already good players. CBE helped them use their skills better and made sure they kept getting better instead of worse.

Top performers in many areas reflect and review their work, and it doesn’t have to be complicated. Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge, one of the best marathoners ever and an Olympic gold medalist, takes notes after every practice. He looks at his training and thinks about what he can improve. Gold medal swimmer Katie Ledecky also keeps track of how she feels on a scale from 1 to 10, plus notes about her food and sleep. She also writes down other swimmers’ times. Her coach reviews her notes every week and adds his own thoughts.

It’s not just athletes who do this. Comedian Chris Rock tests new jokes by performing at small clubs many times. He brings a notepad on stage to write down which jokes work and which don’t. The best jokes become the main parts of his new show.

I know business leaders and investors who keep a “decision journal” to write down the important choices they make each week, why they made them, and...
