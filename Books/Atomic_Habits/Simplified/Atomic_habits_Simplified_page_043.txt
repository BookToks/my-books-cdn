HOW HABITS WORK

Building a habit happens in four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. 

Knowing these steps helps us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to make it better.

First, there is the cue. The cue is a signal that tells your brain to start a behavior. It’s like a hint that a reward is coming. Long ago, people noticed cues that meant food, water, or safety was nearby. Now, we notice cues that mean things like money, praise, love, or feeling good are coming. Your brain is always looking for these hints because they tell you a reward is close. When you see a cue, it makes you want something, which leads to a craving.

Cravings are the second step. They are the reason you do a habit. You don’t just do a habit for no reason—you want the change it brings. For example, you don’t crave smoking a cigarette itself; you crave the feeling it gives you, like relief. You don’t want to brush your teeth just to brush them—you want the clean feeling afterward. You don’t want to turn on the TV just to watch it—you want to be entertained. Cravings are all about wanting to feel different inside.

This is really important, and we’ll talk more about it later.

Cravings are different for everyone. In theory, anything could make you crave something, but in real life, people don’t all react to the same cues. For example, a gambler might get excited by the sound of slot machines, but someone else might not.
