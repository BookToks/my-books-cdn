She was one of the best chess players in the world. At just fifteen years and four months old, she became the youngest grandmaster ever—beating Bobby Fischer’s old record. For twenty-seven years, she was the top female chess player worldwide.

The Polgar sisters had a pretty unusual childhood. But when you ask them about it, they say it was actually fun. In interviews, they describe their childhood as exciting, not hard. They loved playing chess and couldn’t get enough of it. One time, Laszlo found Sofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.

He told her, “Sofia, go back to sleep and leave the pieces alone!” She answered, “Daddy, they won’t leave me alone!” The sisters grew up in a place where chess was everything—people praised them and rewarded them for it. In their world, being obsessed with chess was normal. And, as we’ll see, the habits that are normal in your culture are often the most attractive ones.

Humans are social animals. We want to fit in, make friends, and get respect from others. These feelings are important for our survival.

For most of history, people lived in tribes. If you were separated or kicked out, it was very dangerous. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.” People who worked well with others stayed safer, had more chances to find mates, and got better access to food. Charles Darwin said, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” So, one of our strongest wants is to belong. This old need still affects how we act today.

We don’t pick our first habits; we copy them. We follow what our family, friends, church, school, and community teach us. Each group has its own rules—like when to get married, how many kids to have, which holidays to celebrate, or how much to spend on a birthday. These social rules are like invisible guides for how we act every day. You think about them even if you’re not always aware. Most of the time, you follow your culture’s habits without even realizing it or questioning them.
