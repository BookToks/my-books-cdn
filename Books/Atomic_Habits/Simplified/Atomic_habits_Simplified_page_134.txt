Habits can happen in just a few seconds but still affect what you do for minutes or even hours after.

Many habits happen at important moments—like making a choice that can lead to either a good, productive day or a bad, unproductive one.

The Two-Minute Rule says, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you make the start of a habit a regular thing, the easier it is to get into a deep focus needed to do great work.

Focus on making a habit a regular thing before trying to make it better. You can't improve a habit that doesn’t even exist.
