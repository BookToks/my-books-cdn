Habit stacking already includes the time and place for your habits. When and where you add a habit in your daily routine really matters. If you want to meditate in the morning but your mornings are busy and your kids keep coming in, then that might not be the best time or place. Think about when you’re most likely to succeed. Don’t try to do a habit when you’ll probably be busy with something else.

Your cue, or reminder, should happen as often as you want the habit to happen. If you want to do something every day but connect it to a habit that only happens on Mondays, that won’t work well.

One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by making a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits Scorecard from the last chapter to help. Or, you can make a list with two columns. In the first column, write down habits you do every day without missing. For example: Get out of bed.

Take a shower.

Brush your teeth.

Get dressed.

Brew a cup of coffee.

Eat breakfast.

Take the kids to school.

Start the work day.

Eat lunch.

End the work day.

Change out of work clothes.

Sit down for dinner.

Turn off the lights.

Get into bed.

Your list can be longer, but this shows the idea. In the second column, write down things that happen to you every day without fail. For example: The sun rises.

You get a text message.
