You know how annoying it is when your mind keeps getting distracted? But actually, each time you get distracted, it’s a chance to practice bringing your focus back to your breath. Distractions are good because they help you get better at meditation.

Before a big event, lots of people feel nervous. Their breathing gets faster, their heart beats quicker, and they feel more awake. If you think of these feelings as bad, you get tense and stressed. But if you see them as good, you can stay calm and handle things better. Instead of saying “I’m nervous,” try saying “I’m excited and my body is getting ready to help me focus.” Changing how you think like this can change how you feel.

You can also make a motivation ritual. This means linking something you like with a habit so you get motivated when you do it. For example, if you always play a certain song before having sex, you’ll start to connect that music with feeling in the mood. So when you want to get in the mood, just play the song.

Ed Latimore, a boxer and writer, found this out without meaning to. He said, “I noticed my focus gets better just by putting on my headphones when I write. I don’t even need to play music.” At first, he put on headphones and listened to music while working. After doing this many times, just putting on headphones made him focus better. It became a habit.

Athletes use similar tricks to get ready to perform.

When I played baseball, I had a special warm-up before every game. I stretched and threw the ball for about ten minutes, doing it the same way each time. This not only warmed me up physically but also helped me get into the right mindset. Doing this routine made me feel competitive and focused. Even if I didn’t feel like it before, after my warm-up I was ready to play. You can use this idea for anything. If you want to feel happier, find something that makes you happy—like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath. Then make a short routine you do before the happy thing, like taking three deep breaths and smiling.

Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Do it again.
