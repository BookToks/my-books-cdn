How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

A psychologist named Edward Thorndike did an experiment in 1898 that helped us understand how habits form and how we behave. Thorndike wanted to study how animals act, so he worked with cats.

He put each cat inside a special box called a puzzle box. The box was made so the cat could get out by doing something simple, like pulling a cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform. For example, one box had a lever that, when pressed, opened a door. Once the door opened, the cat could run out to get some food.

Most cats tried to escape as soon as they were put in the box. They poked around, stuck their paws through holes, and scratched things. After some time, the cats accidentally pressed the lever, the door opened, and they escaped.

Thorndike watched each cat many times. At first, the cats moved around randomly. But after they pressed the lever and escaped, they started to learn.

Slowly, each cat realized that pressing the lever meant they could get out and eat food.

After 20 to 30 tries, this became a habit, and the cats could escape in just a few seconds. For example, Thorndike said one cat took these times to escape: 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7. At first, the cat took about 1.5 minutes to escape.

At the end, it only took about 6.3 seconds to escape. With practice, the cats made fewer mistakes and got faster. Instead of making the same mistakes, the cat learned to go straight to the lever.
