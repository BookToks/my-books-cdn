Measuring something is only helpful when it guides you and helps you see the bigger picture, not when it takes over your life. Each number is just one piece of feedback in the whole system.

Today, we often put too much value on numbers and ignore things that are hard to measure. We think only things we can count really matter. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter.

That’s why it’s important to keep habit tracking in its right place. It can feel good to record a habit and see your progress, but the numbers aren’t everything. There are many ways to see progress, and sometimes it helps to focus on something different.

For example, in weight loss, the number on the scale might not change much. If you only focus on that, you might lose motivation. But you could notice your skin looks better, you wake up earlier, or your energy is higher. These are all good ways to see progress. If the scale number isn’t motivating you, try looking at other signs that you’re improving.

No matter how you measure your progress, tracking your habits can make them more satisfying. Each measurement shows you’re moving forward and gives you a little moment of happiness for doing well.
