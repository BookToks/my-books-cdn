Introduction My Story

One day during my sophomore year of high school, I got hit in the face with a baseball bat. My classmate swung hard, but the bat slipped and flew right at me, hitting me between the eyes. I don’t remember the moment it hit me.

The bat hit my face so hard it crushed my nose into a weird U-shape. The hit also made my brain slam against the inside of my skull. Right away, my head started swelling up fast. In just a second, I had a broken nose, cracked skull, and two broken eye sockets.

When I opened my eyes, I saw people staring and running to help me.

I looked down and saw red spots on my clothes. One classmate took off his shirt and gave it to me. I used it to stop the blood coming from my broken nose. I was shocked and confused and didn’t realize how badly I was hurt.

My teacher put his arm around me, and we slowly walked to the nurse’s office. We crossed the field, walked down a hill, and went back inside school. People touched me to keep me steady. We were moving slow, but no one knew that every minute was really important.

When we got to the nurse’s office, she asked me some questions.

“What year is it?” “1998,” I said. It was actually 2002.

“Who is the president of the United States?” “Bill Clinton,” I said. The real answer was George W. Bush.

“What is your mom’s name?” “Uh. Um.” I hesitated for ten seconds.

“Patti,” I finally said like it was no big deal, even though it took me so long to remember.

That’s the last thing I remember. My brain was swelling too fast, and I passed out before the ambulance came.

A few minutes later, they carried me out of school and took me to the hospital.

Soon after getting there, my body started to shut down. I had trouble doing simple things like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of the day. Then I...

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
