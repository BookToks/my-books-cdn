Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting. This is the idea behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.” If you want more than you like, you’ll never feel satisfied. You’ll always think the problem is bigger than the solution.

Happiness depends on your situation. When I first started sharing my writing, it took me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I reached that number, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt excited and motivated. But a few years later, I saw that one thousand people were signing up every day.

Still, I didn’t even tell anyone. It felt normal. I was doing ninety times better than before but didn’t enjoy it much. A few days later, I realized it was crazy that I wasn’t celebrating something that seemed impossible just a few years earlier.

The pain of failure depends on how much you expect. When you really want something, it hurts more if you don’t get it. Failing to reach a big goal hurts more than failing at something you didn’t care much about. That’s why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.” Feelings happen before and after you do something. Before acting, there’s a feeling that pushes you—the craving. After acting, there’s a feeling that teaches you to do it again—the reward.

Cue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling). How you feel affects what you do, and what you do affects how you feel.

Desire starts the action. Pleasure keeps it going. Wanting and liking are why we do things. If you don’t want to do something, you won’t do it. Desire makes you start, but if it’s not fun, you won’t keep doing it.

Pleasure and satisfaction help you keep going. Feeling motivated makes you act. Feeling successful makes you want to do it again.

Hope goes down with experience and is replaced by acceptance. The first time you get a chance, you hope for what might happen. Your expectations are based only on what you imagine. The next time, your expectations are based on what really happens. You start to understand how things work, and your hope turns into a more realistic idea of what will probably happen.

This is one reason why people keep chasing the newest get-rich-quick or
