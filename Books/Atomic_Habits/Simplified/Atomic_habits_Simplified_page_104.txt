You might think you're quitting something, but really, you're not quitting anything because cigarettes don’t do anything good for you.

You might believe smoking helps you be social, but it doesn’t. You can hang out and have fun without smoking at all.

WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM Every action you do has a surface craving and a deeper reason behind it. For example, I might say, “I want to eat tacos.” If you ask why, I wouldn’t say, “Because I need food to survive.” But deep down, the real reason is that I need to eat to stay alive. The deeper motive is to get food and water, even if what I want is tacos.

Some of our deeper reasons include: saving energy, getting food and water, finding love and having kids, connecting with others, fitting in and being accepted, reducing uncertainty, and gaining status and respect.
