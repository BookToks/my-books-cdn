For most of my young life, being an athlete was a big part of who I was.

After my baseball career ended, I had a hard time figuring out who I was. When you spend your whole life seeing yourself one way and that changes, it’s confusing to know who you are now.

Military veterans and people who used to run their own businesses feel the same way. If you think of yourself as “I’m a great soldier,” what happens when you stop serving? For business owners, their identity might be “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.” If you spent all your time working on your business, how will you feel after you sell it?

The best way to deal with losing that part of your identity is to change how you see yourself so you keep the important parts, even if your role changes.

So, “I’m an athlete” can become “I’m someone who is mentally strong and loves physical challenges.” “I’m a great soldier” can change to “I’m someone who is disciplined, reliable, and works well with others.” “I’m the CEO” can mean “I’m someone who builds and creates things.” When you pick your identity this way, it can bend and change like water instead of breaking.

There’s a quote from the Tao Te Ching that explains this perfectly: People start out soft and flexible; when they die, they become stiff and hard.

Plants are soft and bendy when alive; dead, they get brittle and dry.

So, being stiff and unchanging leads to death.

Being soft and flexible leads to life.

The hard and stiff will break.

The soft and flexible will survive.
