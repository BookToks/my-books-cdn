The amygdala and parts of the prefrontal cortex are important for wanting things. The parts of the brain that make us like things are much smaller. These are called “hedonic hot spots” and are spread out like tiny islands in the brain. For example, when we really want something, 100% of a part called the nucleus accumbens is active. But when we just like something, only 10% of it is active.

The brain spends a lot of space on the areas that make us crave and desire stuff. This shows how important wanting is. Desire is like the engine that drives everything we do. We act because we expect something good to happen. It’s the craving that makes us take action.

This is why the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is so important. We need to make habits attractive because looking forward to a reward is what makes us do things. This is where temptation bundling helps.

HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS MORE ATTRACTIVE Ronan Byrne, a student in Dublin, loved watching Netflix but knew he should exercise more. Using his engineering skills, he connected his stationary bike to his laptop and TV. He wrote a program so Netflix only worked if he cycled fast enough. If he slowed down, the show paused until he pedaled again. People said he was “eliminating obesity one Netflix binge at a time.” He used temptation bundling by combining something he wanted to do (watch Netflix) with something he needed to do (exercise).

Businesses are really good at temptation bundling. For example, in 2014, ABC made a Thursday night TV event. Every Thursday, they showed three popular shows by Shonda Rhimes: Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away with Murder.

They called it “TGIT on ABC” which means Thank God It’s Thursday.
