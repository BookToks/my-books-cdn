FIGURE 4: Outcome-based habits mean focusing on what you want to achieve. Identity-based habits mean focusing on who you want to become.

Imagine two people trying not to smoke a cigarette. When offered one, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” This sounds okay, but this person still thinks of themselves as a smoker who wants to change. They hope their actions will change, but their beliefs stay the same.

The second person says, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” This small change in words shows a big change in how they see themselves. Smoking used to be part of their life, but now it’s not. They don’t think of themselves as someone who smokes anymore.

Most people don’t think about changing who they are when they try to get better. They just say, “I want to be skinny (outcome), and if I follow this diet (process), then I’ll be skinny.” They make goals and plan what to do.
