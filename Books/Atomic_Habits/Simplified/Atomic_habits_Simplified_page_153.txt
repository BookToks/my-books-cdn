HOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK

A habit tracker is an easy way to check if you did a habit. The simplest way is to get a calendar and mark an X on each day you follow your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, you put an X on those days. As time goes on, the calendar shows how long your habit streak lasts.

Many people have used habit trackers, but one of the most famous was Benjamin Franklin. When he was twenty, Franklin carried a small notebook everywhere. He tracked thirteen personal goals, like “Don’t waste time” and “Avoid useless talk.” Every day, he would open his notebook and write down how he did.

Jerry Seinfeld also uses a habit tracker to keep writing jokes every day. In the documentary Comedian, he says his goal is to “never break the chain” of writing jokes daily. He doesn’t worry about how good or bad a joke is or if he feels inspired. He just focuses on doing it and keeping his streak going.

“Don’t break the chain” is a strong idea. Don’t stop making sales calls, and you’ll build a good business. Don’t stop working out, and you’ll get fit faster. Don’t stop creating every day, and you’ll have an awesome portfolio. Habit tracking works well because it uses several smart behavior tricks. It makes your habit clear, tempting, and rewarding.

Let’s explain each part.

Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.

Writing down what you did creates a reminder to do it again. Habit tracking makes a visual cue, like a row of X’s on your calendar or a list of meals you ate. When you see your streak, you get a nudge to keep going. Studies show people who track their progress with goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, or lowering blood pressure do better than those who don’t.

One study with over sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who didn’t. Just keeping track can make you want to change.

Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us think we do better than we really do. Measuring your habits helps you see the truth.
