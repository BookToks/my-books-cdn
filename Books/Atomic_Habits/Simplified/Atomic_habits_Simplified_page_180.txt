The main idea of the Goldilocks Rule is that working on challenges that are just hard enough—right at the edge of what you can do—is really important to keep you motivated.

Getting better takes a careful balance. You need to keep finding challenges that push you but still let you make progress so you don’t lose motivation. You also need variety because doing the same thing all the time gets boring. And boredom is one of the biggest problems when you’re trying to improve yourself.

HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON YOUR GOALS

After my baseball career ended, I wanted to try a new sport. I joined a weightlifting team, and one day a top coach came to our gym. He had worked with thousands of athletes, including some Olympians. I introduced myself, and we started talking about how people get better.

I asked, “What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?”

He talked about things like genetics, luck, and talent, which I expected. But then he said something surprising: “At some point, it’s about who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts again and again.” This shocked me because it’s a different way to think about work ethic. People often say you need to be super excited or passionate about your goals. But this coach said that even the best people get bored or lose motivation sometimes. The difference is they still keep showing up and working hard, no matter what.

Getting really good at something takes practice. But the more you practice, the more boring it can get. After you learn the basics, your interest can start to fade quickly. For example, if you go to the gym a few days in a row or post blog posts on time, missing one day might not seem like a big deal.

Things can be going well, so it’s easy to tell yourself it’s okay to take a day off because you’re doing fine.
