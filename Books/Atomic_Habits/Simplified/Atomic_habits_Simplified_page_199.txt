Sometimes we want to look a certain way or have something, but we don’t know if it will actually make us happy. The feeling of happiness usually comes after we get what we want. This is what Victor Frankl, a smart doctor, meant when he said happiness can’t be chased directly; it happens after we go after what we want.

Pleasure happens after we do something.

Peace comes when you don’t turn what you see or notice into a problem. The first step before doing anything is to notice something. If you don’t feel like you have to act on what you see, then you feel calm and peaceful.

Craving means wanting to fix everything. But if you just notice things without wanting to change them, it means you realize nothing needs to be fixed. Your desires aren’t controlling you. You don’t want to change how things are. You’re just watching and being.

If you have a strong enough reason to do something, you can get through any challenge. Friedrich Nietzsche, a famous thinker, said, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This means if your reason for doing something is big enough, you’ll keep going even when it’s hard. Strong desire can push you to act, even when things are tough.

Being curious is more important than being smart. Wanting to learn and do things is better than just being smart because it makes you take action. Being smart alone won’t get things done because it doesn’t make you move. It’s desire, not just intelligence, that makes you act. Naval Ravikant said, “The trick to doing anything is first wanting to do it.” Feelings drive what we do. Every choice is based on feelings in some way. Even if you have good reasons to do something, you only act because you feel like it. Some people who can’t feel emotions might know why they should do things but still won’t do them. That’s because feelings come before actions. You feel something first, then you do something.

We can only think clearly after we feel first. Our brain works mostly by feeling, then by thinking. The first quick part of the brain reacts with feelings and guesses. The second slower part thinks carefully. Psychologists call this System 1 (feelings and quick decisions) and System 2 (slow, logical thinking). Feelings happen first, and logic comes later. This is good when they agree, but it causes problems when they don’t.

Your actions usually follow your feelings. What you do depends more on what you like or feel attracted to, not always on what makes sense.
