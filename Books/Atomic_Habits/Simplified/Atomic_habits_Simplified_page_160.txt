During World War II, Roger Fisher was a pilot. After that, he went to Harvard Law School and spent 34 years learning about negotiation and solving conflicts.

He started the Harvard Negotiation Project and worked with countries and world leaders to solve problems like peace talks, hostage situations, and agreements between nations. But in the 1970s and 1980s, when the threat of nuclear war was high, Fisher came up with a very interesting idea.

He was trying to find ways to stop nuclear war and noticed something scary. Any president could launch nuclear weapons that could kill millions, but the president would never actually see the damage because they were far away.

Fisher suggested something simple in 1981. He said to put the nuclear launch codes inside a small capsule and put that capsule inside a volunteer’s body near their heart. This volunteer would carry a big knife and stay with the president. If the president wanted to launch nuclear weapons, they would have to kill the volunteer first with their own hands. The president would have to face the reality of killing one person before causing millions of deaths.

When Fisher told people in the Pentagon about this, they said it was terrible because having to kill someone might stop the president from making the decision. This idea goes against the 4th Law of Behavior Change, which says good habits should feel good right away. Fisher’s idea is the opposite: make the action feel bad right away.

Just like we want to do things that feel good at the end, we try to avoid things that end badly.
