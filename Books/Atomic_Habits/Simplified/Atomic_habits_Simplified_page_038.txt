But the real question is: “Are you becoming the kind of person you want to be?” The first step isn’t about what to do or how to do it, but about who you want to be. You need to know who you want to become. If you don’t, trying to change is like a boat without a steering wheel. That’s why we’re starting here.

You have the power to change what you believe about yourself. Your identity isn’t fixed. Every moment, you get to choose. You can decide who you want to be by the habits you pick today. This is the main idea of this book and why habits really matter.

Making better habits isn’t about doing random life hacks. It’s not about flossing one tooth every night, taking cold showers every morning, or wearing the same clothes daily. It’s also not just about things like making more money, losing weight, or feeling less stressed. Habits can help with these, but really, they’re about becoming a certain kind of person.

In the end, your habits matter because they help you become who you want to be. They shape what you truly believe about yourself. Basically, you become your habits.
