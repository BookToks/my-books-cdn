CHAPTER 1

At first, Great Britain only won one gold medal in cycling at the Olympic Games. 

Big bike companies in Europe didn’t want to sell bikes to the British team. 

Dave Brailsford and his coaches started making small changes to improve the team. 

They even painted the inside of their team truck white to help keep everything clean and bright. 

Just five years after Brailsford took over, British cyclists won 57% of the cycling medals at the 2008 Olympics. Out of 14 gold medals, they won eight. 

The British team got even better and set new world and Olympic records at the 2012 Olympics. 

Bradley Wiggins was the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. 

Chris Froome also won the Tour de France later on. 

Between 2007 and 2017, the British cycling team won a lot of medals at world championships, the Olympics, and the Paralympics. 

Small improvements add up a lot over time. If you improve by just a little bit every day, you can be way better after a while. 

Habits work like compound interest, meaning they grow bigger and stronger the longer you keep them up. 

Doing one extra thing every day can make a huge difference over many years. 

Habits can be good or bad, depending on what you do regularly.  

The more things you do automatically without thinking, the more time and energy you have for other stuff. 

Every book you read can make your old ideas better and more useful. 

Cancer can hide in your body for a long time before you notice it.  

The San Antonio Spurs are a famous basketball team known for working hard and being consistent. 

This drawing was inspired by a tweet about how linear growth is different from exponential growth. 

Every habit starts with a single choice. 

What really separates winners from losers isn’t just the goal itself. 

You perform based on your systems and training, not just your hopes or expectations.
