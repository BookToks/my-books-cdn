They made improvements in small and unexpected areas. They tried different massage gels to find out which helped muscles recover fastest. They got a surgeon to teach each rider how to wash their hands properly to avoid catching colds. They figured out the best pillow and mattress for each rider to get the best sleep. They even painted the inside of the team truck white so they could see tiny dust spots that might harm the performance of their bikes.

As these and many other small changes added up, the results came faster than anyone expected.

Just five years after Brailsford took charge, the British Cycling team won big at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, earning 60 percent of the gold medals. Four years later, at the London Olympics, they broke nine Olympic records and seven world records.

That same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome won it, and then again in 2015, 2016, and 2017. This gave the British team five Tour de France wins in six years.

From 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships, 66 Olympic or Paralympic gold medals, and five Tour de France victories. This is seen as the most successful time ever in cycling. How did this happen? How did a team of normal athletes become world champions by making tiny changes that seemed small at first? Why do small improvements add up to huge results, and how can you use this idea in your own life?

WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE

We often think one big moment is the key to success and forget how important small daily improvements are. We tell ourselves that huge success needs huge actions.

Whether you want to lose weight, start a business, write a book, win a championship, or reach any goal, we feel like we need to make a huge change that everyone will notice.

But improving by just 1 percent might not seem like a big deal—it might even go unnoticed—but over time, it can mean a lot more.
