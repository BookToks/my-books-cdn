Notes: I have included a detailed list of notes, references, and sources for each chapter in the book. I hope most readers will find this list enough.

But I know that science changes over time, so the references in this book might need updating. Also, I expect that I made a mistake somewhereâ€”like giving credit to the wrong person or missing someone who deserves it.

If you think this happened, please email me at james@jamesclear.com so I can fix it quickly. Besides the notes below, you can find a full list of updated notes and corrections at atomichabits.com/endnotes.

My name is Sandeep Gautam.
