FIGURE 14: The difference between a good day and a bad day often comes down to a few smart and healthy choices made at important times. Each choice is like a fork in the road, and these decisions add up during the day, leading to very different results.

Important moments decide what options you’ll have later. For example, walking into a restaurant is an important moment because it decides what you’ll eat for lunch. You can choose what to order, but only from what’s on the menu. If you go to a steakhouse, you can get a sirloin or rib eye, but not sushi. Your choices depend on what’s available, which is shaped by your first decision.

We’re limited by where our habits take us. That’s why controlling these important moments during your day matters a lot. Each day has many moments, but a few regular choices really decide the path you follow. These small choices add up, each one shaping how you spend the next part of your day.
