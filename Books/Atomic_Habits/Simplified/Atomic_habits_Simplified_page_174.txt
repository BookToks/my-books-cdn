When have you ever felt truly alive? When did you feel like the real you? No worrying about what others think or doubting yourself. Just feeling connected and having fun. When you feel real and true to yourself, you’re on the right path.

Honestly, some of this depends on luck. People like Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to have special talents and to be in the perfect place to use them. We all have limited time on Earth, and the really successful people work hard but also get lucky with chances that fit them.

But what if you don’t want to just rely on luck?

If you can’t find a situation where you have an advantage, make your own.

Scott Adams, the person who made Dilbert, says, “Everyone has a few things they can be really good at with some effort. I can draw better than most, but I’m not a great artist. I’m not funnier than top comedians, but I’m funnier than most people. The special thing is that not many people can both draw and write jokes. And I know business stuff too, which most cartoonists don’t. This mix makes me unique.” When you can’t win by being the best, you can win by being different. Mixing your skills lowers the competition, so it’s easier to stand out. You don’t always need natural talent or years of practice if you change the rules. A good player works hard at the usual game. A great player makes a new game that fits their strengths and hides their weaknesses.

In college, I made my own major called biomechanics, which mixed physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn’t smart enough to be the best in just physics or biology, so I made my own path. Since I took classes I liked, studying didn’t feel like a pain. It was also easier not to compare myself to others because no one else had my exact class mix. So, who could say who was better?

Focusing on one special skill is a strong way to beat bad luck in your genes.

The more you get really good at something, the harder it is for others to beat you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than arm wrestlers, but a bodybuilder might still lose an arm wrestling match because arm wrestling needs special skills.
