This can mess up how we make decisions too. Our brain makes dangers seem worse if they look like they could happen right now, even if they probably won't: like your plane crashing during some turbulence, a burglar breaking in when you're home alone, or a terrorist bombing the bus you're on.

At the same time, it ignores dangers that seem far away but are actually very real: like gaining fat from eating unhealthy food, losing muscle because you sit too much, or clutter piling up when you donâ€™t clean your room.
