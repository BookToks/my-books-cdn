This all happens really fast, but it’s super important for your habits because every action you take starts with a guess about what will happen next. Life seems like you’re just reacting, but actually, you’re predicting what’s going to happen all the time. All day long, you’re trying to figure out the best way to act based on what you just saw and what worked before. You’re always guessing what’s coming next.

Our behavior depends a lot on these guesses. In other words, how we act depends more on how we understand what’s happening to us, not just what’s really happening. Two people can see the same cigarette, but one might want to smoke it while the other hates the smell. The same thing can start a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The real cause of your habits is actually the guess you make right before.

These guesses cause feelings, which is what we usually call a craving—a feeling, a want, or a strong urge. Feelings and emotions turn the things we notice and the guesses we make into signals that tell us what to do. They help explain what we’re feeling right now. For example, maybe you notice if you’re warm or cold at this moment. If the temperature drops a little, you probably won’t do anything. But if it drops a lot, you’ll feel cold and put on a jacket. Feeling cold is the signal that makes you act. You’ve been feeling the temperature all along, but only when you guess that you’d feel better in a different way do you actually do something.

A craving is the feeling that something is missing. It’s wanting to change how you feel inside. When it gets colder, there’s a difference between what your body feels now and what it wants to feel. This difference gives you a reason to do something.

Desire is the gap between where you are now and where you want to be. Even the smallest action is about wanting to feel different than you do right now. When you binge-eat, smoke, or scroll social media, you don’t just want the food, cigarette, or likes. What you really want is to feel different inside.

Our feelings and emotions tell us if we should stay the same or change. They help us decide what to do next. Scientists have found that if our feelings don’t work right, we can’t make good decisions. We don’t get signals about what’s good or bad. As the brain expert Antonio Damasio says, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.” So, the cravings you feel and the habits you have are really trying to meet your basic needs and feelings.
