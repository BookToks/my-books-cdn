I know Michael Phelps, who is thought to be one of the best athletes ever. He has won more Olympic medals than any swimmer and more than any athlete in any sport.

Not many people know Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was an amazing athlete too. He is a runner from Morocco with two Olympic gold medals and is one of the best middle-distance runners ever. For many years, he held the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, he won gold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races.

These two athletes are very different. For one, Phelps swims and El Guerrouj runs. They are also very different in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall, and Phelps is six feet, four inches tall. But they have one thing in common: they wear the same length inseam on their pants.

How is that possible? Phelps has shorter legs and a longer torso, which is great for swimming. El Guerrouj has very long legs and a short upper body, perfect for running long distances.

Now, imagine if these two switched sports. Could Phelps become a top runner if he trained hard? Probably not. When he was in his best shape, Phelps weighed 194 pounds, which is 40% heavier than El Guerrouj, who was very light at 138 pounds. Taller runners weigh more, and extra weight makes running long distances much harder. So, Phelps would struggle a lot in running.

Also, even though El Guerrouj is an amazing runner, itâ€™s unlikely he could be a top swimmer because their bodies are built for different sports.
