In simple terms, making an implementation intention means saying: “When situation X happens, I will do response Y.” Lots of studies show that these plans really help us stick to our goals, like writing down exactly when you’ll get a flu shot or when your doctor appointment is. They make it more likely that people will keep habits like recycling, studying, going to bed early, or quitting smoking.

Researchers found that more people vote when they have to make a clear plan by answering questions like: “What way will you take to the polling place? What time will you go? What bus will you take?” Other government programs also help by making people plan when and where to pay their taxes or late traffic tickets.

The main point is: people who make a clear plan about when and where they will do a new habit are more likely to actually do it. Lots of people try to change habits without these details. We say, “I’ll eat healthier” or “I’ll write more,” but don’t say when or where. We just hope we’ll remember or feel like it. An implementation intention turns vague ideas like “I want to work out more” or “I should vote” into a clear plan.

Many think they don’t have enough motivation, but really they just don’t have a clear plan.

It’s not always easy to know when and where to act. Some people wait forever for the “right time” to change.

But once you’ve made a plan, you don’t have to wait to feel inspired. For example, do I write a chapter today or not? Do I meditate in the morning or at lunch? When the time comes, just follow your plan without thinking too much.

To use this idea, fill in this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

Example: Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.
