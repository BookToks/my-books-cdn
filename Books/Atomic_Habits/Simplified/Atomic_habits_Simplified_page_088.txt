When you get a reward, your brain's reward system lights up. But the same part of your brain also lights up when you are just waiting for a reward.  

This is why sometimes looking forward to something feels even better than actually getting it.  

For example, as a kid, thinking about Christmas morning can feel more exciting than actually opening the presents.  

As an adult, dreaming about a vacation coming up can be more fun than being on the vacation itself.  

Scientists call this the difference between "wanting" something and "liking" it.
