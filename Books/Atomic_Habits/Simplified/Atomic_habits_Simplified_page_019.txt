If you save a little money now, you still won’t be a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still not in great shape. If you study Mandarin for one hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the whole language. We make some changes, but the results don’t come fast, so we go back to our old habits.

The slow change also makes it easy to keep bad habits. If you eat unhealthy food today, the scale won’t change much. If you work late and ignore your family, they usually forgive you. If you put off your project until tomorrow, there’s often still time to finish it later. One bad choice feels no big deal.

But if you keep making small mistakes every day—like bad choices and excuses—those little errors add up and cause big problems. It’s the small 1 percent mistakes repeated over time that lead to trouble.

Changing your habits is like slightly changing an airplane’s direction. Imagine flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If the pilot changes the course just a little, you might end up in Washington, D.C. instead. At first, it’s barely noticeable, but after a long time, it makes a huge difference. Just like that, small changes in your daily habits can lead your life to a very different place. Choosing to be 1 percent better or worse each day seems small, but over your whole life, these choices decide who you become. Success comes from daily habits, not big sudden changes.

It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now.

What matters is if your habits are moving you toward success.

You should care more about the path you’re on than where you are now. If you’re rich but spend more than you earn every month, you’re heading the wrong way. If you don’t change your spending, things won’t end well. But if you’re broke and save a little each month, you’re moving toward financial freedom, even if it feels slow.

Your results show your habits from before. Your money shows your money habits. Your weight shows your eating habits. Your knowledge shows how much you learn.

Your mess shows how you clean. You get what you put into your habits.
