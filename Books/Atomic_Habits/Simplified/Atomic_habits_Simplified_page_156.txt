Everyone slips up sometimes with their habits.

But the important thing is to have a plan for when your habits get off track.

HOW TO BOUNCE BACK FAST WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK No matter how good you are at keeping habits, life will mess things up sometimes. You can’t be perfect. Maybe you get sick, have to travel, or your family needs you more.

When this happens to me, I remember one rule: never miss twice.

If I miss one day, I try to get back on track quickly. Missing one workout is okay, but I won’t miss two in a row. Maybe I eat a whole pizza one day, but then I eat something healthy next. I can’t be perfect, but I can stop myself from slipping again. When one streak ends, I start a new one right away.

The first mistake isn’t what ruins you. It’s the chain of mistakes after that. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice becomes a new habit.

This is what separates winners from losers. Everyone has bad days or bad workouts. But winners bounce back fast. Breaking a habit isn’t a big deal if you get back to it quickly.

I think this idea is so important that I stick to it even if I can’t do the habit perfectly. Too often, people think if they can’t do something perfectly, they shouldn’t do it at all.

You don’t realize how much it helps to just show up on your bad or busy days. Losing days hurt you more than good days help you. For example, if you start with $100, a 50% gain takes you to $150, but a 33% loss brings you back to $100. So avoiding losses is just as important as making gains. Like Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” That’s why bad workouts are often the most important. Slow or bad days keep the good progress you made before. Just doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything—is a big deal. Don’t do nothing. Don’t let losses take over.
