Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his three-day show in New York. He quickly became one of the most famous comedians of his time.

His name is Steve Martin.

Martin’s story shows what it takes to keep habits going for a long time. Comedy is not for the scared. It’s hard to think of anything more scary than being alone on stage and not making anyone laugh. But Steve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen years. He said, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining, and 4 years as a wild success.” Why do some people, like Martin, stick with their habits—whether it’s practicing jokes, drawing cartoons, or playing guitar—while most of us find it hard to stay motivated? How do we make habits that keep us interested instead of losing interest? Scientists have been trying to figure this out for years.

Even though we still have more to learn, one thing is clear: to stay motivated and want to keep going, you should work on tasks that are just a little bit challenging. The brain likes a challenge, but only if it’s not too easy or too hard. If you love tennis and play against a four-year-old, you’ll get bored fast because it’s too easy. You’ll win every point. But if you play against a pro like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you’ll lose interest because it’s way too hard.

Now think about playing tennis against someone who is just as good as you. As you play, you win some points and lose some. You have a real chance to win if you try hard. You focus a lot, ignore distractions, and get really into the game. This is a challenge that is just right, and it’s a perfect example of the Goldilocks Rule.

The Goldilocks Rule says that people feel most motivated when they work on tasks that are just right for their skills—not too hard and not too easy. Just right.
