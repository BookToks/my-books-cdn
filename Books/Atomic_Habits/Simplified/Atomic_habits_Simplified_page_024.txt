The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be silly to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. As three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh said, “The score takes care of itself.” This idea works in other parts of life too. If you want better results, don’t just focus on goals. Focus on your system instead.

What do I mean by this? Are goals useless? Of course not. Goals help you know where to go, but systems help you make progress. Problems happen when you spend too much time thinking about goals and not enough time creating good systems.

Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.

Goal setting has a big mistake called survivorship bias. We look at the winners and think their big goals made them successful, but we forget about all the people who had the same goals and didn’t win.

Every Olympian wants a gold medal. Every job candidate wants the job. Since both winners and losers want the same things, goals can’t be what makes the difference. The British cyclists didn’t win the Tour de France just because they wanted to—they wanted it every year, just like everyone else. They won because they made small improvements all the time with a smart system.

Problem #2: Achieving a goal only changes things for a little while.

Imagine your room is messy and you set a goal to clean it. If you find the energy to clean, your room will be neat—just for a bit. But if you keep being messy, soon the clutter will come back and you’ll hope for another burst of motivation. You keep chasing the same goal because you never fixed the habits that caused the mess. You treated the problem, not the cause.

Changing your goal only changes your life for a moment. This is the surprising thing about getting better. We think we need to change the results, but the real problem is the systems that create those results. When you fix the systems, the results will follow.
