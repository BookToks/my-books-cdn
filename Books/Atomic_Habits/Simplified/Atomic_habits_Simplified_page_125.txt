Here are simple ways to make good habits the easiest choice.

You can also do the opposite and make bad habits harder. For example, if you watch too much TV, unplug it every time after you use it. Only plug it back in if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch. This small step stops you from watching TV without thinking.

If that’s not enough, try taking the batteries out of the remote too, so it takes extra time to turn the TV on. And if you want to be really serious, move the TV to a closet after you use it. You’ll only get it out when you really want to watch something. The harder it is to do, the less you’ll do it.

I like to leave my phone in another room until lunchtime. If it’s next to me, I check it all morning for no reason. But if it’s far away, I hardly think about it. It’s hard enough to go get it without a real reason. This way, I get three to four hours every morning to work without distractions.

If leaving your phone in another room doesn’t work, ask a friend or family member to hide it for a few hours. Or tell a coworker to keep it at their desk in the morning and give it back at lunch.

It’s amazing how little effort it takes to stop bad habits.

When I hide beer at the back of the fridge where I can’t see it, I drink less. When I delete social media apps, it takes weeks before I download them again. These tricks won’t fix serious addictions, but for most of us, a little extra effort can help us stick to good habits instead of bad ones. Imagine how much better life would be if you made lots of these small changes to make good habits easier and bad habits harder.

Whether you’re trying to change yourself, help your family, coach a team, or lead others, ask: “How can I make it easy to do what’s right?” Change your life so the things that matter most are also the easiest to do.
