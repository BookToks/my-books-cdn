Eventually, you’ll start to connect this breathe-and-smile routine with feeling happy. It becomes a sign that means you’re in a good mood. Once you get used to it, you can use it anytime you want to change how you feel. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and smile. Feeling sad? Take three deep breaths and smile. When it becomes a habit, this sign can make you want to do it, even if it doesn’t really match the situation.

The secret to finding and fixing your bad habits is to change how you think about them. It’s not easy, but if you can change what you expect, you can turn a tough habit into a good one.
