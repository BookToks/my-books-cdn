Deliberate practice.

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery. To get really good at something, some skills have to become automatic. Basketball players need to dribble without thinking before they can learn to shoot layups with their weaker hand. Surgeons have to practice the first cut so many times that they can do it with their eyes closed, so they can pay attention to all the other things happening during surgery. But once you master one habit, you have to work hard again to learn the next one.

Mastery means focusing on a small part of success, practicing it until it becomes natural, and then using that new habit to move on to the next level. Old tasks get easier the second time, but overall it doesn’t get easier because now you’re working on the next challenge. Every habit helps you improve and reach higher. It’s a never-ending process.
