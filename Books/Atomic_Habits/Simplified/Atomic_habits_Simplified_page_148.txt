Disease and infection don’t usually show up right away. Sometimes it takes days, weeks, or even years.

Every habit you have causes different results over time. Sadly, these results don’t always match up. Bad habits often feel good right now but cause problems later. Good habits usually don’t feel fun at first, but they help you in the long run. The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained this well when he said, “When the first result feels good, the later results are often bad, and when the first result feels bad, the later results are usually good.” In other words, good habits cost you now, but bad habits cost you later.

Our brain likes to focus on what’s happening right now, so just having good intentions isn’t enough. When you make plans—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a new language—you’re actually making plans for your future self. It’s easy to see why doing things that help you later is worth it because everyone wants a better life in the future.

But when it’s time to actually decide, instant rewards usually win. You stop choosing for Future You, who wants to be healthier or happier. Instead, you choose for Present You, who just wants to feel good right now. The more fun something is right away, the more you should ask yourself if it really helps your long-term goals. The key rule of changing behavior is: things that give you a reward right away get repeated, and things that cause pain right away get avoided.

Because we like quick rewards, most people spend their time chasing easy pleasures. The harder path is waiting for the good stuff later. If you can wait, you’ll face less competition and usually get better results. Like the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.

Research shows that people who can wait for rewards do better in life. They get higher test scores, avoid drugs, stay healthier, handle stress better, and have better social skills. We’ve all seen this in our own lives. If you wait to watch TV and finish your homework first, you usually learn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy junk food at the store, you often eat healthier later. Success in almost everything means ignoring quick rewards for bigger rewards later.
