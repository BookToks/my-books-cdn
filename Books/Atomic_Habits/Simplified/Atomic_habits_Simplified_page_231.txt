Making your environment ready for good habits is important (pages 156–58). Changing your environment can help you a lot (pages 86–87). Sometimes, ads make you want to buy things you don’t need (page 83). During the Vietnam War, many soldiers got addicted to heroin, which is an example of a big problem (pages 91–92).

There was a study about exercise where people planned exactly when to work out, which helped them stick to it (pages 69–70). What you expect can change how you feel and act (pages 262–64). When you have to choose between exploring new things or sticking with what you know, that’s called the explore/exploit trade-off (pages 223–25).

Nir Eyal is someone who talks about habits and behavior (page 170). Failure is just part of learning and changing (page 263). Feedback loops happen in everything we do; they are cycles that keep us going (page 45). Dopamine, a brain chemical, helps drive habits by making us feel good (pages 105–108). All habits come together to shape who you are (page 40).

A habit is something you do regularly without much thinking (pages 49–51). Your feelings also play a big role in habits (pages 129–30, 261–64). The first rule to changing behavior is to make the habit obvious (pages 64–66). One way is to keep track of your habits (page 197). Another way is called habit stacking, where you add a new habit right after an old one (pages 74–79, 110–11).

Planning exactly when and where you’ll do a habit is called implementation intention, and it really helps (pages 69–72). To stop bad habits, it helps to hide the things that trigger them (pages 94–95). Roger Fisher has ideas about resolving conflicts (pages 205–206). Getting into a flow state means being super focused and enjoying what you do (pages 224, 232–33).

Food scientists know how to make junk food taste really good by hitting the “bliss point,” which makes you crave more (pages 102–103). Processed foods use a mix of tastes and textures to keep you hooked (page 103). Orosensation means the way food feels in your mouth (page 103).

There are four main rules for changing behavior (pages 53–55, 186, 252–53). The process of building a habit has four steps: cue (what starts it), craving (the want), response (the action), and reward (the good feeling) (pages 47–49). This is called the habit loop (pages 49–51). Understanding this helps solve problems with habits (pages 51–53).

The fourth rule is to make habits satisfying so you want to keep doing them (pages 207–10). Keeping a habit contract, where you promise yourself or someone else to stick to a habit, works well (pages 207–10). Instant rewards make new habits easier to keep (pages 188–93). Making bad habit cues feel unpleasant helps stop them (pages 205–206).

For example, in Pakistan, putting soap in schools helped kids wash their hands better (pages 184–85). Victor Frankl wrote about finding meaning in life (page 260). Benjamin Franklin used to track his habits carefully (page 196).

How often you do a habit affects how strong it gets (pages 145–47). Making a behavior easier by reducing friction helps; like fixing a garden hose to stop leaks saves effort (pages 152–58). In a Japanese factory, they cut out wasted time to work better (pages 154–55). Removing friction can prevent bad habits (pages 157–58).

Some habits are “gateway habits” that lead to other good habits (page 163). Genes can influence behavior but don’t control everything (pages 218–21, 226–27).

Goals can affect happiness but they don’t last long (pages 24–27). Winners and losers often have the same goals (pages 24–25). Systems, or focusing on the process, work better than just setting goals (pages 23–24).

The Goldilocks Rule says you do your best when challenges are just right — not too hard or too easy (pages 224, 232–33). For example, tennis players perform best when the game is challenging but not impossible (page 231).

There’s a table showing how to create good habits (pages 96, 136, 178, 212). The Two-Minute Rule says you should start new habits by doing them for just two minutes to make it easier (pages 162–67).

Goodhart’s Law is about how measuring something can change it (page 203). Paul Graham is an author who talks about habits and success (pages 247–48).

Greylag geese get tricked by fake signals, which is like how junk food tricks our brains (page 102). Hicham El Guerrouj is a famous athlete studied for habits and performance (pages 217–18, 225).

The book Guns, Germs, and Steel talks about why some societies became powerful (pages 149–51).

A habit contract is when you make a deal with yourself or others to keep a habit. For example, Bryan Harris used this to lose weight (pages 208–209). Seat belt laws are another example of using contracts to build good habits (pages 207–208).
