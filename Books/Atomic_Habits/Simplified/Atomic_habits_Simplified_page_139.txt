Technology can sometimes work against us. Binge-watching becomes a habit because it takes more effort to stop watching than to keep going. Instead of pressing a button for the next episode, Netflix or YouTube will play it automatically. All you have to do is keep watching.

Technology makes things super easy. If you’re hungry, you can get food delivered fast. If you’re bored, you can scroll through tons of social media. When doing what you want takes almost no effort, you might just follow every impulse you have. The problem is that automation can make you jump from one easy thing to another, skipping harder but more rewarding tasks.

I often find myself going to social media whenever I have free time. If I get bored for even a second, I grab my phone. It’s easy to think of these little breaks as harmless, but they can add up to a big problem. The “just one more minute” feeling can stop me from doing anything important. I’m not alone—people spend over two hours a day on social media. Imagine what you could do with an extra 600 hours a year!

While writing this book, I tried a new way to manage my time. Every Monday, my assistant changed my social media passwords and logged me out everywhere. I worked all week without distractions. On Friday, she sent me the new passwords so I could use social media on the weekend. Then on Monday, she changed them again. (If you don’t have an assistant, you could ask a friend or family member to do this for you.) The biggest surprise was how fast I got used to it. After the first week without social media, I saw I didn’t need to check it as much as I thought, and I definitely didn’t need it every day. It was just so easy before that it became my habit. When I couldn’t use it, I found I actually wanted to work on more meaningful things. Once I removed the easy distractions, it was easier to focus on what really matters.

When used right, automation can make good habits happen automatically and bad habits impossible. It’s the best way to make sure you stick to good behavior instead of just relying on willpower. By using commitment strategies, smart decisions, and technology, you can create a life where good habits just happen naturally.
