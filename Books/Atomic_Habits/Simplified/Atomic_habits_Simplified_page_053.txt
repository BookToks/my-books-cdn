Museum experts can tell the difference between a real piece of art and a fake one, even if they can’t explain exactly how. Experienced doctors can look at a brain scan and guess where a stroke might happen before anyone else can see it. I’ve even heard of hairdressers knowing if a client is pregnant just by how her hair feels.

The human brain is like a prediction machine. It’s always paying attention to what’s around you and figuring things out. When you see or do something a lot—like a paramedic who recognizes a heart attack patient or a military person spotting a missile on a radar—your brain starts to notice what’s important. It sorts through all the details, picks out the clues, and remembers them for later.

With enough practice, you can spot signs that show what might happen next without even thinking about it. Your brain learns from experience automatically. Sometimes you don’t know exactly what you’ve learned, but it’s happening, and being able to notice these signs helps build all your habits.

We don’t realize how much our brain and body do without us thinking.

You don’t have to tell your hair to grow, your heart to beat, your lungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest food. Your body does all that on its own. You are way more than just your conscious mind.

Think about hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t have to see a cookie to know it’s time to eat.

Hunger and appetite happen without you thinking about it. Your body has systems that slowly tell you when you need to eat again and that watch what’s going on inside and outside you. Sometimes cravings happen because of hormones and chemicals in your body. Suddenly, you feel hungry, even if you don’t know why.

This is one of the coolest things about habits: you don’t have to be aware of the trigger for a habit to start. You can notice a chance to do something and act on it without really thinking. That’s what makes habits helpful.

But it’s also what makes them risky. When habits form, your actions are controlled by your automatic, unconscious mind. You slip into old habits before you even realize it. Unless someone points it out, you might not notice little habits like covering your mouth when you laugh, apologizing before asking a question, or finishing...
