Thirty.

Thirty-one.

Still, nothing has happened.

Then, at thirty-two degrees, the ice starts to melt. Just a one-degree change, which seems like no big deal, causes a huge difference.

Big breakthroughs usually come from many small steps that build up over time. This happens all the time. Cancer can grow quietly for most of its time, then suddenly spread fast. Bamboo looks like it’s barely growing for five years, but it’s actually building roots underground before shooting up really tall in just six weeks.

In the same way, habits might seem useless at first until you hit a certain point and suddenly improve a lot. When you start something new, there’s often a rough patch called the Valley of Disappointment. You expect steady progress but feel stuck for days, weeks, or even months. It feels like you’re not moving forward. This delay is normal for anything that grows slowly but becomes powerful.

This is why making habits that stick is so hard.

People try a little, don’t see results, and give up.

You might think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why don’t I see any changes?” When you think like this, it’s easy to quit. But to really improve, habits need time to get past this stuck phase—which I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.

If you’re having trouble building good habits or stopping bad ones, it’s not because you can’t get better. It’s because you haven’t reached the Plateau of Latent Potential yet. Complaining about no results after trying is like being upset that ice didn’t melt when you warmed it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your effort isn’t wasted; it’s just building up. The real change happens at thirty-two degrees.

When you finally get past this plateau, people will say you succeeded “overnight.” They only see the big moment, not all the work before it. But you know it’s the effort from when it felt like nothing was happening that made this jump possible.

It’s like the Earth's plates pushing against each other for millions of years, slowly building up pressure until something big happens.
