Habits are like the interest you earn on money over time. Getting just 1 percent better every day really adds up in the long run.

Habits can be good or bad. They can help you or hold you back, so it’s important to understand how they work.

Small changes might not seem to matter at first, but once you reach a certain point, they make a big difference. The best results take time, so you have to be patient.

An atomic habit is a tiny habit that is part of a bigger system. Just like atoms build molecules, atomic habits build amazing results.

If you want to get better, don’t just focus on setting goals. Work on your system instead.

You don’t get better just by having goals. You get better by having good systems in place.
