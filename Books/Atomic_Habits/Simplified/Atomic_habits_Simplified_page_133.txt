Starting to Exercise

Phase 1: Change into your workout clothes.

Phase 2: Step outside the door and try taking a walk.

Phase 3: Drive to the gym, exercise for five minutes, then leave.

Phase 4: Exercise for at least fifteen minutes once a week.

Phase 5: Exercise three times a week.

Almost any big goal can be broken down into a two-minute action. For example: I want to live a healthy, long life > I need to stay in shape > I need to exercise > I need to put on my workout clothes. Or: I want a happy marriage > I need to be a good partner > I should do something every day to help my partner > I should plan meals for next week.

When you find it hard to keep a habit, you can use the Two-Minute Rule. Itâ€™s an easy way to make habits simple to start.
