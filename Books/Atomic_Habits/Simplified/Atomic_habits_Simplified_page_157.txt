Also, it’s not just about what you do during your workout. It’s about being the kind of person who doesn’t skip workouts. It’s easy to exercise when you feel good, but it’s really important to show up even when you don’t feel like it— even if you do less than you want. Going to the gym for just five minutes might not boost your performance, but it reminds you who you are.

One problem with trying to change habits is the all-or-nothing attitude. Another problem—especially if you use a habit tracker—is tracking the wrong thing.

Knowing when (and when not) to track a habit is key. Imagine you run a restaurant and want to see if your chef is doing well. One way is to count how many customers pay for a meal each day. If more people come, the food must be good. If fewer come, something might be wrong.

But just looking at daily money doesn’t tell the whole story. Just because someone pays doesn’t mean they liked the food. Even unhappy customers usually don’t leave without paying.

Actually, if you only watch the money, the food might be getting worse, but you might be using ads or discounts to keep customers coming.

It might be better to track how many customers finish their meal or how many leave a big tip.

The problem with tracking just one thing is that we start caring about the number more than the real goal. If success means quarterly earnings, you’ll focus on sales and money for that quarter. If success means a lower number on the scale, you might try crash diets or pills to drop weight fast. Our brain wants to “win” whatever game we’re playing.

This happens in many parts of life. We work long hours instead of doing important work. We care more about hitting 10,000 steps than being healthy. We teach to pass tests instead of helping students love learning and think deeply. Basically, we do well at what we measure. If we pick the wrong thing to measure, we get the wrong results.

This idea is called Goodhart’s Law. It’s named after economist Charles Goodhart, and it means, “When a measure becomes a target, it...”
