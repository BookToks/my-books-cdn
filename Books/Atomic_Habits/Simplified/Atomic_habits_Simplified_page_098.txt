2. Copying What Others Do

In the 1950s, a psychologist named Solomon Asch did some experiments that many college students learn about even today. At the start of each test, a person came into a room with a group of strangers. What they didn’t know was that the other people were actors hired by the researcher and told to give certain answers.

The group was shown one card with a line on it and then another card with several lines. Everyone had to pick which line on the second card was about the same length as the first line. It was a really easy task.

Here’s an example of the two cards used: The line on the first card (on the left) clearly matches line C on the second card. But when the actors said it was a different line, the person being tested often changed their answer to match the group instead of trusting what they saw.

The experiment always started the same way. First, there were some easy questions.
