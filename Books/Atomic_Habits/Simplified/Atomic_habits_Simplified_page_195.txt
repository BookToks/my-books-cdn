Success isn’t something you just reach or finish. It’s a way to keep getting better and better. In Chapter 1, I said, “If you find it hard to change your habits, it’s not your fault. The problem is your system.

Bad habits keep happening not because you don’t want to change, but because your system for change is wrong.” Now that we’re at the end of the book, I hope you have the opposite. Using the Four Laws of Behavior Change, you have tools to build better systems and create better habits.

Sometimes a habit is hard to remember, so you need to make it obvious. Other times, you don’t feel like starting, so you need to make it attractive. Sometimes a habit feels too hard, so you make it easy. And sometimes you don’t want to keep going, so you make it satisfying.

Behaviors that are easy happen here. Behaviors that are hard happen here.

Obvious — Invisible  
Attractive — Unattractive  
Easy — Hard  
Satisfying — Unsatisfying  

You want to push your good habits to the left side by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. You want to push your bad habits to the right side by making them invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.

This never ends. There is no finish line or perfect fix. When you want to get better, you go through the Four Laws of Behavior Change again and again, finding the next problem. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. Keep doing this over and over, always trying to get just 1% better.

The secret to lasting results is to never stop improving.

It’s amazing what you can build if you don’t stop. It’s amazing the business you can grow if you keep working. It’s amazing the body you can get if you keep training. It’s amazing the knowledge you can gain if you keep learning. It’s amazing the money you can save if you keep saving. It’s amazing the friendships you can make if you keep caring. Small habits don’t just add up. They multiply.

That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Amazing results.
