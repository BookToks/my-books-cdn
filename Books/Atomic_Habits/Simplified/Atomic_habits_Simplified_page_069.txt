Dr. Thorndike, a doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, had a wild idea. She thought she could help thousands of hospital workers and visitors eat better without asking them to be more motivated or strong-willed. She didnâ€™t even plan to talk to them.

Thorndike and her team did a six-month study where they changed how drinks were arranged in the hospital cafeteria. At first, the fridges near the cash registers only had soda. The researchers added water to those fridges. They also put baskets of bottled water next to the food stations around the room. Soda was still in the main fridges, but now water was easy to find everywhere.

In the next three months, soda sales dropped by 11.4 percent. At the same time, sales of bottled water went up by 25.8 percent.

They made similar changes with the food options and saw similar results. No one was told to change what they ate or drank.
