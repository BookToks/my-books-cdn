How motivated you are to keep up certain habits depends on how proud you feel about them. For example, if you like how your hair looks, you’ll start doing things to take care of it. If you’re proud of your big muscles, you’ll make sure not to skip workouts. If you love the scarves you knit, you’ll spend a lot of time knitting each week. When you feel proud, you’ll work really hard to keep your habits going.

Real change happens when you change how you see yourself. You might start a habit because you’re motivated, but you only keep it if it becomes part of who you are. Anyone can go to the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t believe it’s part of you, it’s hard to keep doing it for a long time. Changes only last if they become part of your identity.

The goal isn’t just to read a book, it’s to become a reader.

The goal isn’t just to run a marathon, it’s to become a runner.

The goal isn’t just to learn an instrument, it’s to become a musician.

What you do usually shows who you think you are. Your actions reflect your identity, whether you realize it or not. Studies show that when people truly believe something about themselves, they act that way more often.

For example, people who think of themselves as “voters” are more likely to actually vote than people who just say they want to vote.

Similarly, someone who sees exercise as part of who they are doesn’t have to force themselves to train. It feels natural. When your actions and your identity match up, you’re not trying to change your behavior—you’re just being who you already think you are.

But like everything, this can be both good and bad. When it works for you, changing your identity can help you improve a lot.

But when it works against you, it can be a problem. Once you pick an identity, it can be hard to change because you stick to what fits that identity. Many people go through life without thinking, just following the habits that match their identity.
