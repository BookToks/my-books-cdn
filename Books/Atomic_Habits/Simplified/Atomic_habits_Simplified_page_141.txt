Chapter Summary: The opposite of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is to make things hard.

A commitment device is a choice you make now that helps you stick to better habits later.

The best way to lock in future habits is to make them automatic.

One-time choices—like buying a better mattress or signing up for automatic savings—are actions that make your future habits automatic and give you more benefits over time.

Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to make sure you do the right things.
