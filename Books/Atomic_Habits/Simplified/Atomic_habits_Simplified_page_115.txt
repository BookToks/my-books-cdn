This idea is called Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.” When you do something over and over, your brain actually changes physically. For example, musicians have a bigger cerebellum, which helps with moving their hands to play instruments like guitar or violin. Mathematicians have more gray matter in a part of the brain that helps with math. The more time they spend doing math, the bigger that part gets.

Scientists studied London taxi drivers and found that their hippocampus, the part of the brain that helps with memory and navigation, was bigger than in people who don’t drive taxis. Even more interesting, this part got smaller when the drivers stopped working. Just like muscles get stronger with exercise and weaker without it, parts of your brain get stronger when you use them and shrink when you don’t.

People knew repetition was important for habits even before science explained it. In 1860, a thinker named George H. Lewes said that learning new things like a language or an instrument is hard at first because your brain hasn’t made the right connections yet. But when you repeat something enough, it becomes easier and automatic, so you can do it without thinking much.

Every time you repeat something, you activate the same brain pathway that helps make that action a habit. So, practicing a lot is super important to build new habits. That’s why students who took lots of photos got better at photography, while those who only thought about perfect photos didn’t improve as much. One group was doing the work; the other was just thinking about it.

All habits start with hard practice but become automatic over time. This is called automaticity, which means you can do something without thinking about every step because your brain has learned it so well.

It looks something like this: THE HABIT LINE
