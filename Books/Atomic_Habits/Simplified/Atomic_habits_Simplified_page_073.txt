Here are some easy ways to change your surroundings to remind you to do good habits. If you want to remember to take your medicine every night, put the pill bottle right next to the bathroom sink.

If you want to practice guitar more often, put your guitar stand in the middle of the living room.

If you want to send more thank-you notes, keep some stationery on your desk.

If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and put them in places you see a lot around the house.

If you want a habit to be a big part of your life, make the reminders a big part of your space. Usually, habits stick better when there are many reminders.

Think about a smoker. They might want to smoke when they drive, see a friend smoking, or feel stressed at work. These are lots of different reminders.

You can do the same for good habits. By putting little reminders all around you, you’ll think about your habit more during the day. Make sure the best choice is the easiest to see.

It’s simple to make better choices when the reminders for good habits are right in front of you.

Changing your environment is powerful because it shapes how you act, but most people don’t do it. Most live in places others set up for them. But you can change your home and work spaces to see more good reminders and fewer bad ones. Designing your environment lets you take control and build your life the way you want. Be the boss of your world, not just someone who uses it.

THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE  
The things that start a habit might begin with one small reminder, but over time, your habits get linked to the whole situation around you.

For example, many people drink more when they’re with friends than when they’re alone. It’s not just one thing that makes them drink—it’s the whole situation.
