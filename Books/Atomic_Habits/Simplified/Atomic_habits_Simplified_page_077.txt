Chapter Summary

Small changes in your surroundings can cause big changes in how you act over time.

Every habit starts because of a signal or cue. We tend to notice cues that are easy to see.

Make the signs of good habits clear and easy to spot where you live or hang out.

Over time, your habits don’t just happen because of one cue but because of everything around you. The whole place becomes the cue.

It’s easier to create new habits in a new place because you aren’t dealing with old signals that remind you of old habits.
