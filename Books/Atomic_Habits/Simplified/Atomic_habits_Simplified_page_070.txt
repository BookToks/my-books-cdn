FIGURE 8 shows what the cafeteria looked like before the design changes (left) and after (right). The shaded boxes show where bottled water was available. Because more water was placed around, people naturally started drinking more without needing extra motivation.

People often pick things not because of what they are, but because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I might grab a bunch and start eating, even if I wasn’t thinking about cookies or hungry. If the office table always has doughnuts and bagels, it’s hard not to take one sometimes. Your habits change depending on the room you’re in and what you see around you.

The environment is like an invisible force that shapes how people act. Even though we all have different personalities, certain behaviors happen again and again in certain places. In church, people usually whisper. On a dark street, people act careful and watchful. This shows that the biggest kind of change usually comes from outside, not inside: we are shaped by the world around us.

Every habit depends on the situation.

In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple formula: Behavior equals a function of the Person and their Environment, or B = f (P,E).

This idea was soon tested in business. In 1952, economist Hawkins Stern talked about Suggestion Impulse Buying, which means people sometimes buy things just because they see them in a certain way for the first time and imagine needing them. In other words, customers don’t always buy things because they want them, but because of how the products are shown to them.
