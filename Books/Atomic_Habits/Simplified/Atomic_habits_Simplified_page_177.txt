The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work

In 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California. A ten-year-old boy walked in and asked for a job. Back then, labor laws were not strict, so the boy got a job selling guidebooks for 50 cents each.

Within a year, he moved to Disney’s magic shop, where he learned tricks from older workers. He tried out jokes and simple magic shows on visitors. Soon, he realized he didn’t love magic itself, but loved performing in general. He decided he wanted to be a comedian.

When he became a teenager, he started performing in small clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds were small, and his acts were short. He was rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most people in the audience were busy drinking or talking and didn’t pay much attention. One night, he even performed to an empty club.

It wasn’t a fancy job, but he was definitely getting better. At first, his routines lasted only one or two minutes. By high school, he could do a five-minute show, and a few years later, a ten-minute one. At nineteen, he did twenty-minute performances every week. Sometimes he had to read poems during the show just to make it long enough, but he kept improving.

He spent another ten years trying new things, making changes, and practicing. He got a job as a TV writer and slowly started appearing on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he was a regular guest on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live.

After nearly fifteen years of hard work, the young man finally became famous. He went on tour, visiting sixty cities in sixty-three days.

Then he visited seventy-two cities in eighty days.

Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. One of his shows had 18,695 people attend.
