Chapter Summary

The culture we live in decides which behaviors we find attractive.

We usually pick up habits that our culture likes because we really want to fit in and be part of the group.

We copy the habits of three groups: people close to us (family and friends), the larger group (our tribe), and powerful people (those with status and respect).

One of the best ways to build good habits is to join a group where (1) the behavior you want is normal and (2) you already share something with the group.

The group's normal behavior often beats what we want to do alone. Most of the time, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than right by ourselves.

If a behavior helps us get approval, respect, and praise, we think it’s attractive.
