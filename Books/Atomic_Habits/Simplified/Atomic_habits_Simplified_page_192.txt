Habits have a lot of good points. But the problem is they can trap us in old ways of thinking and doing things, even when everything around us is changing.  

Nothing stays the same. Life is always changing, so you should regularly check if your old habits and beliefs still help you.  

Not knowing yourself well is harmful. Thinking about yourself and your actions is the way to fix that.
