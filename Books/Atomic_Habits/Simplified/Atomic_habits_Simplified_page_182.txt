If you start a habit and keep doing it, there will be days when you just want to give up. When you start a business, some days you won’t want to work. At the gym, there will be exercises you don’t want to finish. When it’s time to write, some days you won’t feel like typing. But pushing through when it’s annoying, painful, or tiring is what makes the difference between a pro and a beginner.

Pros stick to their schedule; beginners let life get in the way.

Pros know what’s important and work toward it with focus; beginners get distracted by urgent stuff.

David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, tells his students not to be “fair-weather meditators.” In the same way, you don’t want to be someone who only works out, writes, or does anything when it’s easy or fun. When a habit really matters, you have to stick with it no matter how you feel.

Pros take action even when they don’t feel like it. They might not enjoy it, but they still do the work.

Many times I didn’t want to finish my workout, but I never regretted it. Sometimes I didn’t want to write articles, but I never regretted publishing on time. There were days I wanted to relax, but I never regretted showing up and working on things that mattered to me.

The only way to get really good is to love doing the same thing over and over. You have to learn to enjoy being bored.
