FIGURE 9: Before you get used to a habit (A), your brain releases dopamine when you get a reward for the first time. The next time (B), dopamine goes up before you even do the action, right after you see a sign or cue. This makes you want to do the action whenever you notice the cue.

After the habit is learned, dopamine doesn’t rise when you get the reward because you already expect it. But if you see a cue and expect a reward but don’t get it, dopamine drops and you feel disappointed (C).

You can see how dopamine reacts when the reward comes late (D). First, you spot the cue and dopamine rises, making you want the reward. Then you do the action, but the reward is slower than you thought, so dopamine drops. When the reward finally comes, dopamine spikes again. It’s like your brain is saying, “I was right! Remember to do this again next time.”

Your brain has way more parts for wanting rewards than for just liking them. The wanting parts are big and include areas like the brain stem, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, and dorsal striatum.
