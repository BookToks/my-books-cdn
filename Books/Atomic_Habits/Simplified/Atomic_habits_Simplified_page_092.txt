After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m thankful for that happened yesterday (need).

After I say one thing I’m thankful for, I will read the news (want).

If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls:  
1. After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential clients (need).  
2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).

If you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more:  
1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).  
2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).

The idea is that over time, you’ll start to look forward to calling three clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest sports news or check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do lets you do the thing you want to do.

We started this chapter by talking about supernormal stimuli, which are stronger versions of reality that make us want to take action more. Temptation bundling is one way to make any habit stronger by linking it to something you already want. Creating a habit you can’t resist is hard, but this simple trick can make almost any habit more fun and easier to stick to.
