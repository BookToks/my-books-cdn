People see the same facts but react differently because they view those facts through their own feelings. That’s why feelings usually have a stronger effect than logic. When something makes someone emotional, they often don’t care much about the facts.

This is why emotions can make it hard to make smart decisions.

In other words, most people think the smart choice is the one that benefits them or makes them happy. But if you can stay calm and not let your emotions take over, you can make decisions based on facts instead of feelings.

Suffering pushes us to improve. All suffering comes from wanting things to be different. But this wanting is also what causes progress. Wanting something better makes us take action. It’s this desire that helps people invent new things and reach higher goals.

When we want something, we feel unhappy but motivated. Without wanting, we feel okay but don’t try hard.

What you do shows how much you want something. If you say something is important but never do anything about it, then you probably don’t really want it. You need to be honest with yourself because your actions show what you really care about.

You have to work hard before you get a reward. You first spend energy (sacrifice), then you get something good (reward). Like when a runner feels great after finishing a tough run. The good feeling comes only after the hard work.

Self-control is hard because it doesn’t feel good. A reward satisfies your wanting. Self-control doesn’t satisfy your desire; it just ignores it for a while. It gives the craving time to go away. To have self-control, you have to let go of a desire, not fulfill it.

What we expect affects how happy we feel. The difference between what we want and what we get decides if we feel satisfied. If you get more than you expected, you feel happy and want to do it again. If you get less, you feel disappointed and don’t want to repeat it.

For example, if you expect $10 but get $100, you feel awesome. But if you expect $100 and get only $10, you feel let down. High expectations with an average result feel bad. Low expectations with the same result feel great. When how much you like something and how much you want it are about the same, you feel satisfied.

Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting
