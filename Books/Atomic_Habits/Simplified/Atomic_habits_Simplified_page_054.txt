Sometimes, we copy what other people say and do without thinking about it. The more we do this, the less we question why we’re doing it.

I once heard about a store worker who was told to cut up empty gift cards after customers used all the money on them. One day, after helping a few customers with gift cards, the worker accidentally cut a customer’s real credit card in half without thinking. The worker only realized what happened when the customer looked shocked.

Another woman I read about used to be a preschool teacher but then got a corporate job. Even though she worked with adults now, she still asked her coworkers if they washed their hands after going to the bathroom. I also learned about a man who worked as a lifeguard for years and would sometimes shout “Walk!” when he saw a kid running.

Over time, the things that remind us to do habits become so normal that we don’t even notice them anymore. It could be snacks on the kitchen counter, the TV remote by the couch, or your phone in your pocket. Our reactions to these reminders are so automatic that it might feel like the urge to act comes out of nowhere. That’s why the first step to changing habits is to pay attention to them.

Before we can make new habits, we need to understand the ones we already have. This is hard because habits happen without us thinking. If we stay unaware of our habits, we can’t change them. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”

The Japanese train system is one of the best in the world. If you ever ride a train in Tokyo, you’ll see the train operators have a strange habit.

While driving the train, they point at different things and say out loud what they see. When the train gets close to a signal, the operator points and says, “Signal is green.” When the train stops or leaves a station, they point at the speedometer and say the speed. Before leaving, they point at the timetable and say the time. On the platform, other workers do similar actions. Before a train leaves, they point along the edge of the platform to check safety.
