The song you are listening to ends.

The sun sets.

With these two lists, you can start looking for the best time and place to add your new habit into your daily life.

Habit stacking works best when the reminder is very clear and easy to follow right away. Many people pick reminders that are too vague. I made this mistake too. When I wanted to start doing push-ups, my habit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” At first, this seemed okay. But soon, I saw the reminder was confusing. Should I do push-ups before or after lunch? Where should I do them? After a few days of being unsure, I changed it to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.” No more confusion.

Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are good goals, but they don’t say how or when to do them. Be clear and specific: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. Being specific is important. The more connected your new habit is to a clear reminder, the more likely you are to notice it and do the habit.

The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Ideas like planning exactly when to act and habit stacking help create clear reminders for your habits and make a simple plan for when and where to do them.
