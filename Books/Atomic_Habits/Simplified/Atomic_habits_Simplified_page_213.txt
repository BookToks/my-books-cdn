In Great Britain, some researchers named Sarah Milne, Sheina Orbell, and Paschal Sheeran started studying how to help people exercise more. They looked at ways to motivate people and help them make plans to stick to their goals.

Peter Gollwitzer and Paschal Sheeran found that making clear plans, called implementation intentions, really works to reach goals.

For example, writing down the exact time and date when you will get a flu shot helps you actually go get it. Katherine Milkman and her team showed this in their research.

They also found that noting down your colonoscopy appointment time makes it more likely you’ll go to it.

Making specific plans can even increase how many people vote. David Nickerson and Todd Rogers studied this and saw that having a voting plan helps more people show up.

Governments are using behavioral science to create programs that work better. The Economist wrote about this in 2017.

When people make a clear plan about when and where they will do something, they are more likely to follow through. Edwin Locke and Gary Latham have studied how goal-setting helps keep people motivated.

Hope is usually higher when people see a fresh start, like a new week or month. Hengchen Dai, Katherine Milkman, and Jason Riis call this the Fresh Start Effect.

Writer Jason Zweig talked about how understanding these ideas can help improve your money habits.

There are many ways to use implementation intentions. The idea of “habit stacking” means linking a new habit to one you already have. This term was popularized by S. J. Scott, though others like Courtney Carver and Julien Smith have used it too.

The French philosopher Denis Diderot once got a scarlet robe. People say it was a gift from a friend, but no one really knows for sure. If you know any historians who study robes, let me know!

Diderot wrote about how losing his old dressing gown made him feel like he lost “coordination, unity, and beauty.”

The Diderot Effect explains how getting something new can lead to wanting more new things. Juliet Schor talks about this in her book The Overspent American.

BJ Fogg created the idea behind habit stacking. He calls it “anchoring” because your old habit acts like an anchor that holds the new habit in place. You can learn more about his Tiny Habits Method at tinyhabits.com.

A simple rule to manage stuff is “one in, one out.” Dev Basu suggested this on Twitter to help people avoid buying too much.
