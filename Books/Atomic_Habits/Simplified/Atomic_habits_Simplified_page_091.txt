Besides promoting their shows, ABC told viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and enjoy their evening.

Andrew Kubitz, who is in charge of ABC’s schedule, explained the idea behind the campaign: “We see Thursday night as a chance for people—either couples or women alone—to sit down, relax, have fun, drink their red wine, and eat popcorn.” The smart part of this plan was that ABC connected watching their shows with things people already liked to do, like relaxing, drinking wine, and eating popcorn.

After a while, people started to link watching ABC with feeling calm and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday, then “8 p.m. on Thursday” starts to mean chill time and fun. The good feeling becomes connected with the time, so turning on the TV becomes something you look forward to.

You’re more likely to enjoy doing something if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time. For example, maybe you want to know the latest celebrity gossip but also need to get fit. Using temptation bundling, you could only read gossip and watch reality shows while working out. Or maybe you want a pedicure but need to clean your email inbox. You could only get a pedicure while answering old emails.

Temptation bundling comes from a psychology idea called Premack’s Principle. It’s named after professor David Premack, who said that “more likely behaviors will encourage less likely behaviors.” Basically, even if you don’t want to do the boring stuff, you’ll start doing it if it means you get to do something you really like at the same time.

You can also mix temptation bundling with habit stacking (which we talked about in Chapter 5) to make rules that help you behave better.

The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: 1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].  
2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

For example, if you want to read the news but need to be more thankful:
