Put on deodorant. Hang up towel to dry. Get dressed. Make a cup of tea. . . and so on.

Once you have a full list, look at each habit and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it’s good, write “+” next to it. If it’s bad, write “–”. If it’s neutral, write “=”.

For example, the list above might look like this: Wake up = Turn off alarm = Check my phone – Go to the bathroom = Weigh myself + Take a shower + Brush my teeth + Floss my teeth + Put on deodorant + Hang up towel to dry = Get dressed = Make a cup of tea +

The marks you give to a habit depend on your situation and goals. For someone trying to lose weight, eating a bagel with peanut butter every morning might be a bad habit. But for someone trying to gain muscle, it might be a good habit. It all depends on what you want to achieve.

Scoring your habits can be tricky for another reason too. The words “good habit” and “bad habit” aren’t totally right. There aren’t really good or bad habits, only habits that work well. Every habit helps you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you keep doing them.

For this exercise, sort your habits by how they will help you in the long run. Usually, good habits bring more good results. Bad habits bring more bad results. Smoking a cigarette
