Some habits might make you feel less stressed right now (that’s why you do them), but they aren’t good for you in the long run.

If you’re not sure how to judge a habit, try asking yourself: “Does this habit help me become the person I want to be? Does it support or go against who I want to become?” Habits that match your goals are usually good. Habits that don’t match are usually bad.

When you make your Habits Scorecard, don’t try to change anything at first. Just notice what you’re actually doing. Watch your thoughts and actions without judging yourself. Don’t blame yourself for mistakes. Don’t praise yourself for wins either.

If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, just notice it like you’re watching someone else. That’s interesting that they do that. If you eat too much food at once, just notice you’re eating more than you should. If you waste time online, notice that you’re spending your time in a way you don’t want.

The first step to changing bad habits is to watch out for them. If you want extra help, try Pointing-and-Calling. Say out loud what you’re about to do and what will happen. If you want to eat less junk food but reach for a cookie, say, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it. Eating it will make me gain weight and hurt my health.” Saying it out loud makes the consequences feel real. It helps stop you from doing something without thinking. This trick also works if you want to remember something. Saying, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,” makes it more likely you’ll do it. You’re telling yourself what needs to happen—and that can really help.

Changing how you behave always starts with paying attention. Tricks like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard help you notice your habits and what makes you do them. That way, you can choose to do what’s best for you.
