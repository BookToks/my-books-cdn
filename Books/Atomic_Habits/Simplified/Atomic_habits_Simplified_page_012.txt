Looking back on those years, I think I did something pretty rare: I reached my full potential. And I believe the ideas in this book can help you reach yours too.

We all face problems in life. This injury was one of mine, and it taught me an important lesson: small changes that seem unimportant at first can add up to amazing results if you keep doing them for a long time.

Everyone has setbacks, but in the end, how good our lives are often depends on our habits. If you keep the same habits, you get the same results. But if you build better habits, anything is possible.

Maybe some people get super successful really fast. I don’t know any of them, and I’m definitely not one. There wasn’t just one big moment that changed my life from being in a coma to becoming an Academic All-American. It was lots of small wins and tiny improvements over time. The only way I moved forward was by starting small. I used this same idea years later when I started my own business and wrote this book.

HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK  
In November 2012, I started sharing articles on jamesclear.com. For years, I had been writing notes about my habit experiments and was finally ready to share them with others. I posted new articles every Monday and Thursday. After a few months, this simple habit helped me get my first 1,000 email subscribers, and by the end of 2013, I had over 30,000.

In 2014, my email list grew to more than 100,000 subscribers, making it one of the fastest-growing newsletters online. When I started writing, I felt like a fraud, but now people saw me as an expert on habits. That felt exciting but also a little weird. I never thought of myself as a master, just someone learning with my readers.

In 2015, I reached 200,000 email subscribers and signed a book deal with Penguin Random House to write this book. As more people followed me, I got more chances to work with big companies, teaching them about habits, behavior change, and how to keep improving. I even gave important speeches at conferences in the US and Europe.

In 2016, my articles started showing up regularly in big magazines like Time.
