Habits are just the starting point, not the final goal. They are like a taxi ride to the gym, not the workout itself.

THE TWO-MINUTE RULE  
Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to try to do too much right away. When you want to change, you get excited and often try to do too much too fast. The best way to avoid this is the Two-Minute Rule, which says, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes.”  

Almost any habit can be made super simple. For example, “Read before bed” can be just “Read one page.” “Do thirty minutes of yoga” can be “Take out my yoga mat.” “Study for class” can be “Open my notes.” “Fold the laundry” can be “Fold one pair of socks.” “Run three miles” can be “Tie my running shoes.”  

The goal is to make your habits really easy to start. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put away one piece of clothing. This works well because once you start doing the right thing, it’s easier to keep going. A new habit shouldn’t feel hard at first. The later parts can be tough, but the first two minutes should be easy. You want a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you to do more.

You can find these gateway habits by thinking about your goals from “very easy” to “very hard.” For example, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is medium. Walking ten minutes is easy. Putting on your running shoes is very easy.  

Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is just putting on your running shoes. That’s how the Two-Minute Rule works.

Very easy | Easy | Medium | Hard | Very hard  
Put on your running shoes | Walk ten minutes | Walk ten thousand steps | Run a 5K | Run a marathon  
Write one sentence | Write one paragraph | Write one thousand words | Write a five-thousand-word article | Write a book  
Open your notes | Study for ten minutes | Study for three hours | Get straight A’s | Earn a PhD
