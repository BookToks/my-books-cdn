People think about what they want to happen. At the end of each month or year, they check their choices to see what worked and what didn’t. Getting better isn’t just about learning habits—it’s also about improving them.

Looking back helps you spend time on the right things and change direction when needed—like a coach who changes how hard players work every night. You don’t want to keep doing a habit if it’s not helping you.

I use two main ways to reflect and review. Every December, I do an Annual Review where I think about the past year. I count my habits, like how many articles I wrote, workouts I did, or new places I visited. Then, I ask myself three questions: 1. What went well this year?

2. What didn’t go well?

3. What did I learn?

Six months later, in the summer, I do an Integrity Report.

Everyone makes mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me see where I messed up and pushes me to get back on track. It’s a time to think about my core values and if I’ve been living by them. I think about who I am and how I can become the person I want to be. My Integrity Report answers three questions: 1. What are the core values that guide my life and work?

2. How am I living and working honestly right now?

3. How can I set higher goals for the future?

These two reports don’t take long—just a few hours each year—but they are very important. They stop me from slipping without noticing. They remind me to think about who I want to be and how my habits help me get there. They show me when to improve my habits, take on new challenges, or slow down and focus on the basics.
