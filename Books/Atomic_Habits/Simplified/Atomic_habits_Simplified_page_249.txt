This is also called a “Ulysses pact” or a “Ulysses contract.” It gets its name from Ulysses, the hero in The Odyssey. He told his sailors to tie him to the ship’s mast so he could listen to the Sirens’ beautiful song but wouldn’t be able to steer the ship toward them and crash on the rocks.

Ulysses understood that it’s smart to lock in your future actions when your mind is clear instead of waiting to see what you want in the moment.
