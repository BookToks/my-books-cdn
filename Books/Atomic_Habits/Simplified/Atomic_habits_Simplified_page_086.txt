Every product is made with the perfect mix of salt, sugar, and fat that tricks your brain and makes you want more. Because of this, you end up eating too much since these super tasty foods grab your brain’s attention. Stephan Guyenet, a brain expert who studies eating and weight gain, says, “We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.” The modern food industry and the way it encourages overeating is an example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more appealing something is, the more likely it is to become a habit.

Look around you. Our world is full of things that are more exciting than what our ancestors had. Stores use mannequins with exaggerated body shapes to sell clothes. Social media gives you more “likes” and compliments in minutes than you might get at work or home. Online porn shows scenes faster and more exciting than real life. Ads use perfect lighting, makeup, and Photoshop so even the models don’t look like themselves in the pictures. These are called supernormal stimuli. They make things look even more attractive than they really are, and our instincts go crazy. This makes us shop too much, spend too much time on social media, watch too much porn, eat too much, and more.

If history shows us anything, future temptations will be even more attractive than today’s. Rewards will become stronger, and things will be even more tempting. Junk food has way more calories than natural food. Hard liquor has more alcohol than beer. Video games are more exciting than board games. These intense pleasures are hard to resist. Our brains are the same as our ancestors’, but now we face temptations they never had.

If you want to make a behavior happen more often, you need to make it attractive. In this discussion about the 2nd Law, the goal is to make habits impossible to ignore. Even though not every habit can be super exciting, we can make any habit better. To do that, we first need to understand what a craving is and how it works.

We start by looking at something all habits share—a spike in dopamine.
