Chapter Summary Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.
 
 Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.
 
 The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.
 
 Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.
