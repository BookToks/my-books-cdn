1. After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened yesterday (need).
 
 2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).
 
 If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls: 1. After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential clients (need).
 
 2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).
 
 If you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more: 1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).
 
 2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).
 
 The hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest sports news or check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means you get to do the thing you want to do.
 
 We began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action. Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want. Engineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise.
