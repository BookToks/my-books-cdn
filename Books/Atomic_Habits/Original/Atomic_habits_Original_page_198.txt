Little Lessons from the Four Laws I , I have introduced a four-step model for human behavior: cue, craving, N THIS BOOK response, reward. This framework not only teaches us how to create new habits but also reveals some interesting insights about human behavior.
 
 Problem phase 1. Cue 2. Craving Solution phase 3. Response 4. Reward In this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of common sense) that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these examples is to clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing human behavior. Once you understand the model, you’ll see examples of it everywhere.
 
 Awareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.
 
 Happiness is simply the absence of desire. When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation.

 Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.
 
 However, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As Caed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.
 
 It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be
