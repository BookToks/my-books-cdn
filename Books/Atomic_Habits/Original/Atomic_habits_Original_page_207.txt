Notes I , I have included a detailed list of notes, references, and citations for N THIS SECTION each chapter in the book. I trust that most readers will find this list to be sufficient. However, I also realize that scientific literature changes over time and the references for this book may need to be updated. Furthermore, I fully expect that I have made a mistake somewhere in this bookâ€”either in attributing an idea to the wrong person or not giving credit to someone where it is due. (If you believe this to be the case, please email me at james@jamesclear.com so I can fix the issue as soon as possible.) In addition to the notes below, you can find a full list of updated endnotes and corrections at atomichabits.com/endnotes.
