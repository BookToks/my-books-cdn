 “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences”: This is an abbreviated version of the original quote from Thorndike, which reads: “responses that produce a satisfying effect in a particular situation become more likely to occur again in that situation, and responses that produce a discomforting effect become less likely to occur again in that situation.” For more, see Peter Gray, Psychology, 6th ed. (New York: Worth, 2011), 108–109.
