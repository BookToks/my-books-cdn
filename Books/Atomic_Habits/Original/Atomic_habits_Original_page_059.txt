5 The Best Way to Start a New Habit I , in Great Britain began working with 248 people to build better N 2001 RESEARCHERS exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The subjects were divided into three groups.
 
 The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to track how often they exercised.
 
 The second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not only to track their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits of exercise.
 
 The researchers also explained to the group how exercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve heart health.
 
 Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when and where they would exercise over the following week. Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].” In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate.
 
 The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.
 
 That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.
 
 The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.
