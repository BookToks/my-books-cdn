15 The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change I a public health worker named Stephen Luby left his hometown of N THE LATE 1990S, Omaha, Nebraska, and bought a one-way ticket to Karachi, Pakistan.
 
 Karachi was one of the most populous cities in the world. By 1998, over nine million people called it home. It was the economic center of Pakistan and a transportation hub, with some of the most active airports and seaports in the region. In the commercial parts of town, you could find all of the standard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets. But Karachi was also one of the least livable cities in the world.
 
 Over 60 percent of Karachiâ€™s residents lived in squatter settlements and slums.
 
 These densely packed neighborhoods were filled with makeshift houses cobbled together from old boards, cinder blocks, and other discarded materials. There was no waste removal system, no electricity grid, no clean water supply. When dry, the streets were a combination of dust and trash. When wet, they became a muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies thrived in pools of stagnant water, and children played among the garbage.
 
 The unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.
 
 Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there were malnourished.
 
 With so many people crammed into such a small space, viruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly. It was this public health crisis that had brought Stephen Luby to Pakistan.
 
 Luby and his team realized that in an environment with poor sanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands could make a real difference in the health of the residents. But they soon discovered that many people were already aware that handwashing was important.
 
 And yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their hands in a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands under the water
