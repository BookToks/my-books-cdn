habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine can make a big difference. If you’re trying to add meditation into your morning routine but mornings are chaotic and your kids keep running into the room, then that may be the wrong place and time. Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else.
 
 Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit. If you want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habit that only happens on Mondays, that’s not a good choice.
 
 One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits Scorecard from the last chapter as a starting point. Alternatively, you can create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the habits you do each day without fail.* For example: Get out of bed.
 
 Take a shower.
 
 Brush your teeth.
 
 Get dressed.
 
 Brew a cup of coffee.
 
 Eat breakfast.
 
 Take the kids to school.
 
 Start the work day.
 
 Eat lunch.
 
 End the work day.
 
 Change out of work clothes.
 
 Sit down for dinner.
 
 Turn off the lights.
 
 Get into bed.
 
 Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail. For example: The sun rises.
 
 You get a text message.
