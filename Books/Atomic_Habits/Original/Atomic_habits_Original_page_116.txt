FIGURE 11: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold—the habit line—the behavior can be done more or less without thinking.
 
 A new habit has been formed.
 
 On the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers track the level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten minutes each day.
 
 The shape of these charts, which scientists call learning curves, reveals an important truth about behavior change: habits form based on frequency, not time.
