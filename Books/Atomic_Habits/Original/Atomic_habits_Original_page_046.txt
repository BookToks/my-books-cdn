previous moment.
 
 We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire.
 
 Problem phase 1. Cue 2. Craving Solution phase 3. Response 4. Reward All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.
 
 In the table on the following page, you can see a few examples of what this looks like in real life.
 
 Imagine walking into a dark room and flipping on the light switch. You have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurs without thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the fraction of a second. The urge to act strikes you without thinking.
 
 Problem phase 1. Cue: Your phone buzzes with a new text message.
 
 2. Craving: You want to learn the contents of the message.
 
 Solution phase 3. Response: You grab your phone and read the text.
 
 4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes associated with your phone buzzing.
 
 Problem phase 1. Cue: You are answering emails.
 
 2. Craving: You begin to feel stressed and overwhelmed by work. You want to feel in control.
 
 Solution phase 3. Response: You bite your nails.
 
 4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to reduce stress. Biting your nails becomes associated with answering email.
