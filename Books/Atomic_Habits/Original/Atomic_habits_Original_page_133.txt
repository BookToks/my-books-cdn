Starting to Exercise Phase 1: Change into workout clothes.
 
 Phase 2: Step out the door (try taking a walk).
 
 Phase 3: Drive to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave.
 
 Phase 4: Exercise for fifteen minutes at least once per week.
 
 Phase 5: Exercise three times per week.
 
 Nearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minute behavior. I want to live a healthy and long life > I need to stay in shape > I need to exercise > I need to change into my workout clothes. I want to have a happy marriage > I need to be a good partner > I should do something each day to make my partner’s life easier > I should meal plan for next week.
 
 Whenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ the TwoMinute Rule. It’s a simple way to make your habits easy.
