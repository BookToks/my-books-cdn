 Change can take years—before it happens all at once.
 
 Mastery requires patience.

And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.
 
 But what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to survive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other side? What is it that
