 T much for taking the time to read this book. It has been a pleasure HANK YOU SO sharing my work with you. If you are looking for something to read next, allow me to offer a suggestion.
 
 If you enjoyed Atomic Habits, then you may like my other writing as well. My latest articles are sent out in my free weekly newsletter. Subscribers are also the first to hear about my newest books and projects. Finally, in addition to my own work, each year I send out a reading list of my favorite books from other authors on a wide range of subjects.
