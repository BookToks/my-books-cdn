And then they run from hedge to hedge Until they come to London Bridge.
 
 Paul’s steeple is gone, and I do not know at what date the hedges disappeared between St Paul’s and London Bridge. It is many centuries since the little boys of London town could enjoy such pleasures as this rhyme suggests, but until not so very long ago the bulk of the population lived in the country.
 
 The towns were not very vast; it was easy to get out of them, and by no means uncommon to find gardens attached to many houses in them.
 
 Nowadays there is in England an immense preponderance of the urban over the rural population. In America this preponderance is as yet slight, but it is very rapidly increasing. Cities like London and New York are so large that it takes a very long time to get out of them. Those who live in the city usually have to be content with a flat, to which, of course, not a square inch of soil is attached, and in which people of moderate means have to be content with the absolute minimum of space.
