This vicious circle is only too apt to end in a breakdown. What is restful about external interests is the fact that they do not call for any action.
 
 Making decisions and exercising volition are very fatiguing, especially if they have to be done hurriedly and without the help of the subconscious.
 
 Men who feel that they must ‘sleep on it’ before coming to an important decision are profoundly right. But it is not only in sleep that the subconscious mental processes can work. They can work also while a man’s conscious mind is occupied elsewhere. The man who can forget his work when it is over and not remember it until it begins again next day is likely to do his work far better than the man who worries about it throughout the intervening hours. And it is very much easier to forget work at the times when it ought to be forgotten if a man has many interests other than his work than it is if he has not. It is, however, essential that these interests should not exercise those very faculties which have been exhausted by his day’s work.
