‘Yes,’ says the envious man, ‘this is a sunny day, and it is springtime, and the birds are singing, and the flowers are in bloom, but I understand that the springtime in Sicily is a thousand times more beautiful, that the birds sing more exquisitely in the groves of Helicon, and that the rose of Sharon is more lovely than any in my garden.’ And as he thinks these thoughts the sun is dimmed, and the birds’ song becomes a meaningless twitter, and the flowers seem not worth a moment’s regard. All the other joys of life he treats in the same way. ‘Yes,’ he will say to himself, ‘the lady of my heart is lovely, I love her and she loves me, but how much more exquisite must have been the Queen of Sheba!
 
 Ah, if I had but had Solomon’s opportunities! ‘ All such comparisons are pointless and foolish; whether the Queen of Sheba or our next-door neighbour be the cause of discontent, either is equally futile. With the wise man, what he has does not cease to be enjoyable because someone else has something else.
