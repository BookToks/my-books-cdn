Chapter 2: Byronic Unhappiness

Today, like in many times before, some people believe that the wise have figured out that all the excitement of the past was pointless and that life has nothing worth living for. These people are truly unhappy, but they are also proud of being unhappy. They think this sadness is because of how the universe works and believe it’s the only smart way to feel.

Because they seem proud of being sad, others don’t always believe they are really unhappy. They think if someone likes feeling miserable, they probably aren’t really miserable at all.

This idea is too simple. Sure, these sad people might feel a little better because they think they understand more than others, but that doesn’t make up for missing out on simple joys. I don’t believe being unhappy is smarter or better.

A wise person will be as happy as they can be. If thinking about the universe makes them too sad, they will just think about something else instead.
