True happiness mostly comes from having a friendly interest in people and things.

Having a friendly interest in people means caring about them in a kind way, but not in a way that is controlling or always wanting them to show strong feelings back. That kind of controlling care often causes unhappiness. 

The kind of care that brings happiness is when you enjoy watching people and like their unique qualities. You want them to enjoy their own interests and fun without trying to control them or make them admire you a lot. 

A person who feels this way about others will bring happiness to them and will get kindness in return. Their relationships, whether close or casual, will make them feel happy and cared for. They won’t get upset by people being ungrateful because it won’t happen much, and if it does, they won’t pay much attention to it.
