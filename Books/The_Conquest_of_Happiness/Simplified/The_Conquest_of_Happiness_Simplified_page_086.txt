For a regular person who can’t change the laws and rules they live under, it’s hard to deal with the strict and controlling people who keep those rules going.

It’s important to understand that wild and exciting fun doesn’t lead to true happiness. But if better, more meaningful joys seem out of reach, a person might feel like they need excitement just to get through life.

In that case, the smartest thing to do is to limit how much exciting fun they have. They shouldn’t let it wear them out or mess up their health or work.

The real fix for young people’s problems is to change the way society thinks about right and wrong.

Until that happens, a young person should remember that one day they’ll be able to get married. It’s not smart to live in a way that makes a happy marriage impossible, which can happen if they get too stressed or lose the ability to enjoy calm, simple pleasures.
