Giving up alone is not a way to get rich in Western countries.

Most people in the West want more than just enough money to live. They want to feel successful. In some jobs, like scientific research, people can feel successful even if they don’t make a lot of money. But in most jobs, how much money you make shows if you are successful or not. Because the world is very competitive, only a few people can be really successful, so sometimes it’s okay to accept that.

Getting married might take some effort, or it might not, depending on the situation. If one gender is smaller in number, like men in England or women in Australia, it’s usually easier for that group to find a partner if they want to.
