When a train needs to start at a certain time, you can’t get the porters, the driver, and the signalman excited by loud, wild music. They have to do their jobs just because it’s necessary. They don’t feel like doing it for fun; they do it because they want the reward that comes later.

A lot of social life is like this. People talk to each other not because they really want to, but because they hope something good will come from working together.

In everyday life, people can’t always act on their feelings. If someone feels happy, they can’t just sing or dance in the street. If they feel sad, they can’t sit on the sidewalk and cry because it might get in the way of people walking. When you’re young, you have rules at school, and as an adult, you have rules at work. These limits make it harder to enjoy life, because always holding back can make you feel tired and bored.

Still, living in a civilized society needs a lot of control over what people feel like doing right away. If everyone just acted on impulse, we would only get simple teamwork. But today’s complicated economy needs much more careful cooperation.
