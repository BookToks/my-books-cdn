In a perfect world, kindness would be a big part of how people and groups treat each other. But since that’s far from reality, we don’t need to focus too much on it now. Still, everyone needs kindness, especially kids, because they are helpless and small, and some mean people look down on them.

Now, about the main topic of this book: being a parent today is only truly joyful if you deeply respect your child. If you do, you won’t feel annoyed by having less control, and you won’t be scared when your kids become independent. 

Parents who respect their kids find more happiness in raising them than parents who try to control everything. This kind of loving kindness makes everyday life feel special and wonderful, way more than the tough control some parents try to keep.
