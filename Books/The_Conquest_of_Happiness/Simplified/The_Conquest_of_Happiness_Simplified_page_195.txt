I have known guys who were totally focused on learning everything about the Gnostic heresy, and others who were mainly interested in comparing old copies of Hobbes’ writings. You can’t really guess what will catch someone’s attention, but most people can get really interested in something. Once they do, their life stops being boring.

But having a super specific interest isn’t as good for happiness as just loving life in general. That’s because a hobby can only take up part of your time, and there’s a risk you might learn everything there is to know about it.

Remember, at the banquet we talked about different types of people, including the gormandiser, who we didn’t want to praise. You might think the person with zest for life we’ve been talking about isn’t really different from the gormandiser.
