Fun activities shouldn’t need quick decisions or strong willpower. They also shouldn’t involve money like gambling. Usually, they shouldn’t be so exciting that they make you feel tired or keep you thinking about them all the time.

Many hobbies fit these rules. Watching sports, going to the theater, and playing golf are all good examples. For someone who likes reading, reading for fun (not work) is also a great way to relax. No matter how big a problem is, you shouldn’t think about it all day long.

There is a big difference between men and women here. Men usually find it easier to forget about work than women do. For women who work at home, this makes sense because they don’t get a change of place like men do when leaving the office. This change helps men switch their mindset. But even women who work outside the home seem to have a harder time forgetting work than men.
