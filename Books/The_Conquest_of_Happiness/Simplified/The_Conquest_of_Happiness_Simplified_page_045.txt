In some countries, there is a class of rich and powerful people called the aristocracy. In all countries, there are smart professionals like doctors and lawyers, and in most countries, the army and navy are highly respected.

It’s true that people compete to succeed in any job. But what people really respect is not just success, but being excellent at what you do. A scientist might make money or not, but that doesn’t change how much respect they get. It’s normal for famous generals or admirals to be poor, and sometimes being poor in those jobs is even seen as honorable. Because of this, in Europe, fighting just for money happens mostly in certain groups, and these groups are not always the most respected.

In America, things are different. The army and navy don’t have a big role in everyday life, so their values don’t affect people much. Also, it’s hard for outsiders to know if doctors or lawyers really are good at their jobs. Because of this, people often judge how good they are by how much money they seem to make.
