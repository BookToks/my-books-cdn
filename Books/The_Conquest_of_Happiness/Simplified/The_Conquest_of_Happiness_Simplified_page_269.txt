Chapter 15: Impersonal interests

In this chapter, I want to talk about the small interests that people have. These are not the big things that shape a person’s life, but the little things that help them relax and take a break from serious worries.

For most people, their main concerns are their wife and kids, their job, and money. Even if someone has secret love affairs outside their marriage, those usually matter less than how they might affect their family.

I’m not including work-related interests as impersonal here. For example, a scientist needs to keep up with research in their own field. They care a lot about this because it’s important for their career. But if they read about research in a different science they don’t work in, they do it in a different way—less seriously, less carefully, and with less personal interest.
