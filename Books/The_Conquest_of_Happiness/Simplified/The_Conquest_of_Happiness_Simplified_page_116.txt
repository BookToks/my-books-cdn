Whenever you start feeling guilty about something that your brain tells you isn’t actually wrong, think carefully about why you feel that way and prove to yourself that those feelings don’t make sense. Make your beliefs clear and strong so they can affect your deeper thoughts, even the ones formed when you were a baby from what your parents or caregivers taught you.

Don’t settle for switching between being logical and being confused. Look closely at the confusing feelings, decide not to respect them, and don’t let them control you. When silly thoughts or feelings pop into your mind, pull them out, study them, and throw them away.

Don’t let yourself be someone who keeps changing between reason and childish ideas. Don’t be scared to question the people who took care of you when you were little. They seemed smart and powerful back then because you were young and didn’t know much. Now that you’re older and wiser, it’s your job to think about whether they really deserve the respect you still give them just out of habit.
