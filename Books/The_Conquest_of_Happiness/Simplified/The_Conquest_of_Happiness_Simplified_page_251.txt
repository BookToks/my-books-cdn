A mother who is usually called self-sacrificing is often actually very selfish with her children. Being a parent is important, but it isn’t enough if it becomes the only thing in life. A parent who feels unhappy because of this might become too controlling or needy.

Because of this, it’s important for both the children and the mother that being a mom doesn’t stop her from having other interests and activities. 

If a mother really loves taking care of kids and knows enough to care for her own children well, she should use her skills more. She could even work professionally with a group of children that includes her own kids.

It’s fair that parents, as long as they meet the basic rules set by the State, should have a say in how their kids are cared for and by whom. But they should only choose people who are qualified.
