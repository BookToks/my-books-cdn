There’s no limit to how you can feel better about small problems by using funny comparisons and strange examples. Everyone, I guess, has an idea of who they are and gets upset when something messes up that idea.

The best way to handle this is to have not just one idea, but a whole collection of ideas about yourself, and pick the one that fits the situation. If some of these ideas seem a little silly, that’s actually good; it’s not smart to always see yourself as a serious hero. I’m not saying you should always think of yourself as a joke either, because that can be annoying too. You need to choose the role that matches what’s happening.

Of course, if you can forget about yourself and not act like any role at all, that’s great. But if acting like someone else is something you do all the time, think of it like you’re an actor with many roles, so life doesn’t get boring.
