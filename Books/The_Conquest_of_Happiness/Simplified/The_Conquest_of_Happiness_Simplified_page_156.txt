The goal is to find ways to make this hatred as small and weak as possible.

Today, this problem mostly happens with young people. If someone starts the right job and is in a good environment, they can usually avoid being treated badly by others. But when they are young and haven’t proven themselves yet, they can be judged by people who don’t really understand and think they know better. These people get upset if a young person seems smarter than them, even if they have more life experience.

Many people who finally break free from this unfair treatment have had to fight really hard and deal with a lot of unfairness. Because of this, they often feel bitter and lose some of their energy. Some people believe that talent will always succeed no matter what, so they think that treating young talented people badly doesn’t cause much harm.
