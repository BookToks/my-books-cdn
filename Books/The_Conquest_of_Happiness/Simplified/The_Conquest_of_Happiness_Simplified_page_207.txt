They say they like to keep to themselves, meaning they don’t really care about other people and think that’s a good thing. This isn’t really their fault; they are just following ideas about women that have been around for thousands of years.

These women are actually victims of a system that controls and limits them, but they don’t realize how unfair it is. To them, anything that seems selfish looks good, and anything kind or generous seems bad.

In their own groups, they try to ruin fun, and in politics, they support strict and controlling laws. Luckily, fewer women are like this now, but there are still more than most people in free-thinking groups realize.

If you don’t believe me, try visiting several places where people rent rooms and pay attention to the landladies you meet while looking for a place to stay.
