Because of this, all the snobby feelings get more restless than when society stays the same. Even though money alone might not make someone seem important, it's hard to be important without money.

Also, making money is seen as a sign of being smart. If a guy makes a lot of money, people think he’s clever; if he doesn’t, they think he’s not. No one wants to be seen as dumb. So, when the market is unstable, a person feels nervous, kind of like how teens feel during a test.

I think we should admit that real but sometimes unfair fear about failing often worries businesspeople. Arnold Bennett’s character Clayhanger, even after becoming rich, was still scared of ending up poor. I believe people who grew up very poor are often scared their kids will be poor too, and they think it’s almost impossible to make enough money to stop that from happening. These fears probably happen mostly to the first generation who were poor, and less to those who never experienced great poverty.
