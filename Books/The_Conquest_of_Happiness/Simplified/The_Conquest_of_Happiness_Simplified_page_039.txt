Think about the life of this man. He probably has a nice house, a nice wife, and nice kids. He wakes up early in the morning while they are still sleeping and rushes to his office.  

At work, he has to act like a strong leader; he tries to look serious, speak clearly, and seem smart to impress everyone except the office boy. He writes letters, talks to important people on the phone, studies the market, and then has lunch with someone he is trying to make a deal with.  

The same kind of thing happens all afternoon. He gets home tired, just in time to get ready for dinner. At dinner, he and some other tired men have to pretend they enjoy being with women who arenâ€™t tired yet.
