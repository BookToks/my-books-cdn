Zest needs more energy than just what is needed for regular work, and this requires our mind to work smoothly. I will talk more about what helps the mind work well in later chapters.

For women, less now than before but still a lot, zest has been lowered by wrong ideas about being "respectable." People thought it was bad for women to show clear interest in men or to be very lively in public. When women learned not to care about men, they often ended up not caring about much else either, except acting in a "proper" way.

Teaching women to be inactive and withdrawn from life hurts their zest. It also encourages them to focus too much on themselves, which is common in very "respectable" women, especially if they didn’t get much education. They usually don’t enjoy sports like most men do, don’t care about politics, act very distant toward men, and look at other women with hidden dislike because they think those women are less respectable.
