Nothing is really boring when you only think about yourself, but it feels exciting when you focus your attention and energy on things outside yourself.

Our usual ideas about right and wrong have been too focused on ourselves, and the idea of sin is part of this mistaken focus on self. People who have never felt the bad feelings this wrong way of thinking causes might not need reason. But for those who have felt this "sickness," reason is needed to help them get better. Maybe going through this sickness is an important part of growing mentally. I think that someone who has moved past it with the help of reason is more mature than someone who never went through the sickness or the cure. 

Many people today don’t like reason because they don’t understand how basic and important it really is.
