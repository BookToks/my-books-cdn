For some people, being a parent is really important. If they don’t have this, only a very special person can be happy. But if they do have it, or can work to get it, then a person who’s still unhappy might have some mental problems. If these problems are very bad, they might need a doctor who knows about the mind. But usually, people can fix these problems themselves if they try the right way.

If a person’s life isn’t really bad, they should be able to be happy. This happens when they focus on things outside themselves, not just on their own feelings. So, in school and in life, we should try not to be selfish or always think about ourselves. Instead, we should care about others and have interests that stop us from constantly thinking about ourselves.

Most people don’t feel happy when they feel trapped like they are in a prison. The feelings that keep us stuck inside our own heads are one of the worst kinds of prisons.
