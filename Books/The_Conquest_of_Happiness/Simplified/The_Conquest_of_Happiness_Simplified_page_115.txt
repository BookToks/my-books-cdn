The problem here is the same as we talked about before: getting your unconscious mind to pay attention to the logical beliefs that control your conscious thinking. People shouldn’t let their feelings control them, believing one thing one moment and something else the next.

Feeling guilty is especially strong when your willpower is weak because you’re tired, sick, drunk, or for some other reason.

What a person feels at these times (if not caused by alcohol) is supposed to come from their higher self. But it’s silly to think that you understand things better when you’re weak than when you’re strong. When you’re weak, it’s hard to resist childish thoughts, but there’s no reason to think those thoughts are better than what a mature person believes when they’re fully in control.

In fact, what a person fully believes with clear thinking when they’re strong should be the standard for what they believe all the time. It’s possible to overcome childish unconscious thoughts and even change what’s in your unconscious mind by using the right methods.
