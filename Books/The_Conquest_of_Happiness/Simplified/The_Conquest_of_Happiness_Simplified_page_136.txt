Feeling upset and let down, he leaves the world after the world has turned away from him, and wishes he never tried such a thankless job as trying to help the public.

These examples show four important rules that can help stop people from feeling like they are being unfairly treated if they really understand them. The first is: remember that your reasons for doing things might not be as selfless as you think. The second is: don’t think too highly of your own good qualities. The third is: don’t expect others to care about you as much as you care about yourself.

And the fourth is: don’t believe that most people think about you enough to want to treat you badly. I will explain a little about each of these rules one by one.

It’s especially important to question your own reasons if you want to help others or lead. These people have an idea of how the world should be, and they sometimes feel, rightly or wrongly, that making their idea real will be a big help to people.
