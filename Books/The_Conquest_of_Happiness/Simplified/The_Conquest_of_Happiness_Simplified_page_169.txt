People who are highly educated can feel the same kind of happiness as my gardener, at least in terms of emotions. The only difference is how they find these pleasures through their activities. Achieving something often means facing tough challenges that make success seem unlikely at first, but usually it happens in the end.

This is why having a fair idea of your own abilities can make you happy. Someone who thinks less of themselves is often surprised by success, while someone who thinks too highly of themselves is often surprised by failure. Being surprised by success feels good, but being surprised by failure does not. So, itâ€™s smart not to be too full of yourself, but also not too shy to try new things.

Among well-educated people today, scientists are often the happiest. Many of the best scientists are emotionally simple and find deep satisfaction in their work, so much that they can also enjoy simple things like eating and getting married.
