For kids, even more than for adults, it’s really important to stay connected with the natural world around them. Our bodies have gotten used to this natural rhythm over a long time, and religion shows some of this in the celebration of Easter.

I once saw a two-year-old boy who had only lived in London go outside to walk in the countryside for the first time. It was winter, and everything was wet and muddy. To adults, there wasn’t much to be happy about, but the boy felt a strange kind of happiness. He knelt down in the wet ground, put his face in the grass, and made happy sounds that weren’t quite words yet. 

The joy he felt was simple, strong, and natural. This deep need to connect with nature is so important that people who don’t get it often don’t feel completely normal.

Many fun activities, like gambling, don’t have any of this connection with the Earth.
