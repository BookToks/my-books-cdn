This rule is most clear when we talk about building and destroying buildings. When you build a building, you follow a plan that was made before. But when you destroy a building, no one decides exactly how the broken pieces will look after.

Destroying a building is often needed before building something new. In that case, destroying is part of the building process. But sometimes, a person destroys things just to destroy, without thinking about building anything afterward.

Often, people trick themselves by saying they are only clearing the way to build again. But you can usually see through this by asking what they plan to build next. When asked, they will give unclear answers and donâ€™t seem excited about building. But they have talked clearly and excitedly about the destruction before.
