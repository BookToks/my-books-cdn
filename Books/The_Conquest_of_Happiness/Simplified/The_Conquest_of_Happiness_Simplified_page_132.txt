There is an inventor who has never been able to get anyone to look at his invention. Manufacturers don’t want to change how they do things, and the few who do keep their own inventors to block outsiders. Even smart groups lose or ignore his papers, and people he asks for help don’t respond.

How can this happen? It seems like there is a group of people who want to share all the benefits from new inventions. If you’re not part of this group, no one listens to you.

Then, there is a person who has a real problem based on facts but thinks his bad experience explains everything. For example, he finds out about some secret government scandal that they want to hide. He can’t get the news out, and even people who seem to care won’t help fix the problem that makes him so angry.
