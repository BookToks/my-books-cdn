I’m not saying that during a big crisis, like when everything is about to fall apart or if someone thinks their partner is cheating, most people can just ignore the problem when nothing can be done. Only a few very disciplined people can do that.

But it is possible to ignore normal everyday problems, except when you actually need to deal with them. It’s surprising how much happier and more productive you can be by having an organized mind that thinks about problems properly at the right time, instead of worrying about them all the time.

When you have to make a hard or worrying decision, once you have all the information, think about it carefully and decide. After you decide, don’t keep changing your mind unless you find out something new. Being undecided is really tiring and doesn’t help at all.

Many worries can become smaller if you realize the problem isn’t really that important.
