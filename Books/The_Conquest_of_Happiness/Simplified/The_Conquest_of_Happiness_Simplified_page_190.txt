My own ideas are way more interesting and amazing than any pig’s. He said no to the pig and started to study what was inside it. When the pig didn’t get its usual food, its insides stopped working, and the more he looked, the more empty and useless it seemed. All the cool parts that usually helped turn food into something tasty just stopped, and he didn’t know what they could do anymore.

This second sausage machine was like a person who lost their energy, while the first was like someone who still had it. The mind is a weird machine that can mix things it gets in the most amazing ways, but without stuff from outside, it can’t do anything. Unlike the sausage machine, the mind has to find its own stuff, because things only become real experiences if we care about them. If we don’t care, we learn nothing.

So, a person who only thinks about themselves finds nothing interesting, but someone who looks outside can find, in rare moments when they think about their own feelings, a lot of different and cool things inside their mind being put together in beautiful or helpful ways.
