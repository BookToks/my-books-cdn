Chapter 14: Work

Whether work makes people happy or unhappy is a tricky question.

Some work is really boring and too much work is always painful. But I think, as long as work isn’t too much, even the most boring jobs are better than doing nothing at all. Work can be just something to pass time or it can be deeply enjoyable, depending on the kind of work and the person doing it.

Most jobs people have aren’t very interesting, but they still have some big benefits. For one, work fills up a lot of time without you having to decide what to do. Most people, when they have free time to choose what to do, don’t know what fun thing to pick. And whatever they choose, they often feel like something else would have been more fun. Being able to use free time well is a skill that takes a lot of learning, and right now, very few people are good at it.
