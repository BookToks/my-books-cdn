In many areas of taking care of children, people don’t realize that experience is important. Sure, some things are better done by the mother, but as the child grows, more things can be done better by someone else.

If people understood this, mothers wouldn’t have to do so much hard work that they’re not trained for. A woman who has a professional skill should be able to keep using it even after having a baby.

She might not be able to work during the last months of pregnancy or while breastfeeding, but once the child is over nine months old, the baby shouldn’t stop her from working.

When society asks a mother to make unreasonable sacrifices for her child, the mother, unless she’s extremely patient, will expect more from her child than is fair.
