It’s better to have a pure heart than just to be careful. A parent who truly cares about their child’s well-being more than having control won’t need to study psychology books to know what to do. They will just follow their natural feelings.

When this happens, the relationship between parent and child will be good from the start to the end. The child won’t feel like rebelling, and the parent won’t feel frustrated.

But for this to happen, the parent must respect the child’s personality from the very beginning. This respect can’t just be an idea or rule; it has to be something they really believe in deeply. When that happens, the parent won’t try to control or boss the child around.

This kind of attitude isn’t only good for parents and children. It’s also very important in marriage and friendships, though it’s easier to have in friendships.
