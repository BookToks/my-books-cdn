People used to be more afraid of their neighbors, but now they are more scared of what newspapers might say about them. This fear is just as bad as the scary witch-hunts from long ago. When a newspaper picks someone to blame, even if that person hasn’t done anything wrong, it can cause a lot of harm.

Luckily, most people don’t get caught up in this because they are not famous or well-known. But as news spreads faster and easier, this new kind of social bullying will become more dangerous. This is a serious problem that victims can’t just ignore.

No matter what people think about freedom of the press, there need to be stronger rules than the current laws about lying in the news. Anything that makes life unbearable for innocent people should be banned, especially if the news is twisted to make them look bad on purpose.
