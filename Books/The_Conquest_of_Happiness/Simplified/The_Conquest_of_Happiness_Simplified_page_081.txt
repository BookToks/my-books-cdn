Before I learned this method, I used to spend the months in between worrying because I wasn’t making any progress. Worrying didn’t help me solve the problem faster, and those months were wasted. Now, I can use that time for other things.

You can do something similar with worries. When something bad might happen, think carefully about the worst thing that could actually happen.

After you imagine the worst, remind yourself why it wouldn’t be as terrible as it seems. There are always good reasons for this because, in the grand scheme of things, nothing bad that happens to you is that important.

If you keep thinking about the worst case and tell yourself honestly, “Well, that wouldn’t be so bad,” you’ll notice your worry gets a lot smaller. You might have to do this a few times, but if you really face your biggest fear, your worry will go away completely and you’ll even feel a bit excited.
