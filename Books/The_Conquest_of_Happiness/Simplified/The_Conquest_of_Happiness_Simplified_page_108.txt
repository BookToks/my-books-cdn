Some people forget about their bad actions when they think they won’t get caught. But when they do get caught or almost caught, they wish they had behaved better. This wish can make them really understand how wrong their actions were.

This feeling is connected to the fear of being rejected by others. A person who cheats at cards or doesn’t pay back what they owe has no inner strength to face people’s disappointment when they are found out. 

This is different from people like religious rebels, anarchists, or revolutionaries. These people believe that even if others don’t like them now, the future will respect and honor them. 

Because of this, they don’t feel guilty even if many people are against them. But someone who agrees with what most people think is right, yet acts against it, feels very unhappy when others reject them. The fear or pain of being left out can make them think their actions were actually wrong.
