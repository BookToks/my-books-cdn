Chapter 5: Tiredness

There are many kinds of tiredness, and some are much worse for happiness than others. Physical tiredness, if it’s not too much, can actually help you feel happy. It helps you sleep well, eat better, and enjoy fun things during holidays. But if it’s too much, it becomes a serious problem.

In places where life is hard, peasant women often look old by the time they are thirty because of too much hard work. When factories first started, children often didn’t grow properly and sometimes died because they worked too much. This still happens in countries like China and Japan, where factories are new. It also happens a little in the Southern States of America. Working too hard physically can be really painful and make life almost impossible. 

But in the most modern parts of the world, hard physical work has been made much easier because working conditions have improved a lot.
