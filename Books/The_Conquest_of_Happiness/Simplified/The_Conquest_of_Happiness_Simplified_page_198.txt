Some passions can be enjoyed a lot without causing problems, but others can’t. For example, a man who loves chess and is single with enough money doesn’t have to limit his hobby. But if he has a wife, kids, and not much money, he will have to cut back a lot.

People who drink too much or eat too much, even if they don’t have family responsibilities, are not smart because it hurts their health and makes them feel bad later, even though it feels good for a short time.

There are some important things that any passion needs to fit into so it doesn’t cause trouble. These include staying healthy, being mentally okay, having enough money for basic needs, and doing important social duties like taking care of your family.

A man who gives up these things for chess is just as bad as someone who drinks or eats too much. We don’t judge him as harshly because he is less common, and only a few people with special skills get so obsessed with such an intellectual game.
