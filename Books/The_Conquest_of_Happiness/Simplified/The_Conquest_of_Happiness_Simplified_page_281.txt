The same ideas apply to really painful losses, like when someone you love dies. It doesn’t help anyone to just stay stuck in sadness. Feeling sad is normal and expected, but we should try to keep it as small as possible. It’s not helpful to try to feel the worst possible pain from a bad situation.

I’m not saying that sadness can’t break a person, but everyone should try their best to avoid that. It’s good to find distractions, even small ones, as long as they don’t hurt you or make things worse. Things like getting drunk or using drugs are harmful because they try to stop your thoughts, at least for a little while.

Instead of stopping your thoughts, you should try to think about other things or focus on something far away from your current pain. This is hard if your life has only been about a few things, and those things are now filled with sadness.

To handle tough times better, it’s smart to have many different interests when you’re happy. That way, your mind has a safe place to go to, with different feelings and memories that can help you through the hard moments.
