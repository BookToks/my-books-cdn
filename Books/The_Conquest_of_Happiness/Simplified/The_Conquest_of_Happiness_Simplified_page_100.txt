Right now, inequality is a bad thing, but we have to put up with it to create a fairer society. When people think carefully about inequality, they see it's unfair unless it’s because someone truly deserves it.

Once people realize it's unfair, the only way to stop jealousy is to fix the unfairness. Today, jealousy is a big problem. Poor people envy rich people, poorer countries envy richer ones, women envy men, and good women envy those who do bad things but don’t get punished.

Jealousy often pushes people to fight for fairness between classes, countries, and genders. But the kind of fairness that comes from jealousy is usually the worst kind. It tries to take away the happiness of lucky people instead of helping unhappy people.

Strong feelings that cause problems in private life also cause problems in public life.
