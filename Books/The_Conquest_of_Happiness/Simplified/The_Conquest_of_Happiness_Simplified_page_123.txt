Finding ways to reduce hate and jealousy is definitely part of what a smart mind should do. But it’s wrong to think that by lowering these feelings, we will also make other strong feelings weaker.

Feelings like passionate love, caring for family, friendship, kindness, and dedication to science or art are all good. Reason doesn’t want to make these feelings less strong. A smart person who has these feelings will be happy about them and won’t try to weaken them. These feelings are part of a good life, a life that brings happiness to yourself and to others.

Passions themselves are not irrational, and some people who aren’t very rational only feel small, unimportant passions. No one should worry that becoming more rational will make life boring. In fact, being rational mostly means having peace inside yourself. A person who is truly rational is freer to enjoy the world and to use their energy to reach goals, unlike someone who is always struggling with inner problems.
