Having friends and working together are really important for most people’s happiness, and you can find these things more in factory work than in farming.

Believing in something you care about makes a lot of people happy. I’m not just talking about big things like revolutionaries, socialists, or people fighting for their country. I mean even simple beliefs. For example, the men I’ve met who thought the English were the lost ten tribes were usually happy. And those who believed the English were from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh were even happier. 

I’m not saying you should believe these things, because I don’t think they’re true. Just like I wouldn’t tell you to live only on nuts, even though people who believe that seem really happy.
