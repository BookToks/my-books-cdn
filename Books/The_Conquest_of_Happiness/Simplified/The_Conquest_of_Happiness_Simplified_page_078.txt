The problems people blame on working too much usually come from worry or stress, not the work itself. Emotional tiredness makes it hard to rest properly. The more tired someone gets, the harder it is for them to stop working.

One sign that someone might be close to a nervous breakdown is when they think their work is super important and believe taking a break would cause big problems. If I were a doctor, I would tell anyone who thinks their work is that important to take a holiday.

Most nervous breakdowns that seem to be caused by work actually come from emotional problems. People try to forget their worries by working a lot. They donâ€™t want to stop working because then they would have to face their problems.

Sometimes the worry is about money problems, like going bankrupt. In that case, work is connected to the stress, but working too much can make things worse. It can make people lose good judgment, and bankruptcy might happen faster than if they worked less.
