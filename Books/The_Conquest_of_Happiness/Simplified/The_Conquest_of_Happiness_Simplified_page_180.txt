It's easy to find something interesting that isn't strange, and people who really care about these things have something to do in their free time. This helps them stop feeling like life is boring.

Being very focused on a hobby is kind of like being devoted to a cause. One famous mathematician spends half his time doing math and the other half collecting stamps. I think stamp collecting helps him feel better when he gets stuck on hard math problems. Collecting stamps isn’t the only way to feel better either.

Think about how exciting it can be to collect old things like china, snuff-boxes, Roman coins, arrowheads, or flint tools. But many of us think we’re too “grown-up” for these simple fun activities. We all enjoyed them as kids but later decided they weren’t cool for adults.
