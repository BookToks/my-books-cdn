This bad cycle often leads to a breakdown. What’s relaxing about outside interests is that they don’t require any action.

Making decisions and choosing what to do can be really tiring, especially if you have to do it quickly and without your brain’s help.

People who feel they need to “sleep on it” before making an important choice are totally right. But it’s not only during sleep that your brain can work on problems. It can also work when your mind is focused on something else. 

Someone who can forget about their work after finishing and only think about it again the next day usually does better than someone who worries about it all the time. It’s much easier to forget about work if you have lots of other interests besides work. But it’s important that these interests don’t use up the same energy your work does.
