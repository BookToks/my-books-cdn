The man who gets things easily, even if he doesn’t want them that much, thinks that getting what you want doesn’t make you happy. If he likes to think deeply, he believes that life is basically sad because even someone who has everything is still unhappy. He forgets that not having some things you want is actually an important part of being happy.

That’s how he feels. But there are also smart ideas in Ecclesiastes.

Rivers flow into the sea, but the sea never gets full.

There is nothing new in the world.

People forget things that happened before.

I hated all the work I did in life because I knew I would leave it to someone else after me.
