The moralist, however, is too apt, though this is not, of course, universally true, to stress the act rather than the state of mind. The effects of an act upon the agent will be widely different, according to his state of mind at the moment. If you see a child drowning and save it as the result of a direct impulse to bring help, you will emerge none the worse morally. If, on the other hand, you say to yourself, ‘It is the part of virtue to succour the helpless, and I wish to be a virtuous man, therefore I must save this child’, you will be an even worse man afterwards than you were before. What applies in this extreme case applies in many other instances that are less obvious.
 
 There is another difference, somewhat more subtle, between the attitude towards life that I have been recommending and that which is recommended by the traditional moralists. The traditional moralist, for example, will say that love should be unselfish.
