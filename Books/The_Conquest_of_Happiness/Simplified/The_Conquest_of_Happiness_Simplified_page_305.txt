Moral teachers often focus too much on what people do, not on what they are thinking or feeling. How an action affects someone depends a lot on their mindset at the time. 

If you see a child drowning and save them because you just feel like helping right away, you won’t feel worse about yourself afterward. But if you save the child because you think, "I should be a good person, so I must save them," you might actually feel worse about yourself later. This idea works in many other situations too, even if it’s not so obvious.

There’s another difference between the way I am suggesting to live and what traditional moral teachers say. For example, traditional moralists often say that love should be selfless.
