Boredom happens when your mind isn’t busy enough. Running away from people trying to hurt you is scary, but it’s not boring. A person wouldn’t feel bored while being executed, unless they were really brave. Also, no one has ever yawned during their first speech in the House of Lords, except the late Duke of Devonshire, who was respected because of it. Boredom is really about wanting things to happen, not always fun things, but just something to make one day different from another. The opposite of boredom isn’t happiness, but excitement.

People, especially guys, have a strong need for excitement. I guess when people hunted for food, it was easier to get excited than it is now. Chasing animals, fighting wars, and dating were all exciting things.
