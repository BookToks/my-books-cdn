Even when there’s no competition, doing hard tasks can still feel really good. A person who can do tricks in an airplane enjoys it so much that they are even willing to risk their life for it. I think a skilled surgeon, even though their job can be tough and sometimes sad, feels proud because of how carefully they do their operations.

You can get the same kind of happiness, but less strong, from a lot of simpler jobs. I’ve even heard that some plumbers like their work, though I haven’t met one myself. Any job that needs skill can be fun, as long as the skill can change or get better over time.

If the skill doesn’t change or improve, the job will stop being interesting once a person gets as good as they can. For example, a person who runs three-mile races will stop enjoying it when they can’t beat their best time anymore. Luckily, there are many jobs where new situations need new skills, so a person can keep getting better, at least until they reach middle age.
