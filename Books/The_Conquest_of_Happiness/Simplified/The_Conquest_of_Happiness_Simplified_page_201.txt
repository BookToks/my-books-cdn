For people who are addicted to drinking, it’s clear: they drink to forget their problems. If they didn’t have bad things bothering them, they wouldn’t enjoy being drunk more than being sober. Like the old story of the Chinese man said: "I don’t drink just for drinking, I drink to get drunk." This shows how all strong and one-sided passions work. It’s not really the thing itself that makes them happy, but the escape from reality.

But there is a big difference in how people try to escape. Some find forgetfulness in healthy ways. For example, Borrow’s friend learned Chinese to cope with losing his wife. He wanted to forget his pain, but he did it by doing something good that made him smarter. There’s nothing wrong with that kind of escape.

It’s different for people who try to forget by drinking, gambling, or doing other risky things that don’t help them. Sometimes it’s hard to judge, though. What about someone who takes crazy risks flying planes or climbing mountains just because life feels boring or hard?
