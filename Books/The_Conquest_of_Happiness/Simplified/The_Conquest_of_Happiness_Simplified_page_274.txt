Why should you remember this? You might ask. There are a few reasons. First, it’s good to have a true picture of the world, as much as possible while doing what you need to do.  

Each of us only lives for a short time, and during those years, we have to learn about this strange planet and its place in the universe. Ignoring the chance to learn, even if it’s not perfect, is like going to a play and not paying attention.  

The world is full of things that are sad, funny, brave, weird, or surprising. People who don’t care about what’s happening around them miss out on one of life’s best experiences.  

Also, having a good sense of what really matters is very helpful and comforting sometimes. We all tend to get too excited, too stressed, or think our own little part of the world and time is way more important than it really is.
