Chapter 11: Zest

In this chapter, I want to talk about something that makes happy people special, which is called zest.

One way to understand zest is to look at how people act when they sit down to eat a meal.

Some people find eating boring. Even if the food is really good, they don’t enjoy it. They have had good food many times before and have never been very hungry. For them, meals are just something they have to do because everyone else does. Like other things, eating feels dull, but they don’t complain because nothing else seems more fun.

Then there are people who eat because they have to, like when a doctor tells them to eat to stay healthy. They do it out of duty, not because they like it.
