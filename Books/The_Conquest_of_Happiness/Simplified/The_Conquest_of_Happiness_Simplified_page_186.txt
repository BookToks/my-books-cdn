Chapter 11: Zest In this chapter I propose to deal with what seems to me the most universal and distinctive mark of happy men, namely zest.
 
 Perhaps the best way to understand what is meant by zest will be to consider the different ways in which men behave when they sit down to a meal.
 
 There are those to whom a meal is merely a bore; no matter how excellent the food may be, they feel that it is uninteresting. They have had excellent food before, probably at almost every meal they have eaten. They have never known what it was to go without a meal until hunger became a raging passion, but have come to regard meals as merely conventional occurrences, dictated by the fashions of the society in which they live. Like everything else, meals are tiresome, but it is no use to make a fuss, because nothing else will be less tiresome.
 
 Then there are the invalids who eat from a sense of duty, because the doctor has told them that it is necessary to take a little nourishment in order to keep up their strength.
