A lot of people spend money in ways that don’t really match what they like, just because they think their neighbors will respect them if they have a nice car or can throw fancy dinners. Actually, if someone can clearly afford a car but prefers to travel or have a good collection of books, they will be more respected in the long run than if they acted like everyone else.

Of course, there’s no point in purposely going against what most people think; that still means you care about their opinions, just in a weird way. But not caring about what others think for real makes you stronger and happier. 

A society made up of people who don’t follow the rules all the time is way more interesting than one where everyone acts the same. When everyone shows who they really are, people stay different and it’s exciting to meet new people because they aren’t just copies of someone you already know.

This was one good thing about aristocracy, where status came from birth and people could behave in unusual ways.
