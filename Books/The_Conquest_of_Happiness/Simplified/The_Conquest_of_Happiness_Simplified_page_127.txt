We all know people, guys or girls, who always say that everyone is mean, ungrateful, or betrays them. These people are usually very good at convincing others and quickly get sympathy from people who don’t know them well.  

Usually, there’s nothing impossible about the stories they tell. The bad things they say happened to them do sometimes really happen. But what makes listeners start to doubt is how many different people have treated them badly.  

Most people in a community will experience about the same amount of bad treatment in their lives. If someone says that everyone treats them badly, it’s more likely that the problem is with that person. They might imagine some of the bad things or act in ways that make others annoyed without realizing it.  

So, people with experience start to doubt those who always say the world is against them. Because of this, those unlucky people feel even more sure that everyone is against them.
