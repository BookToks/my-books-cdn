There is no doubt that the civilization created by white people has a unique trait: the more people live by its ways, the less they have children. The most civilized people have the fewest kids, while the least civilized have the most. Between these two groups, there are all kinds of levels.

Right now, the smartest groups in Western countries are having fewer children and dying out. Soon, the total number of people in Western countries will go down, except for new people coming from less civilized places. When these new people learn the ways of their new country, they will also start having fewer kids.

It’s clear that a civilization like this can’t last forever. If it doesn’t have enough children, it will eventually disappear and be replaced by another civilization where people still want to have more kids.
