Older people should help younger ones because they have lots of life experience.

Nowadays, many think that if a young person doesn’t fit in with their surroundings, it must be because of a mental problem. I think this is wrong. For example, if a young person’s parents believe that evolution is bad, the young person might disagree just because they are smart.

Not fitting in with your environment can be unlucky, but it’s not always something bad. If the people around you are unfair, mean, or close-minded, then not fitting in can actually be a good thing. Most places have some of these problems.

Famous smart people like Galileo and Kepler had ideas that were seen as dangerous, and many smart people today do too. It’s not good if people are so afraid of what others think that they stop sharing their important ideas.
