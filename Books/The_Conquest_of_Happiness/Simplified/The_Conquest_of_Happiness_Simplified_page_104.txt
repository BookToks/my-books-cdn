You can almost feel like some people want to grow up and be strong, but they don’t know how. On the path of getting better, they got lost; their cousins kept going, but they stayed behind.

Something similar seems to be happening to people today. They know there is something better than themselves close by, but they don’t know where to look or how to find it. Feeling hopeless, they get angry at others who are just as lost and unhappy.

We are at a point in our growth that is not the final step. We need to move through it fast, because if we don’t, many of us will fail, and others will get stuck in confusion and fear. Jealousy, although bad and harmful, isn’t all bad. It partly shows the pain of those who walk blindly at night, maybe toward a better place, or maybe toward danger and destruction.
