Chapter 4: Boredom and excitement

I think people don’t talk enough about boredom, even though it really affects how we act. Boredom has been a big reason for many things that happened in history, and it’s even more important today. Boredom seems to be an emotion that only humans feel.

Animals kept in cages can get tired and restless, walking back and forth and yawning. But in the wild, I don’t think animals feel bored like we do. Most of the time, they’re watching out for danger or looking for food. Sometimes, they’re trying to find a mate or stay warm. Even when they’re sad, I don’t think they get bored.

Maybe apes are like us when it comes to boredom, but I haven’t lived with them to find out. One big part of boredom is when you notice how your current situation is boring compared to something more fun that you can’t stop thinking about.
