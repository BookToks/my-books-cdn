I don’t think this is the best way because it makes people focus too much on themselves, and that’s part of the problem they need to fix. A balanced person looks outside themselves.

What I suggest is that a person should clearly decide what they truly believe and never let silly or wrong ideas stick, even for a little while. This means thinking carefully with yourself when you feel like acting childish. If your thinking is strong enough, it won’t take long at all.

Many people don’t like being logical, and if that’s how you feel, what I’m saying might not seem important.

Some people think that if you use reason too much, it will kill all your deep feelings. I believe this is a totally wrong idea about what reason is for.

Reason isn’t meant to create feelings, but it can help find ways to stop feelings that cause problems.
