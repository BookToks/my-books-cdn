Chapter 17: The happy man

Happiness depends partly on things outside of us and partly on ourselves.

In this book, we have focused on the part that depends on ourselves, and we have found that the secret to happiness is pretty simple. Some people, like Mr. Krutch who we talked about before, think that happiness can only come from having some kind of religious belief. Many unhappy people believe their sadness comes from complicated and deep reasons. I donâ€™t think those reasons really cause happiness or unhappiness; they are more like signs of how someone feels.

Usually, an unhappy person will believe in an unhappy way, and a happy person will believe in a happy way. Each might think their beliefs cause how they feel, but actually, how they feel causes their beliefs. There are some things most people need to be happy, and these are simple things: food and a place to live, good health, love, doing work that goes well, and being respected by the people around them.
