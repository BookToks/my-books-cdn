Even though love and care are important in life, we have to agree that one kind is better than the other. This less good kind depends on fear, and fear is bad. It is also more about yourself. The best kind of love is when someone looks forward to feeling happy, not just trying to avoid feeling sad.

The best kind of love gives energy to both people. Both enjoy getting love and give it easily. Because of this, the world feels more exciting and happy for both of them. But there is another kind of love that is not so good. In this kind, one person takes energy from the other without giving much back. Some very energetic people act like this. They take energy from one person after another. While they get stronger and more interesting, the people they take from become tired, dull, and lifeless.
