Losing your self-respect never helps anyone.  

A reasonable person looks at their own bad actions the same way they look at others’ bad actions. They understand these actions happen because of certain situations and should be avoided by realizing they are bad or by staying away from those situations.  

Feeling guilty or thinking you are a bad person doesn’t help you live a good life. Instead, it makes you unhappy and feel less important. When you’re unhappy, you might expect too much from other people, which can stop you from having good relationships. When you feel less important, you might be jealous of people who seem better than you. You might find it hard to admire others and easy to envy them.  

This can make you a negative person who ends up alone. But being open and kind to others not only makes them happy, it also makes you happy because people like you more.
