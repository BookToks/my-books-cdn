I have talked before about how society needs to change to help people be happier.  

I’m not going to talk in this book about stopping war, ending people taking advantage of others, or teaching cruelty and fear.  

Finding a way to stop war is very important for our world, but it won’t work if people are so unhappy that they think dying is better than living. We need to stop poverty so that the good things machines make can help those who need it most. But what’s the point of making everyone rich if even the rich people are unhappy? Teaching cruelty and fear is bad, but those who feel scared and angry can’t teach in a better way.  

These ideas bring us to one big question: what can a person do right now, living in our society, to find happiness for themselves?
