Most of all, it’s because I stopped thinking about myself so much.

Like others who grew up with a strict religious education, I used to spend a lot of time thinking about my mistakes and flaws. I thought I was pretty terrible.

Slowly, I learned to stop caring so much about my faults. Instead, I started paying more attention to things outside myself: what’s happening in the world, learning new stuff, and people I care about. 

Sure, caring about outside things can bring pain too: there might be wars, some knowledge might be hard to get, or friends might pass away.

But these kinds of pain don’t ruin life like feeling disgusted with yourself does. And when you care about things outside yourself, it keeps you busy and stops boredom. Caring only about yourself, on the other hand, doesn’t help you grow or do anything new.
