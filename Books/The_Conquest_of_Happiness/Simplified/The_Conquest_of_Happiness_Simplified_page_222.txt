All this often makes people feel shy and angry at others, because many miss something very important in life. This is something almost everyone needs to be happy and open to the world.

It’s not true that people who are called immoral are better at this than those who are not. In many sexual relationships, there is often little real love. Sometimes, there is even basic dislike between people.

Each person tries not to show their true self, keeping their loneliness inside, and staying unchanged and empty inside. These kinds of experiences don’t have real meaning.

I’m not saying people should avoid these kinds of relationships completely, because trying to do that might stop them from finding deeper love. But I do believe that the only sexual relationships that really matter are the ones where both people are open and their whole personalities come together as one.
