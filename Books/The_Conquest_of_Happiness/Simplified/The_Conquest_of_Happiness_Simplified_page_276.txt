Imagine you’re really into a political fight and you work hard to help your favorite team win. That’s fine. But sometimes, during the fight, you might see a chance to win by doing things that make people hate each other, cause violence, or make everyone suspicious.

For example, you might think the easiest way to win is by saying bad things about another country. If you only care about winning right now, or believe that being efficient is the most important thing, you might choose to do this.

You could win the fight quickly, but the long-term effects might be very bad. But if you remember how humans have slowly grown out of a dark and violent past, and think about how short our time on Earth really is, you’ll understand that this small fight isn’t worth risking going backwards.

So, you’d realize it’s not smart to win now if it means undoing all the progress people have made toward peace and understanding.
