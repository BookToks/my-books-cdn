They are a small and unusual part of the problem.

The main problem comes from people thinking that winning and being the best is the only way to be happy. I agree that feeling successful can make life more enjoyable. For example, a painter who was unknown when young might feel happier if people start to recognize their talent. I also agree that money can make life better up to a certain point, but after that, it doesn’t really add to happiness.

What I believe is that success is just one part of being happy, and it’s not worth it if you lose everything else just to achieve it.

This problem comes from the way people in business think about life. In Europe, there are still other groups that people respect too.
