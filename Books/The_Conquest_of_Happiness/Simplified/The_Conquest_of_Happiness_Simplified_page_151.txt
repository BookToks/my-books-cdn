If his job means he has to live in a small town, especially if he needs to keep the respect of regular people, like a doctor or a lawyer, he might have to hide what he really likes and believes from most people he meets every day. 

This happens a lot in America because the country is so big. In many random places all over the country, there are lonely people who know from books that there are places where they wouldn’t feel so alone, but they can’t live there and only rarely get to talk with people who think like them. 

Real happiness is really hard for these people unless they are very strong and special like Blake or Emily Bronte. To fix this, we need to find a way to make public opinion less powerful or find ways for smart people to meet and enjoy each other’s company.
