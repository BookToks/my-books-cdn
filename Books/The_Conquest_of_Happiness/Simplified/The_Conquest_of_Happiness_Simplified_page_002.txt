This book is not meant for experts or for people who just like to talk about problems without doing anything. You wonâ€™t find any deep philosophy or fancy knowledge here.

I just wanted to share some ideas based on what I think is common sense. The advice I give comes from my own experience and what I have seen, and following it has made me happier.

Because of this, I hope that some of the many people who feel unhappy without enjoying life might understand their situation better and find a way out. I wrote this book because I believe many unhappy people can become happy if they try the right things.
