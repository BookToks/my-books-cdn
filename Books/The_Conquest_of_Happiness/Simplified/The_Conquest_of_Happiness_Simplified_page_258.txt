Different kinds of work can be put in order from less interesting to very interesting. I will start with jobs that are only a little interesting and end with those that can fully engage a great person’s energy.

Two main things make work interesting: first, using skill, and second, building or making something.

Anyone who has learned a special skill likes to use it until it feels easy or until they can’t get any better.

This desire to be active starts when we are kids: a boy who can stand on his head doesn’t want to just stand on his feet anymore. Many jobs give the same kind of fun you get from playing skill games. The work of a lawyer or a politician has even more of this fun, like playing bridge, because it involves not only skill but also beating a smart opponent.
