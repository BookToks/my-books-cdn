Taking care of your nerves hasn’t been studied enough. Industrial psychology has looked into tiredness and showed with numbers that if you keep doing something for a long time, you will get tired — something people could have guessed without all the science.

Most studies about tiredness focus on muscles, and some look at tiredness in school kids. But none of these studies deal with the most important problem.

The main kind of tiredness today is emotional. Pure brain tiredness and muscle tiredness both get better with sleep. For example, if someone does a lot of thinking without any emotions, like doing hard math problems, they will feel better after sleeping at night.
