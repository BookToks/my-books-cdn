Stand on a busy street during work hours, or on a main road on the weekend, or at a dance party in the evening. Clear your mind of your own thoughts, and let the people around you take over your attention one by one. You will see that each group of people has its own problems.

During work hours, you will notice people are worried, very focused, unhappy with their stomachs, not interested in anything except their work, unable to have fun, and unaware of the people around them.

On a main road on the weekend, you will see men and women who have enough money, and some are very rich, all trying to have fun. Everyone moves at the speed of the slowest car in the line. You can’t see the road or the views because looking away might cause a crash. Everyone is focused on trying to pass other cars, but they can’t because there are too many cars. If their mind drifts away from this, especially those not driving, they get really bored and show it on their faces with little signs of unhappiness.
