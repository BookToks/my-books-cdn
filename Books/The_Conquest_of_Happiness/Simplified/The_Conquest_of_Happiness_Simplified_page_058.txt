As people move up in society, they want more and more excitement. Those who have money keep traveling from place to place, always having fun with parties, dancing, and drinking. But somehow, they always think the next place will be even better.

People who have to work get bored sometimes because of their jobs. But rich people, who don’t need to work, want a life with no boredom at all. This is a good goal, and I’m not saying it’s bad. But I think it’s harder to reach than people believe. Mornings can feel boring if the night before was full of fun. 

People get older, and at twenty, we often think life will end at thirty. 

Now that I’m fifty-eight, I don’t think that way anymore. Maybe it’s not smart to waste all your energy too quickly, just like you shouldn’t waste all your money. Maybe having some boredom in life is actually necessary.
