Emotional problems, not the work itself, are what actually cause people to break down.

Worrying is not simple. I have already talked about mental discipline, which means thinking about things at the right time. This is important for three reasons: it helps you get through the day with less mental effort, it can help you sleep better, and it helps you make smarter decisions.

But these methods don’t reach the parts of your mind you are not aware of. When a problem is really serious, no method works well unless it goes deeper than just what you know.

Many psychologists have studied how the unconscious mind affects the conscious mind, but fewer have looked at how the conscious mind affects the unconscious. This is very important for mental health, and we need to understand it if we want our real beliefs to affect what’s going on deep inside our minds.
