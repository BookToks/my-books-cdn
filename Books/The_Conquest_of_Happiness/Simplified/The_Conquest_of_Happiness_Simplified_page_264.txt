Starting an organization can be really important. So is the work of a few leaders who spend their lives turning chaos into order, and Lenin is a great example of this today. Artists and scientists are the most obvious examples of this kind of work.

Shakespeare said about his poems, "As long as people live and can see, these will live on." This idea helped him feel better during hard times. In his sonnets, he says thinking about his friend made life easier for him, but I think the sonnets he wrote were even more helpful than the friend himself.

Great artists and scientists do work that they enjoy. While working, they earn respect from people who matter, giving them a powerful kind of influence over others’ thoughts and feelings. They also have good reasons to feel proud of themselves. You’d think all this would make someone happy. But it doesn’t always.
