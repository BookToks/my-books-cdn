In some types of skilled jobs, like politics, men seem to do their best work between the ages of sixty and seventy. This is because in these jobs, having a lot of experience with other people is very important. That’s why successful politicians are often happier at seventy than most other men their age. The only ones who compete with them in this way are men who lead big companies.

There is another important thing about the best kinds of work that makes people even happier than just using their skills.

This is called constructiveness. In some jobs, but not most, you create something that lasts as a kind of monument when you finish. We can tell the difference between building (construction) and breaking down (destruction) by this idea: in building, things start out messy or random, but end with a clear goal or purpose. In destruction, it’s the opposite: things start with a purpose, but end up messy or random, because the goal is just to ruin or destroy something.
