There shouldn’t be a rule that says every mom has to do everything herself when other women might be better at it. Moms who feel confused or not good enough with their kids shouldn’t be afraid to let trained women help take care of their children.

There isn’t a special instinct that automatically tells moms how to raise their kids. Sometimes being too worried can just be a way of being too controlling. Many kids get hurt emotionally because their moms don’t know how to handle them properly and are too emotional about it.

People have always known that dads can’t do as much for their kids, but kids can still love their dads just as much as their moms. In the future, moms might have to be more like dads in how they relate to their kids. This will help free women from unnecessary hard work and let kids benefit from new scientific knowledge about how to care for their minds and bodies when they are young.
