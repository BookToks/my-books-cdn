People who have lost their natural desire to have children have cut themselves off from the flow of life. Because of this, they risk becoming empty inside. For them, unless they are very detached, death means the end of everything. They donâ€™t care about the world after they are gone, so their actions seem meaningless and unimportant to them.

But for someone who has kids and grandkids and loves them naturally, the future matters a lot, at least for as long as they live. This feeling comes not just from thinking about right and wrong or imagining the future, but from a natural and deep part of themselves.

A person whose interests go beyond just their own life can often reach even further. Like Abraham, they feel happy knowing their family will inherit something good, even if it takes many generations. These feelings help them avoid feeling like life is pointless, which would otherwise make all their emotions feel dead inside.
