I want young people to clearly understand the past and realize that the future will probably be much longer than what has already happened. They should also be very aware of how small our planet is and remember that life here is only temporary.

At the same time, even though these facts make us feel like individuals donâ€™t matter much, I want to show young people something else. I want them to see how amazing each person can be and understand that nothing as valuable as a person is known anywhere in the huge universe.

A long time ago, Spinoza wrote about how people can feel trapped or free. His writing is hard for most people except philosophy students to understand, but what I want to say is very similar to his ideas.
