Maybe the best way to explain the idea I want to share is by telling a bit about my own life. I wasn’t born happy. When I was a kid, my favorite song was: ‘Weary of earth and laden with my sin.’ When I was five, I thought that if I lived to be seventy, I had only lived a small part of my life so far, and the long, boring time ahead felt almost too much to handle.

As a teenager, I hated life and often thought about ending it. But I didn’t because I wanted to learn more math.

Now, things are different. I enjoy life, and I can even say I enjoy it more every year.

This is partly because I figured out what I really wanted and slowly got many of those things. It’s also because I gave up on some goals that I realized were impossible, like trying to know everything for sure.
