These people use others to get what they want and never think about others as important on their own.

Basically, they don’t really care about the people they say they love; they only care about how those people make them feel or help them in some way.

This behavior comes from a problem in their personality, but it’s not easy to figure out or fix. It often happens with people who are very ambitious and only focus on one idea of what makes people happy.

True affection means both people care about each other, not just to benefit themselves, but because they want something good for both. This kind of love is very important for real happiness. A person who keeps their feelings closed off and can’t grow this kind of love misses out on the best parts of life, even if they do well in their job.
