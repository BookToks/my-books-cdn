The most serious kind of tiredness today in rich countries is nervous fatigue. This type of tiredness is strangely more common among rich people, and less common among workers who get paid by the hour than among business people and those who use their brains a lot.

It’s very hard to avoid nervous fatigue in modern life. First, during work hours and even more so when going between work and home, city workers are surrounded by noise. Even though they try not to notice the noise, it still tires them out because their brain is working hard to ignore it without them realizing.

Another cause of tiredness that we don’t notice is being around strangers all the time. People, like other animals, naturally want to check out every new person to decide if they are friendly or not. But people who travel on crowded subways during rush hour have to stop themselves from doing this. This makes them feel a general anger toward all the strangers they have to be close to without choosing to.
