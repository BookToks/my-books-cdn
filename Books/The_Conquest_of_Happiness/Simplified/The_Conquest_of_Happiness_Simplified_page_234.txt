In one situation, a child doesn’t get enough love, and in the other, they get too much attention. In both cases, the child doesn’t experience the simple and natural happiness that a good family can give.

Because of all these problems, is it surprising that fewer babies are being born? The number of babies being born has dropped so much that soon the population might start to shrink. This has already happened in rich families, not just in one country but in many of the most advanced countries.

There aren’t many numbers about birth rates among rich people, but two facts from Jean Ayling’s book can help us understand. Between 1919 and 1922 in Stockholm, professional women had only one-third as many babies as other women. Also, among four thousand graduates from Wellesley College in the U.S. between 1896 and 1913, there were only about three thousand children born. But to keep the population from shrinking, they should have had eight thousand kids, and that’s not even counting children who died young.
