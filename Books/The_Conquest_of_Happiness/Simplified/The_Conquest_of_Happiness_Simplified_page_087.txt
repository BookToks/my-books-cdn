One of the worst parts of nervous tiredness is that it blocks a person from really connecting with the world around them. Things seem dull and quiet to them. They don’t notice people much, except to get annoyed by little habits or actions. They don’t enjoy their food or the sunshine anymore. Instead, they focus too hard on a few things and don’t care about everything else.

Because of this, it’s hard for them to relax, so the tiredness keeps getting worse until they need a doctor’s help. This happens because they have lost the connection with the world, which we talked about before. But how to keep that connection in big, crowded cities is not easy to figure out.

Here, we are touching on big social problems, but I’m not going to talk about those in this book.
