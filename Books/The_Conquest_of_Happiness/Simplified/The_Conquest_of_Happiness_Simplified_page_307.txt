A happy person is someone who doesn’t feel torn inside or fight against the world around them.  

This person feels like they belong everywhere, enjoying everything the world shows and the happiness it gives.  

They aren’t afraid of dying because they feel connected to the people who will come after them.  

When someone feels deeply connected to life like this, they find the greatest happiness.
