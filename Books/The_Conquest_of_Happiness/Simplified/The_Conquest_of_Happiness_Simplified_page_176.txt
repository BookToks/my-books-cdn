I once knew a man who was the best at putting letters together for printing. Many people who loved making artistic letters wanted to work with him. He enjoyed his job, not just because people really respected him, but because he loved doing the work itself. It was kind of like how good dancers enjoy dancing.

I also knew other people who were experts at setting up tricky types of writing, like math symbols, ancient scripts, or other hard alphabets. I didn’t find out if these people were happy outside of work, but when they were working, they loved what they were doing.

People often say that in today’s machine-filled world, craftsmen don’t enjoy their skilled work as much as before. But I’m not sure that’s true. Skilled workers today do different jobs than the old guild workers did, but they are still very important and needed in today’s machine-driven economy.
