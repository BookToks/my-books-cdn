Artists and writers often think it’s normal to be unhappy in their marriages. But scientists often stay happy at home.

This is because their minds are fully focused on their work. They don’t let their thoughts get tangled up in things they don’t need to worry about. They feel happy in their jobs because science is always moving forward and important. Both scientists and regular people agree on this. So, they don’t need complicated feelings. Simple feelings are enough for them.

Complicated feelings are like foam on a river. They happen when something blocks the smooth flow of water. But if energy flows freely, there are no waves or ripples, even if you don’t notice how strong it is.

Scientists have everything they need to be happy in life.
