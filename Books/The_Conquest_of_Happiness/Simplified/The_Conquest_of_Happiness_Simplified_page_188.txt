Some people think it’s silly to enjoy food just because you’re hungry or to enjoy life because it has cool things to see and new experiences. They feel disappointed and look down on people who enjoy simple things.

I don’t agree with this way of thinking. Feeling disappointed like that is a kind of problem. Sometimes it happens because of certain situations, but when it does, we should try to fix it quickly. It’s not some kind of special wisdom.

Imagine one person likes strawberries and another doesn’t. Does that make the person who doesn’t like them better?

There’s no proof that strawberries are good or bad by themselves. To the person who likes them, they taste good; to the person who doesn’t, they don’t. But the person who likes strawberries gets to enjoy something the other doesn’t, so their life is a bit more fun and they’re better at enjoying the world we live in. This idea is true not just for strawberries but for more important things too.
