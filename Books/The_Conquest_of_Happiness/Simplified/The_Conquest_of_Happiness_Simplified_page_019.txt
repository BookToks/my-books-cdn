If he had a way to see what newspapers said about how beautiful his buildings were, how nice his harem was, and how other wise men got upset when arguing with him, could he still say that nothing new ever happens? Maybe these things wouldn’t completely stop him from feeling negative, but he would have to say it in a new way.

One of Mr. Krutch’s complaints about our time is that there are too many new things happening.

If both having no new things or having too many new things is annoying, then neither can really be the real reason for feeling hopeless. Think about the fact that “all the rivers flow into the sea, but the sea never gets full; then the rivers flow back to where they started.” If this makes you feel sad, it means you think traveling is bad. But people actually go to health resorts in the summer to feel better, and then they come back home again.
