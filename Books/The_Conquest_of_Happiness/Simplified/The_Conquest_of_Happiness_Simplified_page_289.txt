People who believe that matter isn’t real might also think that dirt isn’t real, and because of this, they could accidentally put their children in danger.

More generally, you can say that everyone who has normal feelings wants some kind of power. The type of power a person wants depends on what they care about most. Some people want power over what others do, some want power over what others think, and some want power over how others feel. One person might want to change the physical world, while another wants to feel powerful by being smart.

Any kind of public work is about wanting some type of power, unless it’s done just to get rich by cheating. A person who truly feels sad about human suffering will want power to help people. The only person who doesn’t care about power is someone who doesn’t care about other people at all.
