A person who is confused inside looks for excitement and things to distract them. They like strong feelings, not because they make sense, but because they help them forget their problems for a little while. Any strong feeling feels like being drunk to them, and since they can’t imagine true happiness, they think the only way to feel better is by escaping reality.

But this shows there is a deep problem inside. When someone doesn’t have this problem, their greatest happiness comes from using their mind fully. The happiest moments happen when the mind is very active and focused, and when you remember everything clearly.

This is one of the best ways to recognize real happiness. Happiness that needs you to be “drunk” or distracted is fake and doesn’t last. True happiness comes when you fully use your mind and really understand the world around you.
