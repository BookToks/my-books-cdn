Sometimes, a car full of Black people will show real happiness, but their wild behavior makes others angry. This often leads to trouble with the police because of an accident. Having fun during holidays is seen as wrong.

Or, watch people at a fun party. Everyone wants to be happy, but they try hard not to cause problems, like when you try not to freak out at the dentist. People think drinking and touching each other will bring joy, so they get drunk fast and try to ignore how much they don’t like their partners. After drinking enough, some guys start crying and feel bad about themselves, especially about how they treat their moms. Drinking only makes them feel more guilty, feelings their clear thinking usually hides.

The reasons for this sadness come from both society and individual feelings — which are mostly shaped by society itself.
