Part I: Why People Feel Unhappy  
Chapter 1: What Makes People Unhappy?

People feel unhappy for many reasons. Sometimes it's because of things that happen in their life, like problems at school or with friends. Other times, it’s because of how they think about things.  

When people expect too much or compare themselves to others, they often feel worse. Also, if they focus only on what they don’t have, they miss out on what’s good in their life.  

Understanding why we feel unhappy can help us change how we think and feel. This way, we can start to be happier even when things aren’t perfect.
