Now is the time to clearly tell the difference between the two types.

Long ago, people believed that being moderate was very important. But during the time of romanticism and the French Revolution, many stopped believing this. They admired strong feelings, even if those feelings, like in Byron’s stories, were harmful and against society.

However, the old way was better. A good life needs balance between different things, and no one thing should take over so much that it stops you from enjoying others. For example, a person who only loves eating and ignores everything else is called a gormandiser, and this actually makes their life less happy.

Many other strong feelings can also be taken too far. Empress Josephine, for example, was a gormandiser when it came to clothes. At first, Napoleon paid her dressmaker’s bills, but he complained more and more over time.
