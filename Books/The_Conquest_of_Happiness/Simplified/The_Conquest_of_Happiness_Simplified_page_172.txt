This hasn't always been true everywhere. Sometimes, even young and good artists were respected. Julius II, even if he treated Michelangelo badly, still believed Michelangelo could paint well. Today’s rich people might give money to old artists after they can’t work as well, but they don’t think their art is as important as their own money or power. Maybe this is why artists are usually less happy than scientists.

I think the smartest young people in Western countries often feel unhappy because they can’t find jobs that use their best skills. But this isn’t true in Eastern countries. Right now, smart young people in Russia are probably happier than anywhere else.

That’s because they have a new world to build and strong beliefs to help them do it.
