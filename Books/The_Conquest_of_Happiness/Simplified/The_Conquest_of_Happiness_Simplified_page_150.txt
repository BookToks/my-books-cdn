If a young person wants a career that isn’t common in their family or group, people often tell them they are acting too fancy. They say, “What worked for your dad should work for you.” If they question their parents’ religion or politics, they might get into big trouble. Because of this, many talented teens feel really unhappy during their teenage years. While other kids might have fun and enjoy themselves, these teens want something deeper. But they can’t find it with their family or friends where they grew up.

When these young people go to college, they often meet others like them and feel much happier for a few years. If they are lucky, after college they find a job where they can still be around people who understand them. Smart people living in big cities like London or New York can usually find a group of friends where they don’t have to pretend or hide who they are.
