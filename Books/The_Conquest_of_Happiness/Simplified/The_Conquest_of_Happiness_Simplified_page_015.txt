This is what I want to show in this chapter. I want to convince you that, no matter the arguments, reason does not stop people from being happy. In fact, I believe that people who honestly think their sadness comes from their views about the universe are getting things backwards. The truth is they are unhappy for some reason they don’t even realize, and this unhappiness makes them focus on the bad parts of the world around them.

It’s lucky for writers that people don’t read things written a long time ago anymore. If they did, they might think that, no matter what is said about water, making new books is useless. But if we can prove that the ideas in Ecclesiastes are not the only ones a wise person can believe, then we don’t have to worry much about the later thoughts that sound the same.
