No threat, except this one, is strong enough to control something as personal as behavior. When it comes to the government, their argument is way too harsh. People might agree that others should be soldiers, but they don’t want their own kids to be used like that.

So, the government tries to keep poor people uneducated, but, as the numbers show, this doesn’t work well except in the poorest Western countries. Almost no one has kids just because they feel it’s their duty to the public, even if that duty was clearer.

People have children because they think kids will make them happy, or because they don’t know how to stop having them. The second reason is still strong, but it is slowly getting weaker. Nothing the government or churches do can stop this from happening.

Because of this, if white people want to keep surviving, having kids must start making parents happy again.
