Love is the first and most common feeling that helps people work together. People who have felt love strongly won’t agree with the idea that their own happiness is separate from the happiness of the person they love.

Parents’ love is even stronger, but the best kind of parental love comes from the love between the parents. I’m not saying true love happens a lot, but when it does, it shows us important things we wouldn’t understand otherwise. True love is valuable, and no amount of doubt can take that away, even if people who don’t understand love blame their doubt for it.

True love is like a fire that keeps burning in your mind. It never gets tired, never dies, and never cools down. It never turns away from itself.
