Here’s the test: Do you create because you really feel the need to share your ideas or feelings, or do you do it just to get applause? A true artist usually wants applause, but that’s not the main reason they create. They want to make a certain kind of work and hope people like it, but they won’t change how they work just because no one claps.

A person who only wants applause doesn’t have a strong inner push to create a specific kind of art. They could easily make something totally different. If they don’t get applause, they might as well stop trying.

More generally, no matter what you do in life, if other people don’t think you’re as talented as you think you are, don’t be too sure that they’re wrong. If you start believing that everyone is against you and won’t recognize your talents, you might end up feeling really unhappy.
