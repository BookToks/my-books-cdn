The problem is really hard to handle because it is caused by both feeling sorry for someone and not feeling sorry for them. A person who thinks others are always against them will make a sad story seem bigger and more believable. But if people don’t believe their story, they see it as proof that others are mean to them. This problem can be helped by understanding, and the person needs to feel this understanding for it to work.

In this chapter, I want to share some ideas that can help each person notice if they have this kind of thinking. Almost everyone has it a little bit. Once you see it in yourself, you can work on getting rid of it. This is really important for being happy because it’s almost impossible to feel happy if you always think everyone is treating you badly.
