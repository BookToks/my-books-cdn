The choice of words depends on what idea you want to prove. Right now, I’m not trying to prove anything, just explain.

Maybe the easiest way to explain the difference between two types of happiness is to say that one type can be felt by anyone, and the other only by people who can read and write.

When I was a kid, I knew a man who was very happy. His job was digging wells. He was very tall and strong, but he couldn’t read or write. In 1885, when he got a vote for Parliament, he learned for the first time that Parliament even existed.

His happiness didn’t come from ideas or beliefs. He didn’t think about natural laws, improving people, sharing public things, or any religious ideas that smart people usually believe in to enjoy life.

His happiness came from being physically strong, having enough work, and beating challenges like digging through hard rock.  

My gardener’s happiness is like that too. He fights rabbits all the time and talks about them like police talk about criminals. He thinks rabbits are sneaky and dangerous, and believes you have to be just as clever as they are to deal with them.
