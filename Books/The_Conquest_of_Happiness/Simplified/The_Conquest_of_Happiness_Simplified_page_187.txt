There are some people who start eating excitedly but end up thinking the food isn’t cooked well enough. Then, there are those who eat their food quickly and too much, becoming stuffed and noisy. Finally, some people begin hungry, enjoy their food, eat just enough, and then stop.

People also have different attitudes toward the good things life offers. The happy person is like the last type of eater who stops when full. Hunger is to food what excitement is to life. Someone bored with their meals is like a person who feels sad or unhappy. A sick person who eats only because they have to is like someone who lives a strict, simple life. The person who eats too much is like someone who lives only for pleasure. The picky eater is like someone who rejects many of life’s joys because they don’t seem good enough.

Strangely, all these types, except maybe the one who eats too much, look down on the person who just enjoys life in a healthy way and think they are better.
