This meant that the dad went to bed, his wife knitted, and the daughters wished they were dead or far away in Timbuktu. They were not allowed to read or leave the room because the idea was that their dad talked to them at that time, which was supposed to be fun for everyone.

If they were lucky, they got married and had a chance to give their kids a boring childhood just like theirs. If they weren’t lucky, they stayed single and became old maids or faded ladies—an awful fate like something terrible that savage people might do to others.

We need to remember all this boredom when thinking about life a hundred years ago. And if we go even further back, it was even worse. Imagine how boring winter was in a medieval village. People couldn’t read or write, they only had candles for light after dark, and the smoke from their one fire filled the only room that wasn’t freezing cold.

The roads were almost impossible to travel, so you hardly ever saw anyone from another village. It must have been boredom, more than anything else, that caused people to start witch-hunts as the only way to make winter nights less dull.
