Ambition that doesn’t include caring for others usually comes from feeling angry or hating people. This can happen because of unhappiness when you’re young, unfair things that happen later, or other reasons that make someone feel like they are being treated badly. Having a big ego is like being trapped in a prison, and a person needs to break free from it to really enjoy life. Being able to truly care for others shows that someone has escaped this prison of selfishness. Just getting love from others isn’t enough; the love you get should help you give love back. Only when both happen equally does love reach its full potential.

There are many problems, both in our minds and in society, that stop people from sharing love back and forth. This is a serious issue that the world has always faced and still faces today. People are slow to admire others because they worry they might be wrong. They hesitate to show love because they’re afraid of being hurt by the person they care for or judged by others. People are told to be careful, both for moral reasons and to be wise in life, which makes them less willing to be kind and take risks with their feelings.
