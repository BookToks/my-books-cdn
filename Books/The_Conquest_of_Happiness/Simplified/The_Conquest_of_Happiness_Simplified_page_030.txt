It’s not easy to explain quickly why love is important, but I’ll try. First, love is special because it makes us happy all by itself, even though that’s not the only reason it matters.

Oh Love! people are wrong When they say your sweetness is bitter, Because your rich fruit Is the sweetest thing ever.

The person who wrote these lines wasn’t trying to solve big questions about life or God; they were just enjoying love. Love doesn’t just make us happy—it also hurts when it’s not there.

Also, love makes other great things even better, like music, sunrises in the mountains, and the sea under a full moon. If someone has never enjoyed these beautiful moments with someone they love, they haven’t felt how powerful and magical love can be.
