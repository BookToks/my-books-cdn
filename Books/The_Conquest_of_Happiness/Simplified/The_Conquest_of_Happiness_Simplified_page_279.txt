A person who has once understood, even for a little while, what it means to have a great soul canâ€™t be happy if they act small-minded, selfish, or worry about little problems. Someone with a great soul will open their mind wide and let ideas from all over the world in.

They will see themselves, life, and the world as clearly as humans can. They will understand that life is short and small, but also that what matters most is in the minds of people. They will realize that a person who understands the world is, in a way, as great as the world itself. Free from the fears that control someone stuck in bad situations, this person will feel deep happiness. No matter what happens outside, they will stay happy inside.

Now, leaving these big ideas behind and going back to our main topic about the importance of caring about things beyond yourself, there is another reason why this helps us be happier.
