The habits we learn when we are young usually stay with us for life. When people fall in love, they often want a safe place where they can feel admired even when they don’t really deserve it. They want to be praised even if they haven’t done anything special.

For many men, home is a place to escape the truth. Their fears and worries make them like being with someone who makes them feel safe and calm. They want from their wives the same kind of care they once got from a mother who didn’t always act wisely. But then they get upset when their wives treat them like kids.

It’s not easy to explain what the best kind of love is because it usually involves some protection. We don’t ignore when people we love get hurt. But I think worrying about bad things that might happen should not be a big part of love. Being afraid for others is only a little better than being afraid for ourselves. Often, this fear is really just a way to control or own someone.
