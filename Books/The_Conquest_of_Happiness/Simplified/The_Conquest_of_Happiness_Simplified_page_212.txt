In this chapter, I want to talk about a way of thinking that gives us energy and excitement.

Feeling loved by others, not just loving them, makes us feel safe. This feeling is strongest when love goes both ways. It's not just love but also being admired that makes us feel good.

People like actors, preachers, speakers, and politicians need others to admire them. When they get applause and approval, they feel excited about life. When they don’t, they get unhappy and focus too much on themselves. For them, the support of many people is like the strong love that a few close people give to others.

A child whose parents love him accepts this love as normal. He doesn’t think about it much, but it is very important for his happiness. Instead, he thinks about the world, the adventures he has, and the amazing adventures he will have when he grows up.
