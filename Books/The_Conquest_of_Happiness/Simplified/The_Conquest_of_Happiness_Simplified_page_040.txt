It’s impossible to know how long it will take for the poor man to get away from all this. Finally, he falls asleep and feels a little less stressed for a few hours.

His work life is like a short, fast race, but the race he’s running ends at the grave. So, the intense focus he has, which is okay for a quick race, becomes too much over time.

What does he really know about his kids? During the week, he’s at the office, and on Sundays, he’s playing golf. What does he know about his wife? When he leaves in the morning, she’s still sleeping.

In the evenings, both of them are busy with social stuff that stops them from having deep talks.

He probably doesn’t have any close guy friends, though he acts friendly with some people even if he doesn’t really feel it. He knows about spring and harvest only because of how they affect the market. He might have traveled to other countries, but he looked at them with total boredom.
