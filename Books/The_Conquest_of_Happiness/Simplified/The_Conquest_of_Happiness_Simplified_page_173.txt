Old people have been killed, starved, sent away, or removed in other ways so they can't force young people to choose between doing bad things or doing nothing. To a smart Western person, the beliefs of young Russians might seem simple, but really, what's wrong with them? They are building a new world, a world they like, and this new world will probably make most Russians happier than they were before the Revolution. It might not be a place where a smart Western thinker would feel happy, but they don’t have to live there. So, by any practical test, young Russians’ beliefs make sense, and calling them simple only makes sense if you are judging from a theory.

In countries like India, China, and Japan, outside political problems make it hard for young smart people to be happy, but they don’t have the same inside problems as in the West. Young people there have things they care about, and when these things go well, the young people are happy.
