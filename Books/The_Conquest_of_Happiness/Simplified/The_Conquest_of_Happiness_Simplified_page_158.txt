When young people try to control the lives of older people, like complaining when a widowed parent wants to remarry, they are just as wrong as older people who try to control young people’s lives. Both old and young, once they are mature enough, have the right to make their own choices, even if they make mistakes. Young people should not give in to pressure from older people when it comes to important decisions.

For example, imagine you are a young person who wants to become an actor, but your parents don’t agree. They might think acting is wrong or not a good job. They could pressure you a lot, say they will stop supporting you if you don’t listen, warn you that you will regret it later, or tell you scary stories about others who failed after trying acting. 

They might be right that acting is not the best choice for you. Maybe you don’t have the talent or the right voice for it.
