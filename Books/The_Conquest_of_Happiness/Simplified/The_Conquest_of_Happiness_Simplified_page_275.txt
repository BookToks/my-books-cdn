Getting too excited and thinking we're super important isn't a good thing. Sure, it might make us work harder, but it won't make us work better. Doing a little work that has a good goal is better than doing a lot of work that doesn’t lead anywhere, even though some people believe the opposite.

People who really care about their work can sometimes become obsessed. This means they focus on one or two good things and forget everything else. They might think that any harm caused while chasing those things doesn’t matter much. To avoid this kind of obsession, it helps to have a big-picture view of life and our place in the universe. This might sound like a huge idea here, but it’s actually very useful on its own.

One problem with modern higher education is that it mostly teaches specific skills. It doesn’t do enough to help us understand the world and grow our minds and hearts by looking at everything fairly.
