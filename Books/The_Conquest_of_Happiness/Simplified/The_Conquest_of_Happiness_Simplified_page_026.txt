It's interesting how the Victorian age looks very different to young people today compared to how it seemed to those who lived in it. I remember two old ladies I knew when I was young, who each showed different parts of that time.  

One was very strict and serious, and she didn't like that so much poetry was about love. She thought love was a boring topic. The other lady was more relaxed and once said, "No one can blame me, but I think breaking the seventh commandment isn't as bad as breaking the sixth, because at least the seventh needs the other person to agree."  

These ideas are not exactly what Mr. Krutch says about the Victorian era. His ideas come from writers who didnâ€™t really fit in with their time.
