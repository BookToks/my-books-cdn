Because of this, peacocks are calm and peaceful birds. Imagine how unhappy a peacock would be if he was told it’s bad to think highly of himself.

Whenever he saw another peacock showing off his big tail, he would think, “I must not believe my tail is better than his, because that would be being full of myself. But I really wish it was! That annoying bird thinks he’s so amazing! Should I pull out some of his feathers?

Or maybe I could trick him and prove he’s a bad peacock who didn’t act right, and tell the leaders about it. Bit by bit, he would make people believe that peacocks with nice tails are usually bad, and that the smart ruler should choose the shy peacock with just a few messy feathers.
