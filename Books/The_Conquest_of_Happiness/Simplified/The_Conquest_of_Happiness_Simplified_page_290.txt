Wanting some kind of power is a normal part of being the kind of people who can build a good community.

Every time someone wants power, they also have to work hard for it, as long as nothing stops them. People in the West might think this is obvious, but some Westerners like to admire what they call the ‘wisdom of the East’ just when the East is moving away from it. For those people, what we said might seem strange, but that makes it worth saying.

Giving up sometimes is also important for being happy, just like working hard is. A smart person won’t just accept bad things that can be avoided, but they also won’t waste time or energy on problems they can’t change. Even some problems they could avoid, they might accept if fixing them would stop them from reaching something more important.
