Its causes were war, poverty, and violence.

One of Mr. Krutch’s saddest chapters talks about love. It seems that the Victorians cared a lot about love, but today, with our modern ideas, we think differently about it.

For some Victorians who didn’t fully believe in God, love took the place of God. When they felt love, even the most serious people became a bit mystical for a while. They felt something special that made them respect love deeply and feel loyal to it.

For them, love demanded big sacrifices, just like God did. But it also gave meaning to life in a way that nothing else could explain. We are more used to a world without God than they were, but we are not ready for a world without love. Only when we accept that will we understand what it really means to have no belief.
