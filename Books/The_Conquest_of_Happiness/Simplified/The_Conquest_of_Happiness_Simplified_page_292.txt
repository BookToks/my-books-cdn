The man who quits because he has strong hope acts in a very different way. Hope that can’t be beaten must be big and not just about himself.

No matter what I do, I might die or get sick. I might lose to my enemies. I might choose a path that won’t work out. There are many ways personal hopes can fail, but if my personal goals are part of bigger hopes for all people, then failing doesn’t feel as bad.

A scientist who wants to make big discoveries might fail or have to stop because of an injury. But if he really cares about science moving forward, not just his own success, he won’t feel as hopeless as someone who only cares about themselves. A person working for an important change might see their work stopped by a war and realize the change won’t happen in their lifetime.
