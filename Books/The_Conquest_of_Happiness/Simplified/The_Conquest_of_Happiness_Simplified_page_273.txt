People find it hard to care about things that don’t seem useful or important to them. Their goals control what they think about and what they do, so they rarely get really into something that doesn’t have a clear purpose. Of course, there are exceptions, but this is usually how it is.

For example, at a women’s college, the women teachers often talk about work when no men are around. But at a men’s college, the men don’t do this. Women see this as being more dedicated than men, but I don’t think it actually makes their work better. It can also make their thinking more narrow and sometimes even extreme.

Besides helping people relax, interests that aren’t related to work have other benefits.

First, they help people keep things in perspective. It’s easy to get so caught up in our own work and life that we forget how small it is compared to everything else happening in the world. Many things in life don’t depend on what we do at all.
