The little habits that might annoy other people a lot will make him smile and feel calm. He will get things done easily that others might find really hard or impossible. Because he feels happy with who he is, he will be fun to be around, and that will make him even happier. But all of this has to be real; it can’t come from trying to please others just because he feels he has to. Feeling like you have to do something is good for work, but it doesn’t work well in friendships. People want to be liked, not just tolerated. Liking many people naturally and easily is maybe the best way to be happy.

I also talked before about having a friendly interest in things. This might sound strange because you can’t really be friends with things. Still, there is something like friendliness in how a geologist cares about rocks or how an archaeologist cares about old ruins. We should try to have this kind of interest when we think about people or different societies.
