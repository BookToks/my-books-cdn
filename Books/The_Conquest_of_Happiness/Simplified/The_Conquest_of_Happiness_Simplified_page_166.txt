Until now, we have been talking about unhappy people. Now, it’s time to think about happy people. From talking with some friends and reading their books, I almost started to believe that being happy today is impossible. But when I think about it more, travel to other countries, and talk with my gardener, I realize that this isn’t true.

I talked about why some of my writer friends are unhappy in an earlier part. Now, I want to look at the happy people I have met in my life.

There are two main kinds of happiness, though there are many levels in between. These two kinds can be called simple and fancy, animal and spiritual, or happiness of the heart and happiness of the mind.
