But being brave about doing the right thing and having the courage to think for yourself haven’t been studied much. Still, they have their own ways to get better at them. Every day, be honest with yourself about at least one hard truth; this will help you as much as doing a good deed every day helps a Boy Scout. Teach yourself to believe that life is still worth living even if you aren’t, like you probably think you are, way better than your friends in being good or smart. Doing this kind of practice for a few years will help you face facts without being scared, and it will free you from a lot of fear.

What you end up caring about after you stop being so focused on yourself depends on who you are and what happens around you. Don’t tell yourself ahead of time, “I’d be happy if I got really into stamp collecting,” and then start collecting stamps, because you might just find that stamp collecting isn’t interesting to you at all.
