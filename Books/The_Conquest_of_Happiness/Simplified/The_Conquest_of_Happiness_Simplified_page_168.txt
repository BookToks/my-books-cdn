Like the heroes of Valhalla who hunted a wild boar every day, killing it each evening but watching it come back to life each morning, my gardener can fight his enemy one day without worrying that the enemy will be gone the next day. Even though he is over seventy, he works all day and rides his bike sixteen miles on hilly roads to and from work. His happiness never runs out, and it comes from ‘those rabbits.’

But you might say, these simple pleasures aren’t for smart people like us. How can we enjoy fighting such small creatures like rabbits? I think that’s a weak argument. A rabbit is much bigger than a tiny germ that causes yellow fever, and yet smart people can still find joy in fighting those germs.
