Having a job makes holidays feel even better when they come.

If a person doesn’t have to work too hard and get too tired, they will enjoy their free time much more than someone who does nothing at all.

Another good thing about most paid jobs and some unpaid ones is that they give chances to succeed and dream big. In most jobs, success is shown by how much money you make, and as long as our society keeps working this way, that will stay true. Only the very best jobs don’t use money as the main way to measure success.

People want to earn more money not just for things, but also because it shows they are successful. Even boring jobs feel okay if they help build a good reputation, either with many people or just with friends and family.

Having a clear goal to work toward is very important for being happy over time, and for most people, this comes mainly from their work.
