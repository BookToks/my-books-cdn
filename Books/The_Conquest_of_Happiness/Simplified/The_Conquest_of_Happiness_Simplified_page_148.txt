People can hardly believe that in some places or groups, ideas they are too scared to share because others might think they're really strange would actually be seen as normal and everyday.

Because they don’t understand the world well, a lot of unnecessary sadness happens. Sometimes this only happens when they’re young, but often it lasts their whole life.

Blake, like Emily Bronte, was very mentally alone, but both were great enough to rise above it because they always believed they were right and their critics were wrong.
