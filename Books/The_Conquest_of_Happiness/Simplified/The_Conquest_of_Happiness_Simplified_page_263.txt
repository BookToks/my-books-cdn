Maybe it’s better to say that people who like building things get more happiness from it than people who like breaking things get from destruction. If you’re full of hate, it’s hard to enjoy building like someone without hate would.

The joy you get from succeeding in a big project is one of the best feelings in life. But, sadly, only very talented people usually get to experience it at the highest level. Nothing can take away the happiness of finishing important work successfully—unless it turns out your work was actually bad. There are many ways to feel this kind of happiness. For example, a person who makes dry land bloom by creating an irrigation system feels this joy in a clear and real way.
