If you asked journalists in England or America if they believed in the ideas of the newspaper they worked for, most would say no. Only a few actually believe in it. The others just do the job to earn money, even if they think it’s harmful.  

This kind of work doesn’t make them feel really happy. To deal with doing it, they become so cynical that they stop enjoying anything fully.  

I don’t blame people who do this kind of work because starving is a serious problem. But if someone can find a job that makes them feel good inside and still pays enough to live, it’s better for their happiness to choose that job instead of a higher-paying one they don’t believe in.  

Without respect for yourself, real happiness is almost impossible.
