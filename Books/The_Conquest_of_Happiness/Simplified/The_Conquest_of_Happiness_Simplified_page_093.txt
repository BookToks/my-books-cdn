What can cure envy? For really good people, being selfless can help, but even saints can feel jealous of other saints sometimes. I don’t think St Simeon Stylites would have been totally happy if he heard about another saint who stood longer on a smaller pillar than he did.

But for normal people, the only way to stop feeling envy is to be happy. The problem is, envy makes it really hard to be happy. I think envy often starts because of bad things that happen during childhood. A kid who sees a brother or sister getting more attention might start feeling jealous. Later, when they grow up, they look for unfair things happening to them, notice them if they happen, and even imagine them if they don’t.

This kind of person usually ends up unhappy and annoying to friends, who can’t always remember to avoid hurting their feelings. If someone starts by thinking no one likes them, they often act in ways that make that true. Another bad thing that can cause envy is having parents who don’t show much love or care.
