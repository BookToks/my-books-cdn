The Greek idea of moderation works well in these situations.

A person who likes chess enough to look forward to playing it after work is lucky. But someone who stops working just to play chess all day has lost the balance of moderation. 

It is said that when Tolstoy was younger, he got a military medal for bravery. But when it was time to receive it, he was so focused on a chess game that he didn’t go. We can’t really blame Tolstoy for this because he might not have cared much about medals. But for most people, this would have been a silly choice.

As a limit to this idea, we should admit that some actions are so important and noble that it’s okay to give up everything else for them.
