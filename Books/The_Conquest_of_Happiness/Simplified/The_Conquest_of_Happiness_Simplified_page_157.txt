There is no good reason to believe this idea. It’s like the saying “murder will out.” We know about some murders, but there might be many we never hear about.  

In the same way, all the geniuses we know of have overcome hard times, but that doesn’t mean there weren’t many others who gave up when they were young.  

It’s not just about genius either; talent is important too, and that helps everyone. It’s also not just about making it through, but doing so without feeling bitter or losing energy. Because of this, life should not be too hard for young people.  

Older people should respect what young people want, but young people don’t have to always respect what older people want. The reason is simple: it’s the young people’s lives that matter most, not the older people’s.
