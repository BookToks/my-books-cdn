If American businesspeople want to be happier, they need to change what they believe in. Right now, many believe it’s their duty to always chase success. They think anyone who doesn’t try hard to succeed is weak. Because of this, their lives are too focused and stressful to enjoy happiness.

This often leads to losing money and feeling worried all the time. For me, what I want from money is free time and security. But most people want money to show off, live in luxury, and be better than others. In America, the social status is always changing and not very clear.
