People hope that by making others scared, they can control them better. This is one reason why men have liked shy women, because by protecting them, they felt like they owned them. How much care someone can handle without getting hurt depends on their personality: strong and brave people can take a lot, but shy people should not expect too much.

Love and care have two main jobs. So far, we talked about how they make us feel safe, but as adults, they are even more important for having kids.

Not being able to make someone feel romantic love is a big problem for anyone because it takes away one of the greatest joys in life.

This lack of love usually makes people lose their energy and become withdrawn. Often, problems from childhood cause personality issues that make it hard to find love later on.
