Imagine you give a speech at a public dinner. Pictures of some other speakers show up in the newspapers, but there is no picture of you. Why is that?

It’s not because the other speakers are more important. It must be because the newspaper editors decided to ignore you. But why would they do that? Probably because they were afraid of how important you are. So, not having your picture actually becomes a kind of hidden compliment.

But tricking yourself like this won’t make you truly happy. Deep down, you’ll know the real reason. To hide this from yourself, you might start making up strange ideas. Trying to believe these ideas will become really stressful.

Also, these ideas mean you think a lot of people don’t like you. This might help your self-esteem a little, but it will mostly make you feel lonely and like you don’t fit in with the world.
