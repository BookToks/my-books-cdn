In all these different situations, the person who loves life has an advantage over someone who doesn’t. Even bad experiences can be useful to them. I’m glad I have smelled a Chinese crowd and visited a Sicilian village, even though I didn’t really enjoy it at the time.

Adventurous people enjoy things like shipwrecks, mutinies, earthquakes, fires, and other tough experiences, as long as these don’t hurt their health. For example, during an earthquake, they think, “So this is what an earthquake feels like,” and they are happy to learn something new about the world.

It’s not true to say these people are safe from bad luck, because if they lose their health, they might also lose their love for life. But this doesn’t always happen.
