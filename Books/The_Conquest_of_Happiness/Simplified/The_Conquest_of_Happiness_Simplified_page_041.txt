He thinks books are useless and music is for smart people. Each year, he feels more alone; he focuses more on work and has less fun outside of it. I have seen Americans like him in their middle age when they visit Europe with their wives and daughters.

Apparently, they convinced him to take a vacation and let his girls see the Old World. The mother and daughters are very excited and show him all the interesting things they notice. The dad, completely tired and bored, wonders what is happening at his office or in the baseball world.

In the end, the women give up on him and think men don’t understand culture. They don’t realize that he is stuck because of their demands. But that’s not the whole truth, just like the old practice of suttee wasn’t what it seemed to outsiders. Often, the widow agreed to be burned because of honor and religion. The businessman’s religion is making a lot of money, so he accepts his suffering just like the widow did.
