If a child doesn’t have a brother or sister who gets special treatment, they might think that kids in other families are loved more by their parents. This can make the child hate those other kids and even their own parents. When they grow up, they might feel like they don’t belong, like Ishmael from a story. Some kinds of happiness should be for everyone, and if you don’t get them, it can make you feel sad and angry inside.

But someone who feels jealous might say, "Why tell me that happiness will stop my envy? I can’t be happy as long as I feel jealous, and you say I can’t stop being jealous until I’m happy." Real life doesn’t work like that. Just understanding why you feel jealous is a big step toward fixing it. Always comparing yourself to others is a bad habit. When something good happens, you should enjoy it fully without thinking it’s not as good as what someone else might have.
