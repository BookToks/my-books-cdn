People in modern society often feel less excited about life because they have to follow rules that limit their freedom, which is part of how our society works. 

A savage hunts when he is hungry because he feels a direct need. A man who goes to work every morning does it for the same basic reason: to earn money for food. But he doesn’t feel hungry when he leaves for work because he just ate. He knows he will be hungry later, so he works now to prepare for that future hunger. 

For savages, actions happen when they feel an impulse, but in modern life, habits have to be regular and planned. 

In savage groups, even group activities happen naturally and suddenly. 

When a tribe goes to war, drums make everyone excited and ready to fight. But modern jobs can’t be run by feelings like that.
