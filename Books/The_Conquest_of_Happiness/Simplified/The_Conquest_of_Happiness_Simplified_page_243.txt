In all relationships between people, it’s pretty easy to make one person happy, but it’s much harder to make both people happy. The prison guard might like watching over the prisoner; the boss might like bossing around the worker; the ruler might like controlling people strictly; and old-fashioned dads probably liked teaching their kids right by using punishment. 

But these are one-sided pleasures. The other person usually doesn’t enjoy it. We now feel that these one-sided kinds of happiness aren’t really good. We think a good relationship should make both people feel good.

This is especially true for parents and children. Because of this, parents get less happiness from their kids than they did before, and kids don’t suffer as much from their parents like they used to a long time ago. I don’t think parents have to be less happy with their kids than before, but right now, that’s how it is.
