More and more, people can choose their friends because they like them, not just because they are nearby. Being around people who share your interests and opinions helps you feel happier.

Talking and spending time with others will probably happen more and more this way. This could help reduce the loneliness that many people who don’t fit in feel. This will make them happier, but it will also mean that the usual people won’t get the same enjoyment from having control over those who are different. I don’t think we need to worry about losing that kind of enjoyment.

Being scared of what others think, like any fear, holds you back and stops you from growing. It’s hard to be great if you’re always afraid of others’ opinions. True happiness comes from being free inside, and to be free, you have to live in a way that comes from your own feelings, not from what your neighbors or family want.
