They feel like they have an important role in their country and want to achieve goals that are hard but possible.

Young people in the West who are very educated often feel cynical. This happens because they are comfortable but also feel powerless. Feeling powerless makes them think nothing is worth doing, and being comfortable helps them handle that feeling.

In the East, university students can have more influence on what people think than students in the West. But they usually donâ€™t have as many chances to make good money. Since they are not powerless or comfortable, they often become reformers or revolutionaries instead of cynics.

The happiness of reformers or revolutionaries depends on what happens in their country. Still, even if they face punishment or danger, they probably feel more real happiness than the comfortable cynics do. I remember a young Chinese visitor to my school who was going back home to start a similar school in a strict part of China.
