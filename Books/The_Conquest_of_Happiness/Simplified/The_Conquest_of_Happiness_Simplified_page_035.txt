I want to talk about Ernst Toller’s play called Massemensch as an example of what I mean. I’m not saying it’s as good as the best works from great times in the past, but I do think it’s fair to compare them. It’s serious, deep, and real, dealing with brave actions and making the reader feel strong emotions like pity and fear, just like Aristotle said tragedy should do.

There aren’t many examples of this new kind of tragedy yet because old ways and traditions have to be left behind. But they can’t be replaced by just smart but boring ideas. To write a tragedy, a person has to truly feel tragedy. To feel tragedy, a person has to understand the world they live in, not just with their mind but with their whole body and feelings.

Mr. Krutch talks a lot about despair in his book, and it’s moving how he accepts a hard and sad world. But this sadness comes from the fact that he and many writers haven’t learned to feel old emotions in new ways. The reasons to feel those emotions are there, but not in the groups of writers and artists.
