People who teach about right and wrong in Western countries try to solve this problem by giving advice and using feelings. They say that every married couple must have as many kids as God wants, no matter if those kids will be healthy or happy. At the same time, some men in charge talk about how wonderful motherhood is and act like having many sick and poor children is something to be happy about.

The government also joins in, saying we need enough people to fight in wars, because all the powerful weapons need people to use them on.

But strangely, even if parents believe these ideas about others, they ignore them when it comes to themselves.

The problem is how these leaders and patriots think. The religious leaders might succeed as long as people fear going to hell, but now only a few people really believe in that threat.
