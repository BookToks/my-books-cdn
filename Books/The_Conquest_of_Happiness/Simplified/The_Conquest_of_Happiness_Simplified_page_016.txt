When we talk about feelings, we need to separate the mood itself from the way we think about it.

You can't argue with a mood. It might change because something lucky happens or because your body feels different, but talking won't change it. I've often felt like everything is pointless, but I didn’t get out of that feeling by thinking harder—I got out of it because I had to take action.

If your child is sick, you might be sad, but you won’t think everything is pointless. You’ll want to help your child get better no matter what you believe about life’s meaning. A rich person might feel like everything is pointless, but if they lose all their money, they’ll care a lot about having food to eat.

This feeling comes from having all your needs easily met. Humans, like animals, are used to working hard to survive. When someone is very rich and can get whatever they want without trying, not having to work takes away something important for feeling happy.
