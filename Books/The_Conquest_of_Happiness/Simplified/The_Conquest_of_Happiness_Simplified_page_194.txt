I have seen men die after many years of slow suffering, but they kept their excitement for life almost until the very end. Some kinds of sickness destroy this excitement, while others don’t. I don’t know if scientists can tell the difference yet. Maybe in the future, science will help us take pills that keep us interested in everything. But until then, we have to use common sense to understand why some people stay interested in life while others don’t.

Sometimes, excitement for life is about everything, and sometimes it’s about just one thing.

It can even be very focused. People who read Borrow might remember a character from Romany Rye. He lost his wife, whom he loved a lot, and felt like life had no meaning. But then he got interested in Chinese writing on teapots and tea-chests. He even learned French to help him understand a Chinese grammar book. Slowly, he figured out the writing and found a new reason to enjoy life, even though he never used his Chinese knowledge for anything else.
