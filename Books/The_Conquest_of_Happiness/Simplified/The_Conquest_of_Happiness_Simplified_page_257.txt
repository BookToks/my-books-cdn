Women who spend their time doing housework have it harder than men or women who work outside the home. A wife who stays at home doesn’t get paid, can’t easily improve her skills, and her husband often doesn’t notice what she does. He values her for other reasons, not for the housework she does. 

This isn't true for women who are rich enough to have beautiful homes and gardens that others admire. But most women doing housework don’t get as much happiness from it as men or women with jobs outside the home do.

Having a job helps most people pass the time and gives them a chance to use their talents, even if the work is boring. This is why men with dull jobs are usually happier than men with no job at all. 

But when work is interesting, it can make people feel much happier than just escaping boredom.
