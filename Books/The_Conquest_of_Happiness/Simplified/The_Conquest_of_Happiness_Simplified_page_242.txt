If it weren’t for this special feeling, there wouldn’t be much point in having families, because kids could be taken care of by professionals just as well.

But the special love that parents have for their kids, as long as their natural feelings are still there, is important for both the parents and the children. This love is valuable because it is more trustworthy than any other kind of love.

Friends like you for your good qualities, and people you like might like you for how you look or act. If those things change, friends and lovers might disappear. But parents are the ones you can count on the most during hard times, like when you’re sick or going through bad situations, as long as the parents care the right way.

We all feel happy when people admire us for what we do well, but deep down, most of us know that kind of admiration can go away. Parents love us simply because we are their children, and that can’t change. This makes us feel safer with them than with anyone else. When things are going well, this might not seem very important, but when things go wrong, it gives us comfort and security that we can’t find anywhere else.
