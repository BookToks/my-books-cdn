A savage might cheat on a woman while her husband is sleeping right next to her, knowing that if the husband wakes up, it means instant death. I guess that situation isn’t boring at all.

But when farming started, life became more boring, except for rich people, who still lived like hunters. People often complain about how boring it is to work with machines, but I think old-style farming was just as boring. In fact, I believe machines have made life less boring overall. Workers don’t have to work alone all day, and in the evenings, they can enjoy different fun activities that weren’t possible in small country villages long ago.

Think about how life changed for the lower middle class. In the past, after dinner, when the wife and daughters cleaned up, everyone would sit together and have what they called a ‘happy family time.’
