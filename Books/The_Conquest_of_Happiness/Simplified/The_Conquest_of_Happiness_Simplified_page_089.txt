Envy is the main reason behind democracy. Heraclitus said that all the people of Ephesus should be hanged because they said, "there shall be none first among us." The push for democracy in Greek States was mostly driven by this feeling. The same is true for modern democracy.

There is a nice idea that democracy is the best way to run a country. I also think this idea is true.

But in real politics, good ideas don’t usually cause big changes. When big changes happen, the reasons people give are often just covers for their feelings. And the feeling that really pushes democracy is envy. 

If you read the memoirs of Madame Roland, who is often seen as a kind woman who cared about the people, you’ll see that what made her a strong supporter of democracy was the time she was shown into the servants’ hall when she visited a rich noble’s house.
