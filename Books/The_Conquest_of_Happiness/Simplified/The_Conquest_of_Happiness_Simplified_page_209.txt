Chapter 12: Affection

One big reason people lose their enthusiasm is feeling like no one loves them. On the other hand, feeling loved makes people excited and happy more than anything else.

A person might feel unloved for different reasons. Maybe they think they are so bad that no one could love them. Or maybe when they were a kid, they didn’t get as much love as other kids. Or it could be true that no one loves them right now. But if that’s the case, it’s probably because they don’t believe in themselves because of bad things that happened early in life.

When someone feels unloved, they might act in different ways. They might try really hard to get love by being extra nice. But this usually doesn’t work because people can tell when someone is being kind just to get something. Also, people tend to give love more easily to those who don’t seem to need it so much. So, the person who tries to buy love by doing good things often ends up feeling sad because people don’t appreciate it.
