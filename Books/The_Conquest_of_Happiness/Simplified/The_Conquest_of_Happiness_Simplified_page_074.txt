A lot of tiredness comes from worrying, and worrying can be stopped by having a better way of thinking about life and some mental control. Most people aren’t good at controlling their thoughts. This means they can’t stop thinking about problems when there’s nothing they can do about them.

People often take their work worries to bed. At night, when they should be resting to get ready for the next day, they keep thinking about problems they can’t fix right now. They don’t think in a helpful way but in a stressed and confused way that happens when someone can’t sleep. This tired, worried feeling stays in the morning, making it hard to think clearly, stay calm, and deal with problems.

Smart people only think about their problems when it will help them. At other times, they think about different things or, if it’s night, they try not to think at all.
