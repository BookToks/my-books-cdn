The big goal of machines is to do all the boring and repetitive jobs, so people can focus on work that is interesting and creative. Right now, we’re not there yet, but one day, work will be less dull and sad than it has been since farming started. 

A long time ago, when people hunted for food, work was fun. You can see this because rich people still hunt for fun today. But when farming began, people had to deal with lots of boring and hard work to avoid starving.

Now, machines are helping to free people from that tough life. Some people like to talk about the good things about farming and the wisdom of farmers, but most young people in the countryside just want to move to towns. They want jobs in factories or places like cinemas, where they don’t have to suffer in bad weather or feel lonely during long, dark winters.
