Wanting power is sneaky; it can hide in many ways, and it often makes us feel good when we think we are helping others. 

Sometimes, helping people means stopping them from enjoying things like drinking, gambling, or being lazy. 

This can come from feeling jealous of people who do things we can’t do if we want others to respect us. 

For example, people who vote for laws against smoking usually don’t smoke themselves. They feel bad when others enjoy tobacco. 

If they expect smokers to thank them for stopping this bad habit, they might be surprised when they don’t. 

Then, they might think they worked hard for the good of everyone, but the people who should be thankful don’t seem to care at all.
