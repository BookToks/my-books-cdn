This is especially true when it comes to worrying. It’s easy to tell yourself that a bad thing wouldn’t be so terrible if it actually happened. But as long as you only think this during the day, it won’t stop you from feeling scared at night or having bad dreams.

I believe that if you focus on a thought with enough energy and intensity, you can plant it into your unconscious mind. Most of what’s in the unconscious used to be strong feelings and thoughts we had when we were awake, but now they’re hidden deep inside.

You can actually do this on purpose, and by doing that, your unconscious mind can help you a lot. For example, when I have to write about something really hard, I think about it very hard for a few hours or days. Then, I tell myself to keep working on it quietly in the background.

After a few months, I come back to the topic and find that the work is already done.
