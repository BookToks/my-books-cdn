His way of thinking about what other people think is shown in these lines: Not many people have strong feelings inside themselves. Most people need friendly people around them to be happy.

For most people, the place they live in is friendly. They learn the common ideas when they are young and naturally follow the beliefs and habits they see around them.

If he wants to read serious books, other kids make fun of him, and teachers say those books are troubling. If he likes art, other kids think he’s weird, and adults think it’s wrong.
