Many times, being too scared makes problems worse than they need to be. People are usually meaner to those who clearly fear them than to those who don’t care about what others think.

It’s like a dog that barks louder and bites more when people are afraid of it, but ignores people who don’t care. People act in a similar way. If you show you’re scared of them, they see you as an easy target. But if you don’t care, they start to doubt themselves and leave you alone.

I’m not talking about being extremely bold. If you have strong beliefs that don’t fit in with the place you’re in, like in Kensington or Russia, then you have to deal with the consequences.

I mean smaller things, like not dressing the way people expect, not going to a certain church, or reading smart books that others don’t like.
