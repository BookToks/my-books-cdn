Most guys, after they stop believing the old superstitions from when they were kids, think they’re done with that stuff. They don’t realize those superstitions are still hiding deep inside them.

When someone has figured out what makes sense to them, they need to think about it more, follow what it means, and look inside themselves for any old beliefs that don’t match up with their new ideas. If they start feeling guilty, which can happen sometimes, they shouldn’t see that guilt as a sign to be better or more spiritual. Instead, they should see it as a problem or weakness, unless they did something that a fair sense of right and wrong would say is wrong. I’m not saying people shouldn’t have morals, just that they shouldn’t have superstitious morals, because those are very different.

Even when a person breaks their own logical rules, I don’t think feeling guilty is the best way to get better.

Feeling guilty can make someone feel low and like they don’t respect themselves.
