But the feeling of sin, in its most important ways, goes much deeper. It comes from the unconscious part of the mind and doesn’t show up as just being afraid of what other people think. In our minds, some actions are called Sin for no clear reason we can understand. When someone does these things, they feel uneasy but don’t really know why.

They wish they were the kind of person who could avoid what they believe is sin. They admire people who seem pure and good inside. They feel a little sad or sorry that they can’t be a saint. In fact, their idea of a saint is probably something almost impossible to live like in everyday life. So, they live with guilt, thinking the best things aren’t meant for them, and their best moments are when they feel sorry for themselves.

Almost always, this all starts because of the moral lessons they got before they were six years old, from their mom or nurse.
