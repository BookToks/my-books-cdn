A man who feels bad about his work usually canâ€™t feel good about himself.

Doing something useful and creative at work might only be possible for some people, but it can still be possible for a lot of people. Anyone who is in control of their work or who thinks their work is helpful and needs skill can feel proud. Raising good children is a hard and important job that can make a woman feel deeply satisfied. If a woman has done this, she can feel that she has added something valuable to the world.

People are very different in how they see their lives as a whole. Some people naturally think about their life as one big story, and this helps them be happy. Others see life as just random events with no clear path or meaning. I believe the first group is more likely to be happy because they build a life that gives them pride and joy. The second group might feel lost and moved around by whatever happens, never finding a place where they feel safe or happy.
