Many active people think that even a little bit of giving up or joking around would ruin the energy and determination they need to succeed. I believe these people are wrong.

Good work can be done by people who are honest about how important the work is and how hard it really is. People who can only work if they lie to themselves should learn to accept the truth first before they keep going. If they don’t, their work might end up causing more harm than good.

It’s better to do nothing than to cause harm. A lot of useful work is spent fixing the damage caused by harmful work. Spending some time learning to understand facts isn’t wasted time, and the work done after that is less likely to be harmful than work done by people who need to keep boosting their ego to stay motivated.

Accepting the truth about ourselves means a kind of giving up, but though it might hurt at first, it protects us from the disappointments and letdowns that people who lie to themselves often face.
