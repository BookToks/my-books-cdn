A person like that, if they had gotten more love, would be less scared of the real world and wouldn’t need to make up a perfect imaginary world to believe in.

But not all love helps people become brave and try new things. The love needs to be strong and encouraging, wanting the person to do their best, even if it’s a little risky, while still caring about their safety. 

A scared or overprotective mom or nurse who always warns kids about dangers, thinking every dog will bite or every cow is dangerous, can make kids just as scared as she is. This can make them feel safe only when they are close to her. 

Sometimes, a mom who wants to keep her child close might like this because she wants the child to depend on her instead of learning to handle the world. In the end, this kind of love might actually hurt the child more than if they weren’t loved at all.
