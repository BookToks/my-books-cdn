For me personally, being a parent has made me happier than anything else in my life. I think when people decide not to have kids, they miss out on a deep kind of happiness. This can make them feel unhappy and bored without knowing why.

To really be happy, especially after you’re no longer young, you need to feel like you’re part of something bigger than just yourself. You have to know that life goes on, from the very beginning to the far future.

This idea might sound fancy or complicated, but really it’s a simple feeling inside us. It’s natural, and not having it is what feels strange or unusual. Some people can feel this by doing amazing things that last a long time, but most people can only feel this by having children.
