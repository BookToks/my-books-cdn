A guy who likes watching football is better off than a guy who doesn’t. A guy who likes reading is even better off than the one who doesn’t like football, because there are more chances to read than to watch football.

The more things a person enjoys, the more chances they have to be happy. They don’t have to depend on just one thing. If they lose one interest, they can enjoy another. Life is short, so we can’t be interested in everything, but it’s good to like enough things to keep us busy.

Sometimes people turn inward and focus only on themselves, even though there’s a huge, amazing world around them. But being unhappy and closed off like that isn’t something to admire.

Once, there were two sausage machines made to turn pigs into tasty sausages. One machine loved working with pigs and made tons of sausages. The other said, “What does pig have to do with me?”
