In some groups, people really like art, but in others, especially if it's modern art, they think it’s bad or even evil. In some groups, loving the Empire is the most important thing, but in others, it’s seen as a bad habit or even something silly. Regular people think cheating on your partner is one of the worst things you can do, but many people think it’s okay or even good. Catholics don’t allow divorce at all, but most non-Catholics think divorce is sometimes necessary.

Because of all these different views, a person with certain tastes and beliefs might feel like an outsider in one group, but be normal and accepted in another. A lot of unhappiness, especially for young people, comes from this. A young man or woman might pick up new ideas around them but find out that these ideas are totally rejected where they live. Young people often feel like their small world is all there is in the entire world.
