When talking about this problem, I will focus on people who don’t have really bad things happening in their lives. I will assume they have enough money for food and a place to live, and enough health to do normal daily activities. I won’t talk about huge disasters like losing all your children or being publicly embarrassed. Those things are important, but they are different from what I want to discuss.

My goal is to suggest a way to fix the usual unhappiness that most people in developed countries feel every day. This unhappiness is worse because there’s no clear reason for it, so it feels like it can’t be avoided. I think this unhappiness mostly comes from wrong ideas about the world, wrong morals, and bad habits. These things destroy the natural excitement and interest in life that all happiness depends on, whether for people or animals.

These problems can be changed by the person themselves. I want to suggest changes that can help someone be happy, as long as they have average good luck in life.
