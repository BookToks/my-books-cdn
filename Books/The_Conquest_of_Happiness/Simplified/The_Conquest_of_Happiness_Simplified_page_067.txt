When fun things end, they often leave you feeling empty and not really happy, like you want something but don’t know what it is. These kinds of fun don’t bring real joy.

But other kinds of happiness come from being connected to nature and the world around us. These feelings are deeply satisfying, and even after they end, the good feeling stays with you. They might not be as exciting, but they last longer.

The kind of happiness I’m talking about can come from simple or fancy activities. For example, a little two-year-old boy shows a very basic way of being connected to the Earth. On a higher level, you can see this same feeling in poetry. Shakespeare’s poems are so great because they are full of the same joy that made the little boy hug the grass.

Take poems like ‘Hark, hark, the lark’ or ‘Come unto these yellow sands.’ These poems express the same feeling in a more grown-up way that the two-year-old could only show by crying out.
