Michelangelo, for example, was a very unhappy man. He said (which I don’t think is true) that he wouldn’t have made art if he didn’t have to pay off his poor family’s debts. Often, but not always, being able to make great art comes with deep unhappiness. Without the happiness the artist gets from creating, they might even think about ending their life. So, we can’t say that great art always makes a person happy. We can only say it makes them less unhappy.

Scientists, on the other hand, are usually less unhappy than artists. Most scientists who do amazing work are happy people, and their happiness mainly comes from their work.

Today, many smart people, especially writers, are unhappy because they don’t get to use their talents freely. Instead, they have to work for rich companies run by people who don’t care about art or ideas. These bosses often make them create things that the writers think are nonsense.
