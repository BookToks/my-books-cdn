You can be interested in things even if you don’t like them. For example, a person might learn about where spiders live because they hate spiders and want to stay away from them. This kind of interest doesn’t feel as good as the happiness a geologist feels when studying rocks.  

Being interested in things that don’t involve people might not make you as happy as being kind to others, but it is still really important. The world is huge, and we can’t control everything. If we only feel happy because of what happens to us personally, we might expect too much from life.  

Expecting too much can actually make us feel worse. A person who can forget their problems by learning about something like the Council of Trent or how stars live will feel calm and steady when they come back to their problems. While they are learning, they also get a real, even if short, feeling of happiness.
