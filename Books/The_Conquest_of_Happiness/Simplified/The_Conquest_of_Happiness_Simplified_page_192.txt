People have very different ways of thinking about other people.

Some guys, on a long train ride, don’t notice anyone else at all. But others notice everyone, figure out what kind of people they are, guess their life stories, and maybe even learn some secrets about them. People also feel differently about others. Some find most people boring, while others quickly make friends unless there’s a clear reason not to.

Think about traveling: some people visit many countries but always stay in fancy hotels, eat the same food they eat at home, hang out with rich people like the ones they know, and talk about the same stuff they talk about at home. When they get back, they’re just glad the trip is over. Other people, wherever they go, notice what makes the place special, meet locals, learn about the history and culture, try the local food, and even pick up the language. They come home with lots of new and interesting stories to think about.
