The family is based on the fact that parents have a special kind of love for their own children. This love is different from how they feel about each other or other kids.

Some parents don’t feel much love for their children, and some women can feel almost the same love for kids who aren’t theirs. But in general, parents usually have a unique feeling for their own kids, not for other people’s kids.

This feeling comes from our animal ancestors. Freud didn’t think enough about biology because if you watch an animal mother with her babies, you’ll see she acts very differently toward them than toward the male she mates with.

Humans also have this different and natural way of feeling, but it’s less obvious and not as strong.
