There are people who make scientific tools and delicate machines. There are designers, airplane mechanics, drivers, and many others who have jobs where they can get really skilled.

Farm workers and peasants in simple communities don’t seem as happy as drivers or engine operators. The peasant who works his own land does different tasks like plowing, planting, and harvesting. But he depends a lot on the weather and feels he has little control.

On the other hand, a person who works with modern machines feels powerful and like they control nature, not the other way around. It’s true that many machine operators do boring, repetitive tasks with little change. But the more boring the work, the easier it is to have machines do it instead.
