He learned early on that swearing is bad and that you should only use polite language. He was told that only bad people drink alcohol, and that smoking is not for good people. He also learned that you should never lie. Most of all, he was taught that being interested in private parts is wrong.

He knew these ideas came from his mom, and he believed they were what God wanted too. Getting love from his mom, or if she wasn’t paying attention, from his nurse, was the best thing in his life. He only got that love when he behaved well and didn’t break the moral rules.

Because of this, he started to feel like anything his mom or nurse didn’t like was scary or bad. As he got older, he forgot where these rules came from and what would happen if he broke them, but he still felt like something terrible would happen if he did.

Now, many parts of these early lessons don’t make sense and can’t really be used by normal people in everyday life.
