Having got this principle accepted, he would get all the finest birds put to death, and in the end a really splendid tail will become only a dim memory of the past. Such is the victory of envy masquerading as morality. But where every peacock thinks himself more splendid than any of the others, there is no need for all this repression.
 
 Each peacock expects to win the first prize in the competition, and each, because he values his own peahen, believes that he has done so.
 
 Envy is, of course, closely connected with competition. We do not envy a good fortune which we conceive as quite hopelessly out of our reach.
 
 In an age when the social hierarchy is fixed, the lowest classes do not envy the upper classes so long as the division between rich and poor is thought to be ordained by God. Beggars do not envy millionaires, though of course they will envy other beggars who are more successful. The instability of social status in the modern world, and the equalitarian doctrine of democracy and socialism, have greatly extended the range of envy.
