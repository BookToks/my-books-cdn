Once people agree with this idea, they would want to get rid of all the best birds, and soon a really beautiful tail would just be a faint memory. This is what happens when jealousy hides behind what seems like doing the right thing. But if every peacock thinks he’s the best, there’s no need to hold back like this.

Every peacock wants to win first place in the contest, and each one, because he cares about his own peahen, believes he has already won.

Jealousy is closely tied to competition. We don’t feel jealous of things we think we can never have.

In times when social classes don’t change, poor people don’t envy rich people because they believe the division is decided by God. Beggars don’t envy millionaires, but they do envy other beggars who are better off. Today, because social status can change and ideas like democracy and socialism say everyone should be equal, jealousy has spread much more widely.
