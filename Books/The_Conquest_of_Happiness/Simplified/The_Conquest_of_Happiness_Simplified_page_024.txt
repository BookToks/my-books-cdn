Let’s talk about Religious Orders: I’m not leaving anyone out. Look at how they have all fallen from their right place; even the new Orders of Friars have already lost their honor. The whole church group focuses on pride, lust, and greed. Wherever church people gather, like in Paris and Oxford, they cause trouble and shame the regular people with their fights and bad behavior. No one cares how things get done, as long as they can satisfy their own desires.

About the old pagan thinkers, he says their lives were way better than ours. They lived with respect and didn’t care about the world’s fun, riches, or fame. You can read about this in the works of Aristotle, Seneca, Tully, Avicenna, Alfarabius, Plato, Socrates, and others. That’s how they learned wisdom and discovered knowledge.

Roger Bacon thought the same as all the writers of his time—none of them liked the time they lived in. I don’t think this sadness had any deep spiritual reason.
