Sometimes, people start keeping a diary, go to therapy, or maybe become monks. But a monk won’t be happy until the daily routine makes him forget about his own feelings. The happiness he thinks comes from religion could also come from doing a simple job, like cleaning streets, if he had to keep doing it.

For people who are really stuck in themselves, following strict rules is the only way to find happiness.

There are many reasons why people feel unhappy, but they all share something in common. Usually, an unhappy person missed out on something normal when they were young. Because of this, they focus too much on one thing that makes them happy and ignore everything else. They care more about reaching a goal than enjoying what they do.

Sometimes, people feel so blocked that they don’t look for happiness at all. Instead, they just want to avoid their problems and forget everything.
