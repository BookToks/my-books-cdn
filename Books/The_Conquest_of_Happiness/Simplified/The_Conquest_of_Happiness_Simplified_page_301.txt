Some common feelings people have are fear, jealousy, feeling guilty, feeling sorry for themselves, and thinking too much about how great they are. In all these feelings, people focus only on themselves. They don’t really care about the world around them, but worry about getting hurt or not feeling important.

Fear is the main reason why people don’t want to face the truth. They try to protect themselves with comforting lies. But these lies don’t work forever. Problems break through, and people who rely on lies often suffer more than those who face reality from the start. Also, people who lie to themselves usually know deep down they are doing it, and they live in fear that something bad will make them face the truth.

So, what can someone do if they are unhappy because they only think about themselves? If they keep thinking about why they’re unhappy, they stay stuck in their own head. To get out of this, they need to find real interests and care about things outside themselves, not just fake hobbies to feel better.
