But wanting drugs is something you can’t just ignore or let happen naturally. When someone used to drugs doesn’t have them, they feel really bored, and the only thing that helps is time.

This idea about drugs also works for any kind of excitement, but only up to a point. Living with too much excitement all the time is tiring. You need bigger and bigger thrills to feel the fun you want.

Someone used to too much excitement is like a person who loves spicy food so much that normal spice doesn’t even taste spicy to them anymore. Avoiding too much excitement can be a bit boring, but too much excitement not only makes you unhealthy, it also makes you less able to enjoy simple pleasures. It replaces deep satisfaction with quick thrills, clever tricks instead of real wisdom, and sudden shocks instead of true beauty.
