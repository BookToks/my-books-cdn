What works for eating also works for everything else. You can only do things well if you have some kind of excitement or interest, and it’s hard to have that without caring about yourself a little bit.

I would say that caring about people related to you, like wanting to protect your wife and kids, is also a kind of caring about yourself. This kind of caring is normal for humans, but the super high level of selflessness that people often talk about in moral lessons is not normal and almost never really happens.

People who want to think they are very good and moral often trick themselves into believing they are more selfless than they really are. This can make them try to be saint-like in a way that isn’t honest and can even make them feel like they have to judge or attack others.

The second rule we talked about, which says you shouldn’t think you are better than you really are, is already explained by what I just said about morals.
