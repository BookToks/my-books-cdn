This is part of a general way to avoid feeling scared. Worrying is a kind of fear, and all kinds of fear make us tired. A person who learns not to feel fear will feel much less tired every day.

Fear becomes really bad when there is some danger we donâ€™t want to face. Sometimes, scary thoughts suddenly pop into our minds. What those thoughts are depends on the person, but almost everyone has some kind of hidden fear. One person might be scared of cancer, another of losing all their money, another of a secret being found out. Someone else might feel jealous, and another might worry that scary stories about hell are true.

Most people handle their fear the wrong way. When scary thoughts come, they try to think about something else. They distract themselves with fun things, work, or other activities.
