A man who dies defending his country is not blamed even if his wife and kids end up with no money. A man working on a big scientific discovery or invention is also not blamed for his family's poverty if he finally succeeds. But if he never makes the discovery or invention, people often call him crazy, which is unfair because no one knows if they will succeed before trying. A long time ago, during the first 1000 years of the Christian era, a man who left his family to live a holy life was praised. Today, people think he should take care of his family first.

I think there is always a deep difference between someone who overeats and someone who just has a healthy appetite. A person who focuses too much on one desire usually has some hidden problem and is trying to avoid facing it.
