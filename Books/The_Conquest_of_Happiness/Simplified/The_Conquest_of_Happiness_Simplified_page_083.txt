Fears get worse when you try to ignore them. When you avoid thinking about something scary, it shows how frightening that thing really is. The right way to deal with fear is to think about it clearly and calmly, focusing on it until it feels normal. 

Eventually, getting used to it will make it less scary. The topic will become boring, and you won’t have to force yourself to stop thinking about it—it will just stop being interesting. If you catch yourself worrying about something, the best thing to do is to think about it even more than usual, until you lose interest in it.

One problem with how people think about fear today is that only physical bravery, like in war, is expected from men. Other kinds of bravery aren’t expected from men, and no bravery is expected from women. If a woman is brave, she often has to hide it if she wants to be liked by men.
