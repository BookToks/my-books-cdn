Professors in America work for business people, so they don’t get as much respect as they do in older countries. Because of this, professional people in America try to act like businesspeople instead of being their own thing, like in Europe. Among rich people, there is a strong focus on just trying to make money.

From a young age, American boys learn that making money is the most important thing. They don’t want to spend time on education that won’t help them earn money. In the past, education was seen as a way to learn how to enjoy life in special ways that only educated people could appreciate. In the 1700s, being a “gentleman” meant enjoying things like books, art, and music in a thoughtful way.
