I think parents’ feelings are really important, but I don’t believe that moms have to do everything for their kids by themselves. People used to think that moms should do all the work because no one really knew much about how to take care of children except old advice passed down.

Today, we know a lot more about taking care of kids, and some things are better done by experts who have studied those areas. When it comes to school subjects, this makes sense. A mom isn’t expected to teach her son really hard stuff like calculus, even if she loves him a lot. 

For learning school subjects, it’s better for kids to learn from teachers who know more than their moms do.
