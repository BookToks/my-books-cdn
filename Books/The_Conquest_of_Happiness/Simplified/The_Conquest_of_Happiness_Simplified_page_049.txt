Men and women today seem unable to enjoy smart and thoughtful pleasures. For example, having a good, deep conversation, which was very popular in French gatherings in the 1700s, was still common about forty years ago. It was a special skill that used your mind for something small and short-lived. But who has time for that now?

In China, this skill was still strong ten years ago, but I think the efforts of the Nationalists have made it disappear since then. Knowing good literature, which many educated people understood fifty or a hundred years ago, is now something only a few teachers know about. People have stopped enjoying calm and quiet activities.

Some American students took me for a walk in the spring through a forest near their school. It was full of beautiful wildflowers, but not one of them knew the name of a single flower.
