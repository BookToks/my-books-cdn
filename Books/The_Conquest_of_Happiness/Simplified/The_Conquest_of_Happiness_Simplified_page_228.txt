When a mom tries hard to learn how to take care of her kids, she finds it’s really risky to leave them with nurses or other people unless those nurses have had expensive training. 

She has to deal with a lot of little things all the time, and if she isn’t careful, she might lose her fun personality and smart thinking. 

Many times, just doing all the necessary chores makes these women annoying to their husbands and kids. 

At night, when her husband comes home, if she talks about her problems from the day, he gets bored, but if she doesn’t, she seems distracted. 

Because she made big sacrifices to have her children, she often expects too much in return. 

Also, always focusing on small details can make her picky and narrow-minded.
