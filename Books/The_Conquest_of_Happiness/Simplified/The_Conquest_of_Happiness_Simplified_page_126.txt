Chapter 8: Persecution mania

In its worst forms, persecution mania is a type of serious mental illness. Some people believe that others want to hurt them, put them in jail, or do something really bad to them. 

Often, trying to protect themselves from these fake threats makes them act violently, and because of this, they may need to be controlled or kept safe. This kind of mental illness is just an extreme version of a feeling that many normal people sometimes have.

I won’t talk about the worst cases here because those need a doctor who specializes in mental health. Instead, I want to focus on the milder cases. These are common and cause a lot of unhappiness.

Since these milder feelings don’t cause full-blown mental illness, people can often handle them by themselves. But they have to realize that the problem comes from inside them, not from other people being mean or hostile.
