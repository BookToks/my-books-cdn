People who aren’t into the latest trends can feel better knowing that dinosaurs didn’t win in the end; they wiped each other out, and smarter creatures took over. Our modern "dinosaurs" are doing the same to themselves. Most don’t have even two kids per family because they don’t enjoy life enough to want children.

This strict way of thinking, passed down from their Puritan ancestors, doesn’t fit the world today. People who are so unhappy that they don’t want kids are likely to die out. Soon, happier and more cheerful people will take their place.

Thinking that life is all about competition is too harsh and stressful. It’s too much about strength and willpower to be a good way to live for more than a generation or two.
