Many people get upset or angry over every small thing that goes wrong, and this wastes a lot of energy that could be used better. Even when working on really important goals, it’s not smart to get so emotional that the fear of failing always bothers your peace of mind.

Christianity teaches to accept God’s will, and even if someone doesn’t believe this exactly, they should have a similar calm attitude in everything they do. Being good at a task doesn’t depend on how emotional you are; sometimes, too much emotion can actually make you less effective. The right way is to do your best and then leave the rest to chance.

There are two kinds of giving up: one comes from feeling hopeless, the other from strong hope. The first is bad; the second is good. A person who feels totally defeated and stops hoping for real success may give up on trying seriously. They might hide this feeling by using religious words or saying thinking deeply is the real goal, but no matter what, they stay unhappy and don’t do much good.
