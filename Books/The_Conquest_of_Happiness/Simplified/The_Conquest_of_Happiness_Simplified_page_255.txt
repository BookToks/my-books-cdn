Making choices all the time is really tiring. Most people actually like being told what to do every hour, as long as the tasks aren’t too bad. 

Lots of rich people who don’t have to work get super bored because they don’t have to do any hard work. Sometimes they try to have fun by going on big hunting trips in Africa or flying around the world, but those exciting things don’t last forever, especially when they get older.

So, smarter rich men end up working almost as much as poor people, while rich women usually keep busy with lots of small tasks that they think are really important.

Because of this, work is good mostly because it stops people from getting bored. Being bored while doing boring jobs is nothing compared to the boredom of having nothing to do all day.
