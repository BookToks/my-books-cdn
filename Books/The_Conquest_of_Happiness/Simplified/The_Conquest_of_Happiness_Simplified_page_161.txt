Today, we are losing a kind of social freedom, so it’s important to understand why being too similar to others can be a problem. I’m not saying people should try to be weird on purpose, because that’s just as boring as trying to be normal. I just mean that people should be themselves and follow what they like, as long as it doesn’t hurt others.

Because we can travel so fast now, people don’t have to rely on their closest neighbors like they used to. If someone has a car, they can think of anyone living within twenty miles as their neighbor.

This means people have a lot more choice in who they spend time with. In crowded areas, it’s pretty unlikely someone won’t find friends they like within twenty miles. The idea that you have to know the people right next door has mostly disappeared in big cities but still exists in small towns and the countryside. This idea is kind of silly now because you don’t have to depend on your immediate neighbors for social connections.
