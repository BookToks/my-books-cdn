Paul’s steeple is gone now, and I don’t know when the hedges between St Paul’s and London Bridge disappeared. It’s been many centuries since London’s boys could have fun like this rhyme talks about. But not too long ago, most people lived in the countryside.

The towns were small back then, so it was easy to leave them. Many houses even had gardens.

Today, most people in England live in cities, not the countryside. In America, more people are moving to cities too, but not as many yet.

People with average money have to live in very small spaces.
