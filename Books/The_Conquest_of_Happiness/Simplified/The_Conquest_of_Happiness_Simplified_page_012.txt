He then becomes someone who only cares about having fun.  

This means he tries to make life easier by feeling less alive. For example, getting drunk is like a temporary way of escaping yourself; the happiness it gives is just stopping the sadness for a short time. People who are selfish or think they are better than others believe happiness is real, even if they try the wrong ways to get it. But someone who looks for a high or escape, in any form, has given up hope except in forgetting everything. The first thing to do with this person is to help them see that being happy is something worth wanting. People who are unhappy, like those who don’t sleep well, often feel proud about it.  

Maybe their pride is like a fox who lost its tail; if that’s true, the way to help is to show them they can grow a new tail. I believe very few people would choose to be unhappy if they knew how to be happy. I’m not saying these people don’t exist, but there aren’t enough of them to matter much. So, I will assume you want to be happy rather than unhappy.
