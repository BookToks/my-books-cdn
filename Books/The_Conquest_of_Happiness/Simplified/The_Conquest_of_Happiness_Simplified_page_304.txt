Only things that really interest you can help you, but you can be sure that real interests will start to grow once you stop being focused only on yourself.

A happy life is mostly the same as a good life. Experts have made too much of giving things up, and this puts the focus in the wrong place. When you try to give things up on purpose, you end up thinking a lot about yourself and what you have lost. Because of this, it usually doesnâ€™t work and often fails to reach its real goal.

What you need is not to give things up, but to shift your attention outward. This will naturally lead you to do the same good things that someone trying hard to be good would do by forcing themselves to give things up. I wrote this book as a hedonist, meaning I believe happiness is the main good. But the actions I suggest for happiness are mostly the same as those a reasonable moral person would recommend.
