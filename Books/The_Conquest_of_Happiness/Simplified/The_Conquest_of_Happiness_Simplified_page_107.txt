Conscience is no longer seen as something mysterious that people think is the voice of God.

We know that conscience tells people to do different things in different parts of the world, and usually it agrees with what their tribe or group believes. So, what really happens when someone feels guilty?

The word ‘conscience’ actually covers several feelings. The simplest feeling is the fear of being caught. You, reading this, have probably lived a good life, but if you ask someone who has done something wrong and could get in trouble if people found out, you’ll see that when they thought they might be caught, they felt sorry for what they did. I’m not talking about a professional thief who expects to go to jail as part of their life, but about people like a Bank Manager who stole money during a stressful time, or a priest who gave in to temptation.
