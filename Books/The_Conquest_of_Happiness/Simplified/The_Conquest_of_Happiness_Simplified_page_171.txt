He has a job that uses all his skills, and he gets results that seem important not only to him but also to the public, even if they don’t understand them at all. This is better for him than it is for an artist. When people don’t understand a painting or a poem, they think it’s bad. But when they don’t understand something like the theory of relativity, they know it’s because they didn’t learn enough.

Because of this, Einstein is respected while the best painters struggle and live in poor places. Einstein is happy, but the painters are unhappy. Very few people can be truly happy if they have to keep proving themselves to a crowd that doesn’t believe in them, unless they lock themselves away with others like them and ignore the outside world.

A scientist doesn’t need a small group like that because most people think well of him, except other scientists. But an artist has a hard choice: they can be disliked or become someone people look down on. If an artist is really talented, they will suffer one of these problems – people will either hate them if they show their talent or think less of them if they don’t.
