If you are sailing on a nice day along a beautiful coast, you enjoy looking at the coast just because it is nice. This happiness comes from looking outside and doesn’t come from any urgent need you have.

But if your ship breaks and you swim to the coast, you start to love it for a different reason: it means safety from the dangerous waves. Whether the coast is pretty or ugly doesn’t really matter anymore. 

The better kind of love is like the feeling of someone whose ship is safe. The less good kind is like the feeling of the person who is swimming after a shipwreck. The first kind happens when a person feels safe or doesn’t care about dangers around them. The second kind happens because the person feels unsafe.

Love that comes from feeling unsafe is more about yourself because you like the person or thing for what it does for you, not for who they really are. But I’m not saying this kind of love isn’t important. Actually, most real love has a bit of both kinds mixed together. When love helps someone feel safe, it lets them enjoy the world again, even after scary or dangerous times.
