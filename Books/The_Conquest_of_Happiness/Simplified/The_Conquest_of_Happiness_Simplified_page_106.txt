Chapter 7: The sense of sin

We talked a little about the feeling of sin in Chapter 1, but now we need to explain it more because it’s one of the main reasons adults feel unhappy.

In the past, many religious people believed that our conscience tells us when something we want to do is wrong. They thought that after doing something wrong, people could feel two kinds of bad feelings. One is called remorse, which is just feeling bad with no way to fix it. The other is called repentance, which means feeling sorry and trying to make things right.

Even when some people stopped believing in religion, many still believed in these old ideas about sin, especially in Protestant countries. But today, because of things like psychoanalysis, many people don’t believe in the old ideas anymore. This includes not only people who don’t follow the church but also some who still say they do.
