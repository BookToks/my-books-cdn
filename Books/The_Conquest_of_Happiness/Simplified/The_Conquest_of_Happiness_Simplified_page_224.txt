Chapter 13: The family

Out of all the traditions we have from the past, the family is one of the most messed up today. Parents loving their kids and kids loving their parents can bring a lot of happiness, but right now, most of the time, parents and kids donâ€™t get along and it makes both of them unhappy. In nearly every case, one of them ends up feeling bad.

The family not making people happy like it should is a big reason why many people feel upset nowadays. Adults who want to have a good relationship with their kids or want their kids to be happy need to think carefully about what being a parent really means. After thinking, they need to make smart choices.

The topic of family is too big to fully talk about here, except for how it connects to finding happiness. Even then, we can only talk about how each person can make things better for themselves, without changing how society works.
