If he is a worried person, I don’t think anything less than this will help him feel better.

A person who stops worrying all the time will find life much happier than before when he was always annoyed. Little habits of people he knows, which used to make him want to scream, will now just seem funny.

When Mr. A. tells the same story about the Bishop of Tierra del Fuego for the three hundred and forty-seventh time, he just counts how many times he’s heard it and doesn’t feel like trying to tell his own story. When his shoelace breaks just as he’s rushing to catch an early train, after saying a few bad words, he thinks that in the grand scheme of things, this isn’t a big deal.

If he is interrupted by a boring neighbor while trying to propose marriage, he remembers that everyone has problems, even people like Adams, and that everyone faces troubles sometimes.
