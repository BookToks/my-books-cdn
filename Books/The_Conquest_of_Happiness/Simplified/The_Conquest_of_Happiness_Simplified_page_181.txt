This is totally wrong; any fun that doesn’t hurt other people should be appreciated. For me, I like collecting rivers: I feel happy remembering when I traveled down the Volga and up the Yangtse, and I really wish I had seen the Amazon or the Orinoco. These feelings are simple, but I’m not ashamed of them.

Think about a baseball fan who is super excited: he reads his newspaper eagerly, and listening to the radio gives him the biggest thrills. I remember meeting a famous American writer for the first time. I thought his books were sad, but when the baseball scores came on the radio, he forgot everything else and shouted happily when his team won. After that, I could read his books without feeling sad about his characters.

However, many hobbies and trends don’t bring true happiness. Instead, they help people forget their problems for a little while when life is too hard to handle.
