Even the luckiest people have times when things go wrong. Most men who are married have had arguments with their wives. Most parents have worried a lot when their kids were sick. Most business people have gone through tough money times. Most professionals have faced moments when they felt like they might fail.

During these hard times, being able to focus on something else is really helpful. When you can't do anything about your problems right away, some people play chess, some read detective stories, some get interested in stars and space, and others read about old ancient places.

All of these things are smart choices. But if someone just sits and thinks about their problems all the time without trying to distract themselves, they are not helping themselves. This makes it harder for them to handle their problems when they need to.
