If someone makes mistakes but does it happily and without care, not to be rude but just naturally, even very strict people might accept it. Over time, it might be possible to become a "licensed lunatic," someone allowed to do things others can’t without getting in trouble.

This mostly depends on being nice and friendly. People who follow the rules get angry when others break them because they think it’s a personal attack. But they will forgive a lot if the person is cheerful and friendly enough to show they’re not trying to criticize anyone.

However, this way of avoiding trouble doesn’t work for many people who have different tastes or opinions from most others. Because they don’t feel connected to the group, they feel uneasy and often act defensive, even if they try to follow the rules or stay out of trouble.
