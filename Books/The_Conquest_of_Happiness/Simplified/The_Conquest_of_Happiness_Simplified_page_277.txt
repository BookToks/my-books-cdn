If you fail at what you’re trying to do right now, you can still feel okay because you know it’s only temporary. You won’t give up your values just to win. You have bigger goals that take time, and you’re not alone—you’re part of a huge group of people who’ve helped make the world a better place. If you think like this, you’ll feel a deep kind of happiness no matter what happens to you personally. Life will feel connected to all the great people who came before you, and dying won’t seem like a big deal.

If I could change higher education, I’d replace old religious ideas—which most young people don’t really follow, especially the smartest ones—with something different. It wouldn’t really be a religion, but more like focusing on real facts that everyone can agree on.
