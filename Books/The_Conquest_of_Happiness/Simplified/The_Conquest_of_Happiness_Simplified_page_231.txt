If there are little kids, living in an apartment is hard. There isn’t enough space for them to play, and their parents can’t get away from the noise. Because of this, professional men often choose to live in the suburbs.

This is definitely better for the kids, but it makes the man’s life more tiring and means he can’t spend as much time with his family.

I don’t want to talk about big money problems here because they are not the main issue. The main problem is what each person can do right now to be happy. We get closer to this when we look at the mental struggles between parents and kids today. These problems are part of what democracy brings. In the past, there were masters and slaves: the masters made all the decisions and usually liked their slaves because the slaves helped make them happy.
