The reason for this is not that we feel worse about life, but actually the opposite. It’s because we don’t see some people as more important than others, with the right to big, dramatic feelings, while everyone else just works hard to make their greatness possible. Shakespeare says: When poor people die, no stars appear; only the death of princes lights up the sky.

Back in Shakespeare’s time, most people believed this idea, or at least accepted it, including Shakespeare himself. That’s why the death of Cinna the poet is funny, but the deaths of Caesar, Brutus, and Cassius are serious and sad. 

Now, we don’t see any one person’s death as having huge meaning because we believe everyone is equal inside, not just on the surface. So today, big tragedies are more about what happens to the whole group or community, not just one person.
