This is the worst kind of unfairness she has to deal with: because she does her duty for her family, she loses their love. But if she had ignored them and stayed happy and fun, they probably would have loved her.

This whole problem, especially for people with jobs, is explained really well in a book called The Retreat from Parenthood by Jean Ayling.

These problems are mostly about money. Another big problem is about housing because lots of people live close together in big cities.

In the Middle Ages, cities were as countryside-like as the country is now. Kids still sing a nursery rhyme:

Upon Paulâ€™s steeple stands a tree  
As full of apples as may be,  
The little boys of London town  
They run with sticks to knock them down.
