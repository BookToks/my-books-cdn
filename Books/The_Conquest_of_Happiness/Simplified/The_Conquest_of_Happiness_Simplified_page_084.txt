A man who is brave in everything except facing physical danger is often seen in a bad way. Ignoring what people think, for example, is seen as a challenge, and people try to punish anyone who goes against their rules. This is the opposite of what should happen.

All kinds of bravery, in both men and women, should be respected just like the bravery soldiers show. Since many young men are physically brave, it shows that courage can come from what people expect. If people had more courage, they would worry less and feel less tired because a lot of the tiredness people feel comes from fears they know or donâ€™t know about.

A common cause of feeling tired is wanting excitement. If a person could rest during free time, they would stay healthy, but work can be boring, so they look for fun when they are free.
