Being happy is actually pretty simple, but smart people sometimes can’t admit what they really need to be happy. The women we talked about earlier who feel jealous of every well-dressed woman probably aren’t happy with their natural feelings.

True, natural happiness is hard to find in English-speaking countries, especially for women. Society seems to have lost its way when it comes to this. If we want less jealousy, we need to find a way to fix this problem. If we don’t, our society might fall apart because of too much hate.

In the past, people only felt jealous of their neighbors because they didn’t know much about others. Now, through school and the news, they know a lot about big groups of people they don’t personally know. Movies show them how rich people live, newspapers tell them about bad things in other countries, and propaganda makes them believe that people with different skin colors are doing bad things.
