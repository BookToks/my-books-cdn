Slaves might have hated their masters, but not as much as people who believe in democracy think. Even if slaves did hate their masters, the masters didn’t know, and the masters were still happy. When democratic ideas became popular, things changed: slaves who used to accept their situation stopped accepting it; masters who were sure about their power started to feel unsure. This caused problems and unhappiness for both sides. I’m not saying this means democracy is bad, because problems like these happen whenever big changes happen.

But we can’t ignore the fact that while these changes are happening, life becomes uncomfortable.

A good example of this change is between parents and children. Parents aren’t sure about their authority anymore, and children don’t always feel like they have to respect their parents.
