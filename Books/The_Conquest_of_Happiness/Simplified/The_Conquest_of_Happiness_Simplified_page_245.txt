There is a close mix of power and kindness between a parent and a child. The baby is helpless, and the parent feels a strong need to take care of it. This need makes the parent feel both love and control.

As long as the baby is helpless, the parent's care doesn’t feel selfish because it’s natural to protect something weak that is part of yourself. But very early on, there is a struggle between wanting to have power over the child and wanting what’s best for the child.

While parents naturally have some control, it’s important for the child to learn to be independent as soon as possible. This can be hard for parents who like feeling in control. Some parents never notice this struggle and act like bosses until the kids fight back.

Other parents do notice the struggle and feel confused because they have mixed feelings about love and control.
