A perfectly good person, if we stopped being so strict and serious, would enjoy good things as long as they don’t cause any harm. Let’s think about lying again. I agree there is way too much lying in the world, and we would all be better if people told the truth more often. But I don’t believe, and I think no reasonable person would, that lying is always wrong no matter what.

Once, while walking in the countryside, I saw a very tired fox trying hard to keep running. A few minutes later, some hunters came by and asked if I had seen the fox. I said yes, but when they asked which way it went, I lied to them. I don’t think I would have been a better person if I had told the truth.

But the biggest problem is with how we learn about sex when we are young. If a child is raised by strict parents or caregivers, they often learn to think of sex as something bad or sinful by the time they are six years old. This idea is so strong that it’s hard to change it later in life.
