People who don’t fit in with the rules or habits of their group often feel tense, uncomfortable, and not very happy. But when these same people are in a different group where their ideas aren’t seen as weird, they can seem like a totally different person. They might go from being serious, shy, and quiet to being cheerful and confident. They might change from being awkward to being relaxed and friendly. Or they might stop being self-focused and start enjoying hanging out with others.

So, whenever possible, young people who don’t feel comfortable where they are should try to pick a job that lets them be around people they get along with, even if it means earning less money.

Many times, they don’t even realize this is an option because they don’t know much about the world, and they might think the rules they grew up with at home are the same everywhere.
