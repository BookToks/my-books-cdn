Even though this problem is real, he can still do a lot if he understands what’s wrong. 

For example, if his problem comes from feeling guilty, either on purpose or without realizing it, he can first convince his conscious mind that he has no reason to feel guilty. Then, using the techniques we talked about earlier, he can help his unconscious mind believe this too, while doing some simple activity. 

If he can get rid of the guilt, real interests will probably start to appear on their own. 

If his problem is feeling sorry for himself, he can fix it the same way, after convincing himself that his situation isn’t really that bad. 

If fear is his problem, he should practice exercises that build courage. People have always seen courage in battle as very important, and a big part of training boys and young men has been about helping them become fearless fighters.
