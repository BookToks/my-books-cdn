Obedience used to be expected without question, but now people don’t think it’s cool, and that’s a good thing. Parents who know about psychology are scared they might accidentally hurt their kids. If they kiss their kids, they worry it might cause problems; if they don’t, they worry the kids might get jealous. If they tell kids what to do, they think it might make them feel guilty; if they don’t, the kids might pick up bad habits. When they see a baby sucking their thumb, they get scared and don’t know how to stop it.

Being a parent used to feel like having control, but now it feels scary and full of worries. The simple happy moments are gone, even though moms today have to give up a lot more because many women choose to have kids on their own. Because of this, careful moms ask too little from their kids, and less careful moms ask too much. Careful moms hold back their love and become shy; less careful moms try to get their happiness from their kids.
