When you think about human nature without considering today’s world, it’s clear to me that being a parent can bring the greatest and longest-lasting happiness in life. 

This is probably more true for women than men, but it’s still more true for men than most people today realize. This idea is common in almost all old stories. For example, Hecuba cared more about her kids than her husband Priam, and MacDuff cared more about his children than his wife. 

In the Old Testament, both men and women really wanted to have children to carry on their family. In places like China and Japan, this feeling has stayed strong even until now. Some people say this is because of ancestor worship.

But I think it’s actually the other way around. Ancestor worship happens because people care about keeping their family going. 

Going back to the professional women we talked about earlier, it’s clear the desire to have kids must be very strong. Otherwise, none of them would make the sacrifices needed to have children.
