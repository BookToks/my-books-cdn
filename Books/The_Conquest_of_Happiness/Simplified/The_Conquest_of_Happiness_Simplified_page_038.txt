Ask him what happened to his friends after they lost everything.

Everyone knows that a businessman who has lost everything is still better off in terms of comfort than someone who never had enough money to lose in the first place. So, when people talk about the struggle for life, they really mean the struggle to be successful. What people worry about isn’t missing breakfast, but about not being better than their neighbors.

It’s strange how little people realize they are not stuck in a system they can’t escape. They stay on the treadmill just because they don’t see that it doesn’t actually take them anywhere higher. I’m talking about men in big businesses who already make good money and could live comfortably if they wanted. But quitting would feel like running away from a battle, even though if you ask them what important reason they have for working so hard, they can’t really answer beyond repeating fancy sayings about working hard and living fully.
