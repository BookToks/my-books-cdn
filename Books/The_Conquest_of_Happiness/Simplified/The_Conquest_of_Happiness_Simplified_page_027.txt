The best example, I suppose, is Robert Browning. I cannot, however, resist the conviction that there is something stuffy about love as he conceived it.
 
 God be thanked, the meanest of His creatures Boasts two soul-sides, one to face the world with, One to show a woman when he loves her!
 
 This assumes that combativeness is the only possible attitude towards the world at large. Why?
 
 Because the world is cruel, Browning would say.
 
 Because it will not accept you at your own valuation, we should say. A couple may form, as the Brownings did, a mutual admiration society. It is very pleasant to have someone at hand who is sure to praise your work, whether it deserves it or not. And Browning undoubtedly felt that he was a fine, manly fellow when he denounced Fitzgerald in no measured terms for having dared not to admire Aurora Leigh. I cannot feel that this complete suspension of the critical faculty on both sides is really admirable.
