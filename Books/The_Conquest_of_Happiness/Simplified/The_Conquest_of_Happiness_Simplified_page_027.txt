The best example, I guess, is Robert Browning. But I honestly think his idea of love feels kind of old-fashioned and boring.

Thank goodness, even the simplest people have two sides to their soul. One side they show to the world, and the other they show to the person they love!

This idea means that the only way to act toward the world is to be tough and ready to fight. But why?

Because the world is harsh, Browning would say.

Because the world won’t accept you for who you really are, we would say. Sometimes couples, like the Brownings, just admire each other a lot. It feels nice to have someone who always praises you, even if you don’t always deserve it. Browning probably felt proud of himself when he harshly criticized Fitzgerald for not liking Aurora Leigh.

But I don’t think it’s really good to stop being honest and critical with each other like that.
