The habit of always wanting to compete can show up in places where it doesn’t really fit. For example, think about reading. People read for two reasons: one, because they enjoy it; two, so they can brag about it. 

In America, many ladies try to read (or at least pretend to read) certain books every month. Some actually read the whole book, some only the first chapter, and some just read the reviews. But all of them have these books on their tables. They don’t read any classic great books though. There has never been a month when Book Clubs picked Hamlet or King Lear, and no one feels the need to know about Dante. 

Because of this, people mostly read average modern books, not the really famous and important ones. This is also because of competition. But maybe it’s not all bad, since if these ladies were on their own, they might choose to read even worse books than the ones their book clubs pick.

The focus on competing so much in today’s life is linked to a general decline in good manners and culture, kind of like what happened in Rome after the Augustan age.
