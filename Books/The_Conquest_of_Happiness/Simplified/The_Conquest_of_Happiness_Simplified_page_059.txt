Wanting to get away from boredom is normal; in fact, all kinds of people have shown this whenever they had the chance. When native people first tried alcohol given by white men, they finally found a way to escape their old, boring lives, and unless the Government stopped them, they often drank themselves into wild and dangerous situations.

Wars, attacks, and unfair treatment have all been ways people try to avoid boredom; even fighting with neighbors has been seen as better than doing nothing.

Because of this, boredom is a big problem for people who care about right and wrong, since at least half of human mistakes happen because people are afraid of being bored.

But boredom isn’t always bad. There are two types: one that helps us grow and one that makes us stop learning. The good kind happens when we don’t use drugs, and the bad kind happens when we don’t have enough exciting or important things to do. I don’t want to say drugs are never helpful. For example, sometimes a smart doctor will give you medicine with drugs in it, and I think this happens more often than people who want to ban drugs believe.
