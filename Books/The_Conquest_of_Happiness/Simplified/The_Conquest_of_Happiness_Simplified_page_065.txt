A boy or young man who has a serious goal will willingly put up with a lot of boredom if he knows it’s necessary. But it’s hard for a boy to develop serious goals if he’s always distracted and chasing fun, because then he’s always thinking about the next good time instead of working toward something important in the future.

For these reasons, a generation that can’t handle boredom will become weak and shallow, like people who are out of touch with the natural slow pace of life. Their energy and motivation will fade away, like flowers cut and left in a vase.

I don’t like using fancy or mystical words, but it’s hard to explain what I mean without sounding poetic. No matter what we think, we are part of the Earth; our lives depend on it just like plants and animals do. Life on Earth moves slowly; autumn and winter are just as important as spring and summer, and rest is just as important as activity.
