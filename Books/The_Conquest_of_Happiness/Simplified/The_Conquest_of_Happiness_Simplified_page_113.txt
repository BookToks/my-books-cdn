This feeling comes from something called the Oedipus complex, where the woman a boy loves most as a child is someone he can’t have a normal sexual relationship with.

Because of this, many grown-up men think women lose respect when they enjoy sex, and they can’t respect their wives if their wives like sex. But if a wife doesn’t want sex, the man will naturally look for satisfaction somewhere else. Even if he finds it, he will feel guilty, so he won’t be happy with any woman, whether he’s married or not.

For women, a similar thing happens if they are taught to be very “pure.” They hold back in sex with their husbands and are scared to enjoy it. But today, fewer women feel this way compared to fifty years ago.
