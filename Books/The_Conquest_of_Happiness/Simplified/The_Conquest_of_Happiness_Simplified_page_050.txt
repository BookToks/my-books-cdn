What good would this knowledge do?

It wouldn’t help anyone make more money.

The problem isn’t just with one person, and one person alone can’t fix it. The problem comes from the common idea that life is like a competition, where the winner gets respect. This idea makes people focus too much on willpower and not enough on their feelings and thinking. Or maybe we're thinking about it the wrong way. In the past, Puritan moralists mostly talked about faith, but now they focus on willpower.

Maybe years of Puritan thinking made people who have too much willpower but not enough attention to their feelings and minds. So, those people picked competition as the best way to live.

Whatever the reason, these powerful people who care more about control than being smart are really successful. Because of that, many others try to be like them. They have become the example for white people everywhere, and this will probably keep happening for the next hundred years.
