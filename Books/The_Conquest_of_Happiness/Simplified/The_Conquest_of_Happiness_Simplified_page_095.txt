"Yes," says the jealous man, "today is sunny, it’s spring, the birds are singing, and the flowers are blooming. But I’ve heard that spring in Sicily is a thousand times more beautiful, the birds sing better in the Helicon woods, and the rose of Sharon is way prettier than any flower in my garden."

As he thinks this, the sun seems less bright, the birds’ songs sound like meaningless noise, and the flowers don’t seem special at all. He feels the same way about everything else in life.

"Yes," he tells himself, "the girl I love is beautiful, and she loves me too, but the Queen of Sheba must have been so much more amazing! Oh, if only I had Solomon’s chances!"

But comparing like this is pointless and silly. Whether it’s the Queen of Sheba or the neighbor next door that makes you unhappy, it’s all useless. A wise person enjoys what they have without stopping just because someone else has something different.
