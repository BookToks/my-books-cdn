A person who has enough energy and enthusiasm will get through tough times because, after every setback, they find new things in life and the world to care about. They don’t let one loss ruin everything.

Giving up after one or even several losses isn’t something to be proud of; it shows a lack of strength. Anyone we love can die at any time, so our feelings are always at risk. That’s why our lives shouldn’t depend too much on just one thing that could suddenly be lost.

For these reasons, a smart person who wants to be happy will try to have many different interests besides the main things that matter most to them.
