We get bored less often than people did a long time ago, but we are more scared of feeling bored. We have learned, or at least believe, that boredom is not something we have to accept, and we can avoid it by always looking for fun and excitement.

Girls today earn their own money, mostly because it lets them have fun in the evenings and avoid the ‘happy family time’ that their grandmothers had to deal with. Most people live in cities; in America, if they don’t, they have a car or at least a motorbike to go to the movies. And of course, they have radios at home.

Young men and women meet each other much more easily than before, and every housemaid expects to have at least one exciting night a week—more than what a Jane Austen character would have in a whole book.
