Often, when people complain about how others act, it's really just a normal reaction to someone who is being too selfish and greedy.

The fourth important idea we talked about is understanding that other people think about you way less than you think about yourself. Someone who is crazy with paranoia believes that lots of people, who actually have their own lives and interests, are spending all day trying to harm them.

A person who is a little less crazy but still paranoid thinks everything people do is about them, even when it’s not true. This idea makes them feel important. If they really were a big deal, maybe it would be true. For example, the British Government spent many years trying to stop Napoleon. But when an ordinary person thinks everyone is always thinking about them, that’s a sign they might be losing their mind.
