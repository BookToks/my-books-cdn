People get really angry when they miss a train, super upset if their dinner is cooked badly, feel very sad if the chimney smokes, and promise to fight back against the whole system when their clothes don’t come back from the laundry. The energy they waste on these small problems could be used, if they were smarter, to do amazing things.

A wise person doesn’t notice the dust the cleaner missed, the potato the cook didn’t cook, or the soot the chimney sweep forgot.

I don’t mean they ignore these problems if they have time to fix them. I mean they handle them calmly without getting upset. Worrying and getting irritated don’t help. People who feel these emotions strongly might say they can’t stop themselves, and maybe they need to accept things as they are to get over it. 

Focusing on big, important hopes helps someone deal with personal failures or a tough marriage. It also helps them stay calm when they miss a train or drop their umbrella in the mud.
