Chapter 16: Effort and Giving Up

The idea of the golden mean, or finding the middle ground, isn’t very exciting. When I was younger, I didn’t like it at all. I thought it was boring because I admired people who went to heroic extremes.

But the truth isn’t always exciting. People often believe things just because they sound interesting, even if there isn’t much proof.

The golden mean is one example. It might seem dull, but in many cases, it’s actually true.

One important place to use the golden mean is when deciding how much effort to put in versus when to accept things and give up. Some people believe you should always accept your fate, like saints and mystics do. Others believe you should always work hard and push yourself, like efficiency experts and strong-minded Christians.

Both sides are partly right, but neither has the whole truth. In this chapter, I want to find a balance between these two ideas, and I’ll start by talking about why effort is important.
