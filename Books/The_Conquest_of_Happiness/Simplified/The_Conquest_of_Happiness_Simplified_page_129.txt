Almost everyone has a problem with gossip, especially when it's mean. Most people find it hard not to say bad things about others, even their friends. But when they hear someone said something mean about them, they are shocked and upset.

They don’t realize that just like they talk about others, others talk about them too. This way of thinking can get worse and even make people feel like everyone is out to get them.

We want everyone to like us and respect us as much as we like and respect ourselves. But we don’t think about the fact that others probably don’t think better of us than we think of them. This happens because we see our own good points clearly, but we don’t notice the good points in others unless we’re being very kind.

When you hear someone said something bad about you, you often remember all the times you didn’t say anything bad about them. But you forget the one time you said something honest and true about them without thinking.
