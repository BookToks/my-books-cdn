Think about the difference between love and just being attracted to someone.

Love is something that makes you feel completely new and alive, like plants after rain during a dry time. But when people have sex without love, it doesn’t do this. After the quick fun is over, you feel tired, unhappy, and like life doesn’t really mean much. Love is part of real life on Earth; sex without love isn’t.

The kind of boredom many people in cities feel is connected to being cut off from nature. It makes life feel hot, dry, and empty, like walking in a desert. Rich people who can choose how to live often feel a special kind of boredom because they are scared of being bored. Trying to avoid this kind of boredom makes them stuck in an even worse kind.

A happy life needs to be calm and peaceful because true happiness can only grow in quiet.
