I don’t want to say that being excited is always bad. A little excitement is good, but like most things, it’s about balance. Too little excitement can make you feel strange and want more, while too much can make you really tired. So, being able to deal with boredom is important for a happy life, and young people should learn this.

All great books have boring parts, and all great lives have dull moments.

Think about a modern American book publisher who gets the Old Testament as a new book to publish. It’s easy to guess what they might say, especially about the family trees.

They might say, “My friend, this chapter is boring; you can’t expect readers to care about a long list of names when you don’t tell much about the people. You started your story well, and I liked it at first, but you try to tell everything, and that’s too much.”
