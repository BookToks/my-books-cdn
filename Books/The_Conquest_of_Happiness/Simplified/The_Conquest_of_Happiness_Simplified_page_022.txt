This idea is totally right for some smart people, especially those who studied literature. They don’t really understand the modern world. When they were young, they were taught to believe things based on feelings. Because of that, they still want safety and protection like kids do. But science can’t give them that.

Mr. Krutch, like many writers, thinks science hasn’t kept its promises. He doesn’t say what those promises were, but he seems to believe that scientists like Darwin and Huxley expected something from science sixty years ago that it didn’t deliver. I think this is completely wrong. This wrong idea comes from writers and church leaders who want people to think their jobs are important.

It’s true that many people are feeling negative about the world right now.
