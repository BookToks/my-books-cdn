If someone tried to explain these ideas like a modern thinker, it might go like this: People work hard all the time, and everything is always moving and changing, but nothing lasts forever. Even though something new comes after something old, it’s really not much different. A man dies, and his child gets what he worked for; rivers flow into the sea, but their water doesn’t stay there. This cycle of things being born and dying goes on and on without any real progress or lasting success, day after day, year after year. If rivers were smart, they would stay where they are. If Solomon were wise, he wouldn’t plant fruit trees just for his son to enjoy later.

But if you think about it in a different way, it doesn’t seem the same at all.

Is there really nothing new in the world? What about tall skyscrapers, airplanes, and politicians’ speeches on TV? Solomon didn’t know about these things. Actually, Ecclesiastes wasn’t really written by Solomon, but people like to talk as if he did. If Solomon could hear the Queen of Sheba’s speech to her people after visiting his kingdom, wouldn’t it have made him feel better about his useless trees and pools?
