First, there’s the rush to catch the morning train, which can make you feel sick. By the time the worker arrives at the office and starts the day, they are already stressed out and annoyed with people.

Their boss comes in feeling the same way and doesn’t help make things better. Workers act polite because they are scared of losing their job, but pretending only makes them more stressed.

If workers could once a week tease their boss and show how they really feel, it might help them relax. But it wouldn’t help the boss, who has problems too. Just like workers fear getting fired, bosses worry about going bankrupt. Some bosses are strong enough not to fear this, but to get to that level, they usually had to work really hard for many years. During that time, they had to pay close attention to everything happening around the world and stop their competitors from getting ahead.
