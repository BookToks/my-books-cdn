You can stop feeling jealous by enjoying the good things in your life, doing the work you need to do, and not comparing yourself to people you think are luckier than you (even if that’s not true).

Being too modest can make jealousy worse. People say modesty is a good thing, but I’m not sure it’s always that great when taken too far.

Modest people often need a lot of encouragement and don’t try things they can actually do. They think others around them are better, which makes them more likely to feel jealous and unhappy.

I believe it’s good to teach boys to feel proud of themselves. I don’t think a peacock ever envies another peacock’s tail, because each one believes their own tail is the best.
