This is a big problem because family unhappiness today comes from many different reasons, like feelings, money, society, education, and politics.

For rich people, two main things make women see having kids as much harder than before. First, single women can now have jobs. Second, there are fewer people to help with housework.

In the past, women had to get married because being single was really hard. Single women had to live at home, depending on their dad or a brother for money. They had nothing to do all day and couldn’t go out for fun outside their big family home. They didn’t have chances or want to have sex outside of marriage, which they thought was very wrong.
