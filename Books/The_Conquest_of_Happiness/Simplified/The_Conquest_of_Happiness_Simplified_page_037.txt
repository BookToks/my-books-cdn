Chapter 3: Competition

If you ask any man in America, or any man doing business in England, what bothers him most about life, he will say: "The struggle for life." He will say this honestly and really believe it.

In some ways, this is true, but in another important way, it is very wrong. The struggle for life does happen sometimes. It can happen to any of us if we are unlucky.

For example, in a story by Conrad, the hero Falk was on an abandoned ship. He was one of two men with guns, and they had nothing to eat but the other men. When they ran out of food they both agreed on, a real fight for survival started. Falk won, but after that, he became a vegetarian.

But this is not what business people mean when they talk about the "struggle for life." They use this phrase wrongly to make something small sound more serious. If you ask them how many people in their social group have actually died from hunger, the answer would be very few or none.
