Idealism makes simple reasons look complicated, so a little bit of realistic doubt is helpful in leaders. Normal ideas about right and wrong teach us to care about others more than we really can, and people who think they are very good often believe they reach this impossible goal.

Most people, even the best ones, do things mostly for themselves, and this isn’t a bad thing because if it were different, humans couldn’t survive. A person who only helped others and forgot to take care of themselves would die.

They might eat just to have the energy to keep fighting bad things, but it’s doubtful that food would be digested well if they only ate for that reason. It’s better for someone to eat because they enjoy their food than to eat only because they want to help others.
