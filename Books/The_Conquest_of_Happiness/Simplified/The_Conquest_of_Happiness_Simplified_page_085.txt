The problem is that the pleasures which are easiest to get and seem fun at first often end up making people feel tired and stressed. Wanting too much excitement can mean someone has a troubled mind or is unhappy inside.

At the start of a happy marriage, most men don’t feel the need for excitement. But today, many have to wait a long time before they can afford to get married. By then, they have gotten used to needing excitement, and it’s hard to stop wanting it.

If society let men marry at twenty-one without all the money problems that come with marriage now, many would not look for exciting things that are as tiring as their jobs. But saying this out loud is seen as wrong, like what happened to Judge Lindsey. He was criticized a lot even though he had done good things, just because he wanted to help young people avoid problems caused by older people’s strict rules.

I won’t talk more about this now because it fits under the topic of Envy, which we will talk about later.
