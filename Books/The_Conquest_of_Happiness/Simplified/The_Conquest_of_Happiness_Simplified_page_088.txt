Chapter 6: Envy

After worry, one of the biggest reasons people feel unhappy is envy. Envy is a strong feeling that many people have. You can even see it in babies before they turn one year old. Teachers and parents need to be very careful with it.

If one child seems to get more attention than another, the kids notice right away and feel upset. It’s very important to be fair and treat all kids the same. But kids show their envy more openly than adults do.

Adults feel envy just as much as kids. For example, I remember when one of our maids, who was married, got pregnant. We told everyone she didn’t have to do heavy lifting. Right away, the other maids also refused to do heavy work, and we had to do it ourselves.
