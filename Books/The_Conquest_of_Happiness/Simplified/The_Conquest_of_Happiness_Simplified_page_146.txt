Chapter 9: Fear of what people think

Most people can't be truly happy unless the way they live and what they believe is accepted by the people around them, especially those they live with.

Modern societies are split into groups that have very different morals and beliefs. This started a long time ago with the Renaissance or the Reformation and has become stronger over time.

There were Protestants and Catholics who disagreed not just about religion but many everyday things. There were also aristocrats who allowed certain behaviors that middle-class people didn't accept. Later, free-thinkers appeared who didnâ€™t follow religious rules.
