Among normal, respectable women, envy is a really big deal. If you’re sitting on the subway and a well-dressed woman walks by, watch how the other women look at her. Almost all of them, except maybe those who are dressed better, will give her mean looks and try to find bad things about her.

Loving gossip comes from this jealousy: any story that makes another woman look bad is believed right away, even if there’s very little proof. Having strict morals works the same way: people get jealous of those who might break the rules, and it’s seen as good to punish them for it. This kind of “being good” is a reward all by itself.

The same thing happens with men, but women see all other women as their rivals. Men usually only feel this way about other men who have the same job.
