These things don’t give him nightmares or make him see his mother looking at him with disappointment. Why does his inner sense of right and wrong not match up with logic? It’s because the rules he learned as a kid were silly.  

They weren’t based on understanding how a person should act in their community. Instead, they came from old, unreasonable beliefs. Also, these rules had a strange, unhealthy feeling that came from the problems in the dying Roman Empire.  

Our so-called morals were made by priests and women who didn’t think freely. It’s time for men who live normal lives to stand up and reject these weird ideas.  

But if this rebellion is going to help someone be truly happy and live honestly without switching between two different rules, they need to really think and feel about what their own reason tells them.
