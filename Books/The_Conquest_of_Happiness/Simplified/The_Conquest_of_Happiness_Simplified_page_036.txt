Groups of writers often don’t connect with real life, and this connection is important if people’s feelings are going to be deep and serious enough for real sadness or true happiness.

To all the talented young people who feel like there’s nothing for them to do, I would say: stop trying so hard to write, and instead try not to write. Go out and live your life; be a pirate, a king in Borneo, or a worker in Soviet Russia. Live a life where just meeting your basic needs takes up all your energy.

I don’t think everyone should do this, only those who feel stuck like the problem Mr. Krutch talks about. I believe that after some years of living like this, the person who used to be an intellectual will find they can’t stop writing anymore. When that happens, their writing will no longer feel pointless.
