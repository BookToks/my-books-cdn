There are many ways to be excited or interested in things. Remember Sherlock Holmes? He once picked up a hat he found on the street. After looking at it for a bit, he said the owner was having problems because of drinking, and his wife didn’t like him as much as before. Life is never boring for someone who can find so much to notice in simple things.

Think about all the different things you might see on a walk in the countryside. One person might care about the birds, another about the plants, someone else about the rocks, and another about farming. Any of these things can be interesting if you care about them. Usually, people who have something they are interested in are better at dealing with the world than those who don’t.
