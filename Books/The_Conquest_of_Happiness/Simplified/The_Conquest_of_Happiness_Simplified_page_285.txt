Happiness doesn’t usually just happen by luck, like picking a ripe fruit. That’s why I named this book The Conquest of Happiness.  

The world is full of problems—some we can avoid, some we can’t—like sickness, mental struggles, fights, poverty, and people being mean. To be happy, a person has to find ways to deal with all these things that can make life hard.  

Sometimes, happiness comes easily. For example, a person with a happy nature, lots of money, good health, and simple needs might have an easy life and not understand why others complain. Or a pretty woman who doesn’t like to work, marries a rich husband, and doesn’t mind getting a bit overweight might live comfortably if she’s lucky with her kids.  

But these easy cases are very rare.
