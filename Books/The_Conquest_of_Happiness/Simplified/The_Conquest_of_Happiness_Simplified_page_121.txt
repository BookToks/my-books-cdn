But it’s really hard for someone who feels guilty all the time to have this kind of attitude. It comes from being calm and confident in yourself. It means all parts of your mind—what you’re aware of, what you’re not aware of, and what’s deep inside—work well together instead of fighting with each other.

Most people can create this kind of balance through good teaching and learning. But if someone hasn’t had that, it’s harder to fix. This is what psychoanalysts try to do, but I think a lot of people can do it themselves without needing a professional.

Don’t say, “I’m too busy for this kind of thinking; I have lots to do and I’ll just ignore what’s going on in my mind.” Nothing makes you less happy or less effective than having a mind that’s fighting with itself. Spending time to make all parts of your personality work together is really worth it. I’m not saying you need to spend an hour every day checking yourself.
