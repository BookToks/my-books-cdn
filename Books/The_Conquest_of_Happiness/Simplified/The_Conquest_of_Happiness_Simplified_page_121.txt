But such an attitude is scarcely possible to the man haunted by a sense of sin. It is an outcome of poise and selfreliance; it demands what may be called mental integration; by which I mean that the various layers of a man’s nature, conscious, subconscious, and unconscious, work together harmoniously and are not engaged in perpetual battle. To produce such harmony is possible in most cases by wise education, but where education has been unwise it is a more difficult process. It is the process which the psycho-analysts attempt, but I believe that in a very great many cases the patient can himself perform the work which in more extreme cases requires the help of the expert. Do not say, ‘I have no time for such psychological labours; my life is a busy one filled with affairs, and I must leave my unconscious to its tricks.’ Nothing so much diminishes not only happiness but efficiency as a personality divided against itself. The time spent in producing harmony between the different parts of one’s personality is time usefully employed. I do not suggest that a man should set apart, say, an hour a day for self-examination.
