People often act out of fear and want to find a safe place away from harsh criticism. Many old single men find comfort in their own homes.

I lived too long in the Victorian era to be considered modern by Mr. Krutch’s ideas. I still believe in love, but not the kind the Victorians liked. The love I believe in is brave and honest. It helps us understand good things but doesn’t ignore the bad, and it’s not seen as perfect or holy. The reason Victorians thought love had to be pure came from their fear of sex. They believed most sex was bad and added fancy words to the kind of love they approved of. Back then, people wanted sex more than now, which made them think sex was super important, like strict religious people do. Today, many people have dropped old rules but haven’t found clear new ones yet.
