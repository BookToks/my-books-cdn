Love can break through a person’s tough ego because it is a kind of teamwork where each person’s feelings help the other achieve their natural goals.

Throughout history, there have been different ideas about how to live alone. Some, like the Stoics and early Christians, thought a person could reach the best life by using only their own will, without help from others. Some believed that gaining power was the main goal, while others thought just having fun was what mattered most.

These ideas are called solitary philosophies because they say the good life can be reached by one person alone, not needing a group or community.

I think these ideas are wrong, not just in theory but also because they don’t match what our instincts tell us. People need to work together, and nature has given us, though not perfectly, the feelings that help us be friendly and cooperate with each other.
