You shouldn’t think that something as bad as envy can ever lead to good results. So, people who want big changes in society and more fairness need to hope that other feelings, not envy, will help make those changes happen.

Bad things are all connected, and one problem can cause another. For example, being really tired often makes people feel envious. When someone feels like they can’t handle their work, they get unhappy and may start envying people who have easier jobs. One way to reduce envy is to help people feel less tired.

But the most important thing is to have a life that feels good and natural. A lot of envy that looks like it’s about work actually comes from deeper feelings about relationships. A man who is happy with his marriage and kids usually doesn’t feel much envy toward others who are richer or more successful, as long as he can raise his children the way he thinks is right.
