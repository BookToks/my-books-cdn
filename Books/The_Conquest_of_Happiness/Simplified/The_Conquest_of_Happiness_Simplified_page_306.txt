In a way, he is right. It’s true that you shouldn’t be selfish all the time, but your own happiness should still be important in what you do. For example, if a man asked a woman to marry him just because he really wanted her to be happy, and also because he thought she would give him chances to forget about himself, she might not be very happy about that.

We should want the people we love to be happy, but not instead of our own happiness. Actually, the idea that you have to choose between yourself and others goes away when you truly care about other people or things. When you care, you start to feel like you’re part of life’s flow, not like a hard ball that only bumps into others.

All sadness comes from feeling broken or not connected. Sometimes this happens inside us when our thoughts and feelings don’t match. Sometimes it happens between us and society when we don’t feel connected through shared interests or love.
