A man who uses ‘bad language’, like swearing, isn’t really worse than someone who doesn’t, if you think about it logically. But almost everyone, when imagining a saint, thinks that not swearing is very important. Thinking this way, based on reason, doesn’t make much sense.

The same idea goes for alcohol and tobacco. In Southern countries, people don’t feel bad about drinking alcohol, and it even seems disrespectful to think it’s wrong because Jesus and his followers drank wine. For tobacco, it’s easier to say it’s bad since the greatest saints lived before people used it. But even here, there’s no logical reason to say saints wouldn’t smoke.

The reason people think saints wouldn’t do things just because they enjoy them is because of an old idea that saints shouldn’t do anything just for pleasure. This idea is a part of regular morals that we don’t really notice, but it makes our moral rules not very logical. In a logical moral system, it would be good to enjoy things and make others enjoy them too, as long as no one gets hurt.
