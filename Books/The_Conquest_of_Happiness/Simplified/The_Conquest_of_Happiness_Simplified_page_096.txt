Envy is a kind of bad feeling that comes from looking at things not for what they really are, but only by comparing them to others. For example, imagine I earn just enough money to live comfortably. I should feel happy about that, but then I hear someone else, who I don’t think is better than me, makes twice as much money. Right away, if I’m the jealous type, I stop feeling satisfied and start feeling like it’s unfair.

The best way to fix this is to train your mind not to think these useless, negative thoughts. After all, what’s better to want than happiness? If I can stop feeling jealous, I can be happy and make others wish they were like me. The guy who makes twice as much money as me is probably stressed because someone else makes even more than him, and it never ends. 

If you want fame, you might envy someone like Napoleon. But Napoleon admired Caesar, Caesar looked up to Alexander, and Alexander probably wished he was like Hercules, who wasn’t even real. So, you can’t stop feeling jealous just by being successful, because there will always be someone in history or stories who did better than you.
