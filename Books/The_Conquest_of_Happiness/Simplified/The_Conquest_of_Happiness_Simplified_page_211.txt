People who feel safe and secure in life are usually happier than those who feel unsure or scared, as long as their confidence doesnâ€™t get them into trouble. In many cases, feeling secure can actually help someone avoid problems that might cause others to fail.

For example, if you are walking across a narrow plank over a deep gap, you are more likely to fall if you are afraid than if you stay calm. The same idea works in life. A brave person might still face sudden problems, but they are more likely to get through tough situations without falling apart, unlike someone who is too scared.

This kind of confidence comes in many forms. Some people feel confident on mountains, some on the sea, and others in the air. But overall, feeling confident in life mostly comes from getting enough of the right kind of love and support.
