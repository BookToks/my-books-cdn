Today, we might not like his style, but at least he was real. Rich people now are very different. They never read books. If they want to have a fancy art collection to look important, they ask experts to pick the paintings. They don’t enjoy looking at the art; they just like stopping other rich people from having it.

When it comes to music, if a rich person is Jewish, they might truly enjoy it. If not, they usually don’t care about music or other arts. Because of this, rich people don’t know how to spend their free time.

As they get richer, making money gets easier and easier. Soon, just a few minutes a day can earn them more money than they can use. So, even though they have lots of success, they end up bored and with nothing to do.

This will keep happening as long as people think success is the main goal in life. If no one teaches you what to do after you succeed, then success will only leave you feeling bored.
