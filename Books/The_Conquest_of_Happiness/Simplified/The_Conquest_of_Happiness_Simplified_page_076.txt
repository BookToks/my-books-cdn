I have done a lot of public speaking. At first, every audience scared me, and being nervous made me speak badly. I was so afraid of speaking that I wished I might break my leg before I had to talk. After I finished, I felt really tired from being so nervous.

Slowly, I taught myself that it didn’t matter if I spoke well or badly. The world would keep going either way. I found that the less I cared about speaking perfectly, the better I spoke. Over time, my nervousness almost disappeared.

A lot of nervous stress can be handled like this. What we do isn’t as important as we think. Our wins and losses don’t really matter that much. Even big sadnesses can be gotten through. Problems that seem like they’ll ruin our happiness can fade with time until we barely remember how bad they felt.

Besides all this, it’s important to know that our own importance isn’t that big in the world. People who focus on things bigger than themselves can find a kind of peace that selfish people can’t.
