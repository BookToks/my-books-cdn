Yellow people don’t like white people, white people don’t like black people, and so on. You might think this hate is caused by propaganda, but that’s not the whole story. 

Propaganda works better when it makes people hate than when it tries to make them like each other. That’s because people today are more likely to feel hate than friendship. 

This happens because people are unhappy. Deep down, maybe without even realizing it, they feel like they’ve missed out on the true meaning of life. They think others have gotten the good things nature offers, but they haven’t. 

Even though people today have more fun and pleasure than in the past, they still feel like they could have so much more. 

If you ever take your kids to the zoo, you might notice something sad in the eyes of the apes when they’re not showing off or eating. It’s like they feel a quiet kind of sadness.
