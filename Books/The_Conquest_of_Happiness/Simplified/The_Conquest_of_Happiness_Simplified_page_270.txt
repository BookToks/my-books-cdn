Even if he has to think hard to understand what he reads, reading is still relaxing because it’s not about his responsibilities. If the book catches his attention, his interest is more casual compared to books about his own work. I want to talk about interests like these that are outside a person’s main activities.

One reason people feel unhappy, tired, and stressed is that they can’t care about anything that doesn’t directly affect their lives. Because of this, their mind keeps worrying about a few things, which causes anxiety. When they aren’t sleeping, their mind never gets a break to relax and think calmly. This leads to being easily annoyed, less wise, grumpy, and losing a balanced view on things. All these feelings both cause and come from being tired. The more tired a person gets, the less interested they are in things outside their problems, and without these distractions, they get even more exhausted.
