When we have to admit that we have faults, we often take it way too seriously.

No one should expect to be perfect or get too upset about not being perfect.

Feeling like everyone is against you usually comes from thinking way too highly of yourself. For example, I’m a playwright; to anyone fair, it’s clear I’m the best one around. But for some reason, my plays rarely get performed, and when they do, they don’t do well. Why is that?

Obviously, the managers, actors, and critics are all working against me for some reason.

The reason is actually something good about me: I refused to bow down to the big names in the theater world; I didn’t try to please the critics; my plays say things that upset the people they’re about. So, my amazing talent just doesn’t get recognized.
