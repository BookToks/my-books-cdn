When we are compelled to admit that we have faults, we take this obvious fact far too seriously.
 
 Nobody should expect to be prefect, or be unduly troubled by the fact that he is not.
 
 Persecution mania is always rooted in a too exaggerated conception of our own merits. I am, we will say, a playwright; to every unbiased person it must be obvious that I am the most brilliant playwright of the age. Nevertheless, for some reason, my plays are seldom performed, and when they are, they are not successful. What is the explanation of this strange state of affairs?
 
 Obviously that managers, actors, and critics have combined against me for one reason or another.
 
 The reason, of course, is highly creditable to myself: I have refused to kow-tow to the great ones of the theatrical world; I have not flattered the critics; my plays contain home truths which are unbearable to those whom they hit. And so my transcendent merit languishes unrecognised.
