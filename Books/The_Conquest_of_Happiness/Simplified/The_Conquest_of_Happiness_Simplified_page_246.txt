When parents fight with their kids, they lose the happiness they hoped for. After taking care of their child for so long, they feel upset when the child turns out different from what they wanted. They might have wanted him to be a soldier, but he becomes someone who hates fighting. Or like Tolstoy, they wanted him to be peaceful, but he joins a group that’s very aggressive.

But these problems don’t just happen later on. If you keep feeding a baby who can already feed himself, you’re putting your need to control above what’s best for the child. Even if you think you’re just being kind by saving him the trouble, it’s not helpful. If you make a child too scared of danger, you might just want to keep him needing you. If you show a lot of love but expect the child to always return it, you might be trying to trap him with his feelings.

Parents often want to hold on too tightly to their kids in many small ways. Unless parents are really careful or very pure in heart, this need to control can cause problems. These days, parents who know about these risks sometimes lose confidence in raising their kids. This can make things worse because kids get worried when adults aren’t sure or confident. Kids need adults who are calm and sure, even if they make some mistakes.
