Kids should mostly enjoy things they find by exploring and being creative. Fun activities that are exciting but don’t need any physical effort, like going to the theater, should happen only once in a while. That kind of excitement is like a drug—you’ll want more and more of it—and sitting still while excited goes against what’s natural.

A child grows best when, like a young plant, they stay in the same place without too many changes. Traveling a lot or seeing too many new things isn’t good for kids and can make them unable to handle simple, calm times as they get older.

I don’t mean that boring routines are good by themselves; I just mean that some good things only happen when you have some kind of routine. For example, take Wordsworth’s Prelude. Anyone can see that the deep thoughts and feelings in his work wouldn’t be possible for a city kid who’s always busy and distracted.
