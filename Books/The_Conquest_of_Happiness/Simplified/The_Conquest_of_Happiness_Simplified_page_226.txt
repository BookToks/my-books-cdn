If a girl lost her innocence because of a tricky person, her situation was really sad. This is shown clearly in The Vicar of Wakefield: The only way to hide her guilt, to cover her shame from everyone, to make her lover feel sorry, is to die.

Today, young women don’t think dying is necessary in these situations. If she has a good education, she can easily earn money and live on her own, so she doesn’t need her parents’ approval. Since parents don’t control their daughters’ money anymore, they are less likely to criticize them; there’s no point in yelling at someone who won’t listen.

So, unmarried young women from professional families can now have a happy life, as long as they are smart and attractive enough and don’t want to have children.
