This is true for many revolutionaries, soldiers, and others who believe in using violence. Usually, without even realizing it, they are driven by hatred. Their real goal is to destroy what they hate, and they don’t care much about what happens afterward.

I can’t say that destroying things doesn’t bring some joy. It can be a stronger, more intense kind of joy sometimes, but it doesn’t feel as deeply good because the result isn’t very satisfying. You defeat your enemy, but when they’re gone, your purpose is gone too, and the happiness from winning disappears quickly.

Building something, on the other hand, is great to look at when it’s finished. Also, it’s never really finished because there’s always more to improve or create. The best goals are the ones that keep going from one success to another without stopping. For this reason, building and creating bring more happiness than destroying.
